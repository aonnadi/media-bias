Hoo boy.Both new and used prices have stopped skyrocketing. In fact, both dipped slightly in February.But the average new-vehicle transaction price is still $48,763, according to Kelley Blue Book. Before the pandemic, the average new vehicle sold for $37,876.At an auto show this year, Noah and India Grabisch of Laurel, Md., were looking at new SUVs, which they liked. But an $86,000 price tag for a Chevrolet Suburban?Well ...""It looks nice,"" India Grabisch said. ""But ... no.""The used-car market doesn't provide much relief either. Retail used-vehicle prices now average $26,510.And after falling last year, closely watched wholesale prices, a key indicator of where markets are headed, are actually rising again.Why are prices remaining stubbornly high? Here are a few reasons.Supply chain woes are still reverberatingThe semiconductor shortage has gotten much better since 2021, but it hasn't gone away entirely, and other supply chain snarls continue to periodically disrupt output.Because of these supply chain problems, the global automotive industry has produced millions fewer vehicles than it would have otherwise.The supply of new vehicles is starting to improve, but those millions of ""missing"" vehicles are still gone. Lower supply, higher prices: It's basic economics.Which cars are being made? Not the cheap onesWhen automakers can't make as many vehicles as they would like, they prioritize their most profitable cars. Cheap ones get the boot.Consider what happened at Nissan, which continued to struggle with supply chain challenges throughout 2022. In response, it cut production of one of its cheapest cars, the Nissan Versa, by 78%. Nissan also reduced sales of two other cheap models, the Sentra and the Kicks.Bigger, slightly more expensive vehicles, like the Altima and the Pathfinder? Nissan boosted production of those.It wasn't because of a lack of buyers on the cheap end, says Judy Wheeler, Nissan U.S.'s vice president for sales and regional operations.""In the last month, we have seen search increase for the Nissan Versa, Sentra and Kicks, indicating a growing interest in this segment among consumers,"" she told NPR via email.She said Nissan intends to build more of those entry-level vehicles when the supply chain permits.It's not just Nissan. Across the board, automakers have been focusing on bigger, more luxurious, more expensive vehicles. And the ones they make also tend to be packed with extra features that bump up prices even more.Fewer cars — and higher prices — are very profitableThe shift in the market has been remarkable, and automakers are in no hurry to reverse course.Consider just how big the change has been. Cox Automotive crunched the numbers and found that from December 2017 to December 2022, sales of new cars under $25,000 — affordable, by new-car standards — dropped 78% and went from almost 13% of total new-vehicle sales to just under 4%.Sales of new cars over $60,000, meanwhile, skyrocketed. Those vehicles, costing more than the annual income of the average American, went from 8% of the auto market to 25% of sales.Because those $60,000 vehicles are significantly more profitable than the $25,000 ones, this shift is very, very lucrative for car companies. And they're especially focused on fat margins, instead of big volumes, because they're investing heavily in new electric vehicles (EVs).""The pricing environment that we're in right now has been very good, very robust,"" General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors on an earnings call last year. ""And ... running the business for cash flow is critical to help fund our journey in the EV transformation.""Yesterday's new cars are today's used cars ...Three years ago, when production lines started to slow, it affected both the new- and used-car markets immediately. Fewer new cars sent new prices up. That, in turn, pushed many shoppers into the used-car market. And more shoppers in the used market pushed prices up there, too.But the new-car woes also had a delayed effect on the used-car market — because new cars, obviously, become used cars after some time.So all those top-of-the line cars that were made in 2021 are now some very nice two-year-old cars, which means even in the used market, the high end of the market is booming.Meanwhile, because automakers cut production of cheap, no-frill sedans, people looking for cheaper late-model used cars are now out of luck.""We are firmly in the teeth of an extremely tight used-vehicle market, and that is directly a function of what has happened over the past three years,"" says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.Lonnie Smith, president of the nonprofit On the Road Lending, works to help working families get affordable loans for decent used cars, preferably those still under warranty.""Typically we're looking for vehicles that are two to four years old, less than 60,000 miles — a modest type of vehicle,"" he says.Those have gotten so hard to find lately that On the Road got licensed to be an auto dealer so it could buy vehicles at auction — the few cars that fit the bill on dealer lots were getting snapped up immediately.And the average loan for those cars, which was $13,000 ten years ago, has now risen to $24,000.Because, well, that's just the price of a modest used car in America these days.But there is some hope: EV prices could come downAs the chip shortage eases, automakers say they want to make more vehicles for people who can't afford top-of-the-line full-size SUVs. But don't expect a tsunami of $15,000 cars.""We're not really expecting to see, you know, this resurgence of inexpensive gasoline-powered vehicles,"" says Ed Kim, chief analyst at AutoPacific. ""Really where the industry is going is putting in a lot of effort to get more affordable plug-in vehicles out in the marketplace.""In fact, led by Tesla's aggressive price cuts, electric vehicle prices are dropping. According to the latest Kelley Blue Book data, they're down 7.5% year over year, and that's before federal tax credits (including for used vehicles).But there are daunting challenges — especially around charging infrastructure — before many car buyers will purchase an EV. And prices have a long way to fall before they're truly affordable. Investors were recently disappointed when Tesla, which has long promised a cheaper vehicle, did not unveil one.So cheaper vehicles are on the way. But many of them will be powered by batteries, and they'll take a long time to get here. [Copyright 2023 NPR]"

""We hear from residents across every single neighborhood just how dire it is and we see families who are getting pushed out of the communities that they grew up in and helped to build. This is affecting everything from how our businesses and economy can recover to our school enrollment and the stability of every part of our neighborhoods.""The topic of rent controlwas controversial even beforethe city began discussing Wu’s proposal in earnest.The mayor is seeking to usurp a 1990s statewide ban on the policy and restore a local form of rent control in Boston. Even though a recent poll suggests the policy is popular among likely voters statewide, the Massachusetts Legislature hasshown little appetite for taking up the issue.""The goal, as always, is to be in a conversation with our city government, with our residents, with our state government,"" Wu said when asked about the measure's likelihood of success on Beacon Hill. ""We all represent the same constituents, we all hear from the same families who are struggling to hang on in the city. ... I think we all share an urgency in knowing that this can't stand for Boston.""Wu has largely been alone as a city executive championing the issue. Mayors from several of Massachusetts' largest cities, including Cambridge, Fall River and Lynn, have indicated they have no plans to pursue their own rent control proposals. So far, only the city of Somerville, which previously had a rent control policy, has begun exploring a local option.Somerville City Council President Ben Ewen-Campen said the city's proposal is in its early stages, but they hope to present a finalized version for approval on Beacon Hill this fall. He noted that Somerville has previously sought — and failed — to bring back rent control. But he is more hopeful this time around.""I think we're at a really important point where we have a governor who has indicated that she is supportive of municipalities taking this step,"" Ewen-Campen said.He said he considers rent control a reasonable approach to help working class people live in the city.""The extreme position is what we have now,"" he explained, ""where some real estate investor or some LLC can buy up an apartment building and jack up the rent 30%, 40%, 100% and just evict people who have been in Somerville for years and have kids in the schools.""In Boston, Wu’s rent control proposal has upset both those with interests in the real estate sector and progressive housing advocates. TheMassLandlords trade groupand the Greater Boston Real Estate Board have publicly lobbied against Wu’s proposal, arguing that it would stifle housing production and worsen the city’s housing crisis.MassLandlords also argued Wu’s proposal, which exempts owners who live with their tenants and own six units or less, leaves out landlords who don’t live with their tenants, but still reside within the city of Boston.Councilor Michael Flaherty proposed an ultimately unsuccessful amendment to address that concern. Multiple councilors spoke against it, arguing that there’s a distinction between landlords who live with their renters and those who own investment properties.Meanwhile, housing advocates wanted totighten portions of Wu’s planby lowering the annual increase beyond 10% in high inflation years, or the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years.Wu’s proposal exempts college-operated dormitories and residential buildings for 15 years beginning from the date of their certificate of occupancy. It would also establish eviction protections and bar a landlord from recovering possession of a unit unless a housing court approves.Wu’sagency restructure planwould, if approved by the Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey, formally dissolve the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the official entity created in 1957 to oversee the city’s development activities in the era of urban renewal. The measure would codify a focus on three key planning principles — resilience, affordability and equity — and would also dissolve the partner Economic Development Industrial Corporation, established in 1971 to lead local economic development activities.Wu said Wednesday she expects ""strong"" support for the measure at the State House.The BRA began doing business as the Boston Planning and Development Agency in 2016 when then-Mayor Marty Walsh made a $600,000 bid to rebrand the agency to shed its reputation as inefficient and overly responsive to the desires of developers. Wu’s proposal would maintain the rebranded name.Councilors approved one amendment to Wu’s plan that maintains urban renewal land disposition agreements, area-specific restrictions that spell out what can and cannot be built in a given place.SeparatorGBH News reporter Tori Bedford contributed reporting on Somerville's rent control proposal."

My debit card expired, and I was slow to update the information about the new card at all the various places where it’s registered. I knew the old card was expired; I had cut it up for extra security. I was merrily attempting to make my purchases online and in person using the new debit card with the new expiration date. But it was denied and kept being denied.Since the old card was designated as the default payment, I was racking up a bunch of bouncebacks — denials — on attempted purchases which triggered the fraud algorithms. Though I ended up in several rounds of time-consuming conversations, I appreciated the assertive vigilance of the fraud team’s multiple-step verification process. And it turns out that being forced to navigate the process proved to be revealing in another way.Reviewing the attempted charges with the fraud team, I discovered most of the denied purchases were subscriptions. My seemingly endless list of subscriptions —to everything from artisan cosmetic products to niche newsletters, to small household products, to a number of others allowing certain websites’ content. The fraud alerts shut down the automatic billings until I could verify the charges giving me a fresh look at my weekly, monthly, bi-monthly and yearly subscriptions.Many of these subscriptions I had forgotten about or were impulse purchases that didn’t make any sense beyond the moment. Seriously, why do I have a subscription for a weekly specialty drink, when I rarely sip anything but water and coffee? Because in order to sample ONE of the specialty sips, I had to sign up for the free trial. I got distracted, missed the end of the free trial and here I am months later paying regularly for that singular sip. I haven’t even been back to the store to sample another!Of course, it’s my fault. Savvy marketers know just how to entice consumers like me into subscribing because they also know we will likely fail to pay attention to the details. And when you do pay attention, they don’t make it easy for you to unsubscribe.Truly, nobody has time or energy for the inevitable consumer tug-of-war best described by Michael Corleone’s iconic line from the Godfather Part 3 movie: “Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.” The Federal Trade Commission, charged with enforcing consumer protection against fraud, deception, and unfair practices, has heard from thousands about the problem. TheCommission’s recent proposalwould require businesses to alert consumers that their subscriptions are about to renew, and to stop companies from making special offers coupled with high pressure tactics to make you keep the subscription. The so-called “click to cancel” proposal would make it as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe.The agency is soliciting public comment on the proposal. Let the FTC know we want out when we want out — and not when businesses say so. In the meantime, you can spot me at the drink counter trying to get my money’s worth."

Many local and state governments are developing initiatives for reparations to balance the scales.Here in Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu marked the start of Black History Month byannouncing the members of a new task forceto study reparations, noting the ""brutal practice of enslavement"" along with policies such as redlining, the busing crisis, exclusion from secure and stable housing, and more. The task force — a multigenerational group of historians, activists and students — is planning on meeting soon to discuss their ideas on how to approach the complexity of reparatory justice. As they do the meticulous work of documentation and reflection over the next year, the city will wait to look with a careful eye at their conclusions.Addressing systemic racism and the harms caused by slavery is about more than just financial compensation for descendants of enslaved people. Guests onBasic Blacksaid the efforts should also work to address other challenges facing the African American community such as health care access, housing access, psychological harm and the erasure of Black history, among many other issues.Carrie Mays, a member of Boston's Task Force on Reparations and student at UMass Boston, said reparations should be viewed as a starting point for further conversation and work.""Reparations is not going to stop police from killing Black men in the streets,"" Mays said. ""Reparations is not going to stop Black women from dying at the highest demographical number when it comes to the medical field. Reparations is not going to stop the mass incarceration machine system that we're seeing today.""Even though slavery was abolished more than 150 years ago, Mays said reparations are important because Black communities are still suffering at the expense of white supremacy, and white communities are still benefitting from privilege.""You cannot talk about the systemic issues of today without talking about slavery, without talking about colonialism, without talking about how this is a connected timeline,"" Mays said.George “Chip” Greenidge, a task force member and founder and director of Greatest MINDS, said he's proud of Mayor Wu for taking on this initiative, which he said has been brewing for quite awhile.""I really want to push on intergenerational poverty that we've seen in the city. I think there are certain families born and raised here that have been in the cycle of intergenerational poverty,"" Greenidge said. ""How can we help them break through those cycles?""Overall, there simply won't be enough money to compensate all descendants of slaves, said Traci Griffith, director of the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. That's why compensation will have to come in more creative ways that address harms such as redlining, busing and other inequities.""I would really strongly urge the task force to look at the multiple ways in which compensation could happen. It isn't necessarily a dollar amount. It really feels as if there's so many other ways in which it can be addressed, and I think they really need to be creative about that,"" Griffith said.The Boston Task Force on Reparations has 10 members. It is currently looking for a research partner to aid in studying the lasting impacts of slavery in Boston.

This week marks one year since the company announced its Live and Work Anywhere policy, and now, it's time to gloat.""The business has actually never performed better since we moved to this program,"" says Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson. ""It's working really well for us.""Other companies, including tech ones, are taking a very different path.The Pew Research Center found that among people whose jobs can be done remotely, just over a third are still working from home all the time, down from 43% a year ago.At Airbnb, all but a very few employees have a choice: They can work from home (anywhere in the country where they're based), or they can go into an Airbnb office (there are 26 of them around the world).Regardless of where they live, they keep their same salary.And they aren't bound by geography, with the company allowing them to work in over 170 other countries for up to 90 days per year per country. Airbnb is talking to governments abroad about making it easier for all people to work around the world.Talent doesn't want to be tied downThere is an obvious business interest here. People who can jet off somewhere with their laptops are potential Airbnb guests and hosts.Freeing people from the office has also provided savings for the company, whose office footprint is now less than half of what it was before the pandemic.Still, Stephenson insists that Live and Work Anywhere is really about winning the global war for talent.""The best talent in the world is not all within a 50-mile radius of San Francisco,"" he says.And that talent, Stephenson says, no longer wants to be tied down.Before the pandemic, 95% of Airbnb employees lived near a company office. Now, almost a quarter of employees are more than 50 miles from an office, beyond a comfortable commute.A migration out of San FranciscoSteve Stecher has gone even farther than an hour's drive.Stecher moved his family out of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco during the pandemic, and since last fall they have spent most of their time in Buenos Aires.That has dramatically changed their financial picture, says Stecher, a senior manager of quality assurance at Airbnb.""Don't repeat this to my boss, but I think it's about 30%, or maybe 40% maximum, of the cost of living in the Bay Area,"" he says.Stecher manages a team of about 140 people, many of whom have also moved out of California, but primarily to the Midwest and East Coast where they have family, he says.""We did used to have a lot of fun in person,"" Stecher says about one of the tradeoffs in his new life.Airbnb now flies teams in for regular in-person gatherings, which the company sees as critical to success.""We are not remote first. We are just being intentional about how we gather,"" says Stephenson. ""It's not a random three days a week where you hope to run into people at a water cooler.""Deploying a team called Ground Control, Airbnb works to ensure that the right people are in the right place at the right time for these large gatherings.""We're still learning the right rhythms for when people are getting together,"" Stephenson says. ""I think that's the biggest challenge that we have.""Catering to different needs, and a healthy bottom lineAirbnb added 900,000 hosts last year, reaching a total of 6.6 million worldwide. Revenue growth has been strong. Stephenson sees these as signs the company is moving in the right direction.Moreover, employees are happy. Airbnb's attrition rate is close to an all-time low and falling, the company says.And Airbnb's goal of hiring more women and under-represented minorities has gotten a boost from the new policy.""Now that we're in a live anywhere context, it really gives us an opportunity to cater to different needs,"" says Benny Etienne, a leader of Black@, the company's affinity group for Black employees. ""Within a diverse group, we all have very diverse identities and diverse realities.""So far, only about 20% of Airbnb employees have taken advantage of Live and Work Anywhere to relocate domestically or travel abroad.Etienne, who works for Ground Control out of Airbnb's Montreal office, is encouraging anyone who can take their work somewhere else to try it, at least for a week.""The change of scenery has a huge impact on your mental health,"" she says on a call from Mérida, Mexico, where she's spent most of the winter and spring.Further south, the savings that Stecher and his family have enjoyed since leaving San Francisco have allowed his wife Ana Ruiz, who worked in banking, to stay home with their children in Buenos Aires and also to travel, something the family is passionate about.""We were just in our own little world in the U.S.,"" says Ruiz, who grew up in Mexico. ""Now, to be in different parts of the world and live the culture and experience the food... and speaking a different language, it's just amazing. It's just so nice."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]"

Howard had become wealthy through the shipping trade, and while there is no record of him shipping slaves, he was moving cargo that was harvested by enslaved people, including logwood and tobacco. Howard’s wealth from that business allowed him to build a home of relative grandeur for the period.The Revere family moved into the home in 1770, five years before Paul Revere’s famous “midnight ride” to alert the countryside of the impending British assault. They sold the property in 1800.Revere’s other brush with the slave industry comes from his trade as a silversmith. Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts notes in its Revere silver collection that while Paul Revere likely melted down old coins or silver objects for his raw material, “the metal itself likely came from Mexico, mined by enslaved laborers.”Then, of course, there were his customers: wealthy Bostonians who may have enslaved people themselves or made their money through the slave trade.One of Revere’s most famous pieces is the “Sons of Liberty Bowl,” which he made to commemorate the heroes of the American Revolution. Among the names engraved on the bowl is Daniel Malcolm, who died in 1769. According to the city of Boston’s slavery database, probate records from that year show he enslaved two people.“This system [slavery] touched everyone,” including artists and patrons of the arts, said Ethan Lasser, chair of the Art of the Amercia’s department at the MFA. “Many of the people involved with the Liberty Bowl are the same patrons of portraits and furniture. And a lot of their wealth is either directly or indirectly connected to the Caribbean and to slavery.”Back to mapThis story is part of the projectEnslavement History of the Freedom Trail, a collaborative effort between GBH News and Boston University students to detail the mostly hidden history behind some of Boston's most well-known sites."

Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn’t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them.Rath:Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi:My championship word was ‘ancho.’Rath:How do you spell that?Tanoshi:You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath:I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi:It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers.Rath:Oh, right! That’s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right?

I’m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath:Tanoshi, I’m curious, what’s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi:Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath:And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi:Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It’s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he’ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I’m sure I’ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi:Me, too!Rath:It sounds like you have a good time together. That’s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi:I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year.Rath:Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:That’s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.?Tanoshi:Yeah. And I’m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath:So you’ll be heading to Washington in May.

When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending.The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternatemechanismthrough which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them.As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD.What OPAT facesThe abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking — especially given thehigh hopesthat accompanied Boston’s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case.Everett, who was appointed as OPAT’s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role.Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.“There are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,” Everett said. “They can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.”For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT’s existence may not be enough.“While we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don’t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,” she said. “I started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it’s also a very hard ask. They don’t know who I am. They don’t know who this agency is. ... We’re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.”OPAT, which was created by a 2020 cityordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD’s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review.Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under theordinancethat created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annualreportsent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether.In that same report, Everett said OPAT’s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission — like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder.In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it’s often called,mandatedthat investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted.“Our department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,” Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement.National backdropGianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected.“It’s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,” Irlando said. “You have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you’re going to have access situations — because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don’t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.”Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it’s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity’s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don’t know or trust a particular oversight agency — or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well.Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who istracking and analyzingthe proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts.“The best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,” Fairley said. “And what’s good about what’s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, ‘OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.’ And then that audience — the public — can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.”Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Boardcan be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainantclaimedthey’d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent “audit” of the BPD’s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which theybelievedofficers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights.But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago’s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.“On paper, it looked fantastic,” Fairley said. “It was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have.“You are right to be watchful,” she added. “Because we want to make sure these entities as they’re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they’ve been given over time.”"

He last came on GBH’sAll Things Consideredto discuss his idea that the strange, extrasolar object known as Oumuamua might have been an interstellar alien spacecraft. Since then, he’s become even more serious about searching for evidence of alien intelligence with his own organization and with the Pentagon. Loeb returned toAll Things Consideredand joined host Arun Rath to explain his research in detail.Arun Rath:First off, give us a little bit of context on where we are with this situation. It was last summer when the Department of Defense created a new office to track unidentified aerial phenomenons — what we used to call unidentified flying objects or UFOs. But could you briefly explain what’s going on here, and why the Pentagon decided to get serious about this?Avi Loeb:About half a year ago, the director of the new office in government that deals with anomalies wrote me an email and said that he is visiting the Boston area in the coming weeks and asked me whether I’m available to meet with him. I said yes, of course, and he came to my home. As a result of that, we wrote a scientific paper together in which we talked about the physical constraints that can be put on unidentified objects based on the limited data we have.In thispaper, we speculated about possible scenarios by which probes may be released toward the Earth; for example, from a mothership, because the second interstellar meteor had the same distance of closest approach to the sun. So more and more, I thought to myself, “Well, maybe it was released by a smaller probe released by a mothership.” But then it turned out to have originated from a different direction, and so they were not actually related.But in the paper with Sean Kirkpatrick, we mentioned the possibility that the mothership would come by or pass near Earth — just like Oumuamua did — and release a lot of probes that can visit different planets in the habitable zone.Rath:Based on what we’ve seen of some of these objects, I imagine there’s an argument to be made that this technology would be beyond any of our adversaries.Loeb:Not necessarily. I think the government is confused. It’s unclear what the nature of these unidentified objects might be.From a scientific point of view, the fundamental question is whether there is even one object that is of extraterrestrial technological origin. That’s what theGalileo Projectthat I established a year and a half ago is trying to find out.We have an operating observatory at Harvard University that we assembled over the past year. It has infrared optical cameras and a radio and audio sensor that are monitoring the sky 24/7. The data is being fed to an artificial intelligence classification software that tries to figure out whether any of the objects we look at are natural in origin, like birds, or human-made objects, like drones, balloons or airplanes.My approach to this puzzle is that rather than deal with past events that were anecdotally reported with compromised instruments that we can never revisit because the data was collected from months or years ago, it’s much better to have instruments that are fully under our control.After all, the sky is not classified; it’s only the sensors that the government used that are classified that make the data classified. The best data is not available to us, to scientists, or to the public simply because it was collected by sensors that are classified that the government doesn’t want adversaries to be aware of.Rath:How much has your project, the Galileo Project, been involved with the Pentagon office? Have you been sharing a lot of data?Loeb:Well, the past couple of years were very interesting. After my book “Extraterrestrial” came out, a lot of high-level people came to my home. They included multibillionaires that funded the Galileo Project. They were inspired by the vision and the fact that there was no scientific search for technological devices near Earth from an extraterrestrial civilization, and also the fact that the first three out of four interstellar objects that were discovered over the past decade appear to be weird, unusual outliers relative to the rocks that we found from the solar system before the asteroids or the comets just over the past decade. We could find those objects that entered the solar system from outside with no survey telescopes, with no satellites the government employs.The first two were meteors roughly the size of a meter that collided with the Earth and burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere. We realized that both of them arrived from outside the solar system. They were moving very fast. So we discovered the first two interstellar meteors.Then, about seven months after the second one, there was the object, Oumuamua, which was discovered by a telescope in Hawaii. That object was much bigger, the size of a football field — about 200 times bigger than those meteors. It also looked weird because it had an extreme shape, most likely flat, and it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force without showing any cometary evaporation. There was no comet around it. I suggested it [the force] was the reflection of sunlight, and for that, the object had to be very thin, unlike the asteroids or comets we had seen before.And actually, three years later, the same telescope in Hawaii discovered another object with no cometary tail, and it ended up being a rocket booster that NASA launched in 1966. It had thin walls and was made of stainless steel, so clearly, it was artificial in origin; that’s why it didn’t evaporate, and we know it because we produced it.The question is: who produced Oumuamua, or the meteors? And I should say the meteors are also unusual in the sense that they are made of material that has a strength that is at least ten times bigger than all other space rocks in NASA’s catalog of meteors over the past decade. But it’s also possible that there are spacecrafts made of some artificial alloy, like stainless steel.We’re going to find out. We’ve planned an expedition to the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2023, and we will look for the fragments of the first interstellar meteor and try to figure out what it was made of.Rath:So if you recover this object deep in the Pacific, will that be the first interstellar object that we’ve recovered?Loeb:Yeah. It would be the first time that humans put their hands on the material that makes an object the size of a person from outside the solar system. So no matter what, it will be exciting. Since we expect its material strength to be quite unusual, we will learn something new, irrespective of whether it’s natural or artificial in origin. That’s why I find it exciting, and I’m willing to sleep on the deck next to the machine room for a couple of weeks this summer."

Not until later, after a tow truck came, did anyone realize someone was in the vehicle — and that they were still alive.""We do not know how long the Jeep was in the water,"" Capt. Chuck Rogers, an investigator at the Marion County Sheriff's Office, told NPR. And that's just one of several questions that remain unanswered about the unusual case.After that initial call on Friday morning, it took deputies around 18 minutes to reach the scene at Lake o' the Pines, which sits between Dallas and Shreveport, La. It took a little longer for a truck from a nearby wrecker service to arrive.The Jeep was far from shore, about 40 feet out in the water from Woody's Camp Boat Ramp. The fisherman who called the authorities stuck around, using his boat to help a tow-truck worker get out to the Jeep and hook up a tow cable, Rogers said.""It was at that time they saw the woman"" inside the Jeep, the captain added. Abruptly, what began as a salvage job became a rescue. The fisherman and tow-truck driver helped get the woman out of the vehicle, pulling her into the fishing boat.Deputies called an ambulance; in the meantime, the woman was put in a car to keep her warm. She was later taken to a hospital.The woman's identity has not been released.""During the incident, it was determined the woman was listed as a missing person from the Longview Texas Police Department,"" the Marion County Sheriff Office said.She had been reported missing hours earlier — at 12:35 a.m. on Friday — police in Longview, a town some 24 miles south-by-southwest of the lake, told NPR.Longview police said they couldn't share any more details about the woman or the circumstances that might have led to her predicament.""Given the details of this case, we are unable to release any information at this time,"" said Melissa Dobbs, records administrator at the Longview Police Department.As for how the Jeep came to be in the lake, the sheriff's department says it hasn't turned up anything suspicious about the incident. The boat ramp the vehicle apparently used to drive into the lake sits after a slight curve from a long and roughly straight rural road.""There was nothing uncovered during the investigation to suggest this case was anything more than an accident,"" Rogers said.

And they're giving you soooo many reasons why.They're going to middle school ... they need it to collaborate with peers on school projects ... they need it to tell you where they are ... when they'll be home ... when the school bus is late. It'll help you, dear parent, they vow. Plus, all their friends have one, and they feel left out. Come on! Pleeeeeeze.Before you click ""place order"" on that smartphone, pause and consider a few insights from a person who makes a living helping parents and tweens navigate the murky waters of smartphones and social media.Emily Cherkin spent more than a decade as a middle school teacher during the early aughts. She watched first-hand as the presence of smartphones transformed life for middle schoolers. For the past four years, she's been working as screen-time consultant, coaching parents about digital technology.Her first piece of advice about when to give a child a smartphone and allow them to access social media was reiterated by other experts over and over again: Delay, delay, delay.'I wish I knew then what I know now'""I have talked to hundreds of parents,"" Cherkin explains, ""and no one has ever said to me, 'I wish I gave my kid a phone earlier or I wish I'd given them social media access sooner. Never.""In fact, parents tell her the opposite.  ""I always hear, 'I wish I had waited. I wish I knew then what I know now,' "" she says, ""because boy, once you give a child one of these devices or technologies, it is so much harder to take it back.""Smartphones, social media, and video games create large spikes in dopamine deep inside a child's brain. As NPR has reported, those spikes pull the child's attention  to the device or app, almost like a magnet. They tell the child's brain that this activity is super critical – way more critical than other activities that trigger smaller spikes in dopamine, such as finishing homework, helping to clean up after dinner, or even playing outside with friends.Thus, parents set themselves up for a constant struggle when a child starts having their own smartphone, Cherkin says. ""It's the dopamine you're fighting. And that's not a fair fight. So I tell parents, 'Delay all of it just as long as you can,'"" she emphasizes.That means delaying, not just a smartphone, but any device, including tablets, she suggests. By introducing a tablet at an early age, even for educational purposes, parents can establish a habit that may be hard to break later, Cherkin has observed.""A child using a tablet at age 6 to 8 comes to expect screen time after school,"" she says. ""Flash forward to age 12, and now they have a phone. And when they come home from school, they're likely engaging with social media, instead of educational videos.""Neurologically children's brains haven't developed enough to handle the magnetic pull of these devices and the apps on them, says neuroscientist Anne-Noël Samaha at the University of Montreal.""It's almost as if you have the perfect storm,"" Samaha explains. ""You have games, social media, and even pornography and shopping online, and the brains of children are just not yet ready to have the level of self-control needed to regulate their behavior with these activities. Even adults sometimes don't have enough self-control to do that or handle some of the emotional impact of them.""Right-size your parenting fearsParents often feel like once their tween starts moving around more autonomously through their neighborhood or town more, the child needs a smartphone to be safe, Cherkin says. ""They may think, 'Oh, my gosh! My kid is going to be kidnapped on the way to school. They need a phone to call me.'But Cherkin notes that parents tend to overestimate the dangers of the ""real world."" and underestimate the dangers of a smartphone.""I think our fears are very misplaced,"" she says. ""We need to think about what is statistically really likely to happen versus what's really, really unlikely.""Each year in the U.S. about a hundred children are abducted by strangers or people or slight acquaintances, the U.S. Department of Justice reported. Given that 50 million children, ages 6 to 17, reside in the U.S, the risk of a child being kidnapped by a stranger is about 0.0002% each year. (By comparison, the risk of being struck by lightning each year is about 0.0001%.)On the other hand, giving a child a phone comes with a whole new set of risks and dangers, Cherkin says. They can be difficult for some parents to understand because they may not have much first-hand experience with specific apps, and the new threats that are emerging.Back in March, the nonprofit Common Sense Media surveyed about 1,300 girls, ages 11 to 15, about their experiences on social media. Nearly 60% of the girls who use Instagram, and nearly 60% of those who use Snapchat, said they had been contacted by a stranger that makes them uncomfortable. The same was true for 46% of those who use TikTok.Disturbing online encounters and influencesThe same survey found that these apps often expose girls to content they find disturbing or harmful. For those that use Instagram, TikTok or Snapchat, 12% to 15% of girls see or hear content related to suicide, on a daily basis. About the same percentage also said they see or hear content about eating disorders, on a daily basis as well.An investigation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate also found evidence that content related to suicide and disordered eating is relatively common on TikTok. In the investigation, the nonprofit set up eight accounts ostensibly by 13-year-old children. Each user paused on and liked videos about body image and mental health. Within 30 minutes, TikTok recommended content about suicide and eating disorders to all eight accounts.In one instance, this content began appearing in less than three minutes. On average, TikTok suggested content about eating disorders every 4 minutes to the teen accounts.TikTok declined NPR's request for an interview, but in an email, a spokesperson for the company wrote: ""We're committed to building age-appropriate experiences, while equipping parents with tools, like Family Pairing, to support their teen's experience on TikTok.""Emma Lembke, age 20, says these findings line up with what she experienced when she first went on Instagram eight years ago. ""As a 12-year-old girl, I felt like I was being constantly bombarded by bodies that I could never replicate or ones that I could try to, but it would lead me in a darker direction.""She remembers just trying to look up a healthy recipe. ""And from that one search, I remember being fed constant stuff about my '200-calorie day' or intermittent fasting.""Eventually she says, her feed was ""covered with anorexic, thin, tiny women. Dieting pills, lollipops to suppress my appetite.""Lembke developed an eating disorder. She has recovered, and now is a digital advocate and founder of the Log OFF project, which helps teens build healthier relationships with social media.""When I was younger,  I was being prodded and poked and fed material [on social media] that was really leading me in a direction toward an eating disorder,"" she says. ""I think for a lot of young women, even if it doesn't materialize into a fully fledged eating disorder, it painfully warps their sense of self by harming their body image. ""Instagram's parent company, Meta, declined a request for an interview. But in an email, a spokesperson said the company has invested in technology that finds and removes content related to suicide, self-injury or eating disorders before anyone reports it. ""We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we're doing to provide teens with safe, supportive experiences online,"" they wrote.A whole world of sexually explicit contentMany children also come across sexualized content, even porn, on social media apps, Cherkin says.If you want to get a sense for what your kid might encounter once you let them have a phone and popular apps, Cherkin recommends trying this: Set up a test account in one of the apps, setting the age of the user to your child's age, and then use the account yourself for a few weeks.""I did that with Snapchat. I set up an account, pretending to be 15. Then I just went to the Discover feed, where it pushes content to you based on your age,"" she explains. Within seconds, sexualized content and vulgar images appeared, she says. ""And I thought, 'No, this is not appropriate for a 15-year-old.""Snapchat's parent company, Snap, also declined a request for an interview with NPR. A spokesperson wrote in an email: ""We have largely kept misinformation, hate speech, and other potentially harmful content from spreading on Snapchat. That said, we completely understand concerns about the appropriateness of the content that may be featured, and are working to strengthen protections for teens with the aim of offering them  a more age-appropriate experience.""Personally, Cherkin uses Instagram for her business. And back in March, despite all her knowledge about the traps on social media, she says she ""got catfished."" She engaged with a stranger who seemed to be a teen in her DMs, and eventually received obscene and disturbing photos of a man's genitalia.She writes on her blog: ""It's graphic. It's gross. And this is one teeny (lol) example of what kids and teens see ALL THE TIME.""What's a parent to do? Consider smartphone alternativesIn the end, Cherkin says, there are several other in-between options for tweens besides giving them their own smartphone or denying them a phone altogether. You can:Share your phone with your tween so they can text with and call friends.Give your tween a ""dumb phone"" that only allows texting and calling. For example, buy an old-school flip phone. But if that's out of the question because it's not cool enough (and you have extra cash to spare), you can now buy dumb phones that look like smartphones but have extremely limited functions – no easy-access to the internet, no social media. And very little risk of inappropriate content.Try to limit the apps your child uses – but get ready to be busy monitoring themIf you do end up getting your tween a smart phone, Cherkin says, you might be tempted to simply ""block"" children from downloading particular apps on their phones. And in theory, this works. Parental control apps, such as Bark, can notify you when an app is installed.But, she says, many kids find workarounds to  this approach – and really any parental controls. For instance, she says, if you block Instagram on their phone, kids can login via the web. If you block TikTok, they might watch Tiktok videos in Pinterest. Kids can find porn on Spotify.""Kids are way tech savvier than we are,""  Cherkin wrote in an email. ""Remember how we used to program the VCR for our parents?! Every single parent who comes to me for help has a variation of this same story: 'We had X parental controls; we blocked X sites; our child figured out how to access them anyway.' ... It's impossible to successfully block everything — and once you do, a replacement will pop up in its place.""In other words, once you give your child a smartphone, you will likely be setting up yourself for a whole new series of parenting tasks and worries. Even Meta reveals this in its April ad for their parental controls: The mom in the ad is monitoring her son's Instagram account while doing the dishes.   [Copyright 2023 NPR]"

Loftus chronicled that hot dog summer in her new book “Raw Dog.” It’s essential reading about America’s favorite summer food and our occasionally complicated relationship to it.“There’s very little written about hot dogs, which is crazy to me,” Loftus said onBoston Public Radioon Friday. Loftus said most of what she read before writing this book was either “very pro-hot dog” or “the vegan lobby.”“I was excited to look at the pros and cons of hot dogs,” she said.Many people consider the hot dog an quintessentially American food, but the pink meat tube was born from a combination of food traditions from Germany, Greece, Poland and Austria, Loftus said.""Over a period of time, there were so many immigrants coming to the U.S. from those countries during the Depression and during the World Wars, and it just became a popular cheap food,"" she explained.During her hot dog tour, Loftus ate everything from a fish cake hot dog in Philly (a well-cooked hot dog with a fish cake flopped on top) to a bologna-wrapped and fried dog in Baltimore.Eating so many hot dogs was not always easy on the body, Loftus said.“I felt like I was on the verge of death,” she said about eating the Baltimore dog mere hours after enjoying a chili-drenched hot dog from Ben’s Chili Bowl.Her favorite hot dog stop in the country?Rutt’s Hutin Clifton, New Jersey. “They put it in the deep fryer for 4 seconds, and it just explodes,” said Loftus. “It costs like $3 on the side of the highway and it’s just the greatest thing in the world.”But after trying so many grilled, boiled and fried dogs that summer, Loftus says she prefers to keep it classic: a hot dog, split and grilled, on a toasted bun with ketchup, mustard and relish.Beyond the tastebud trials in her book, Loftus also explores the labor conditions for meatpackers and slaughterhouse workers who create the tubed meat. She said the already dangerous meatpacking plants remained open during the pandemic, and “it became the most dangerous job in the country.”In 2022, ProPublica published aninvestigationthat revealed meatpacking giants Tyson and Smithfield ignored pandemic health warnings and pushed back against public health officials, exposing their workers to the coronavirus.Outrage over working conditions has spilled over into more joyous hotdog events, like the Nathan’s Hot Dog eating contest. Protestors in 2022 crossed in front of famed eater Joey Chestnut with a sign that read “Expose Smithfield Death Star.” This was a great event to protest at, said Loftus, because Smithfield distributes a lot of Nathan's hot dogs.Loftus also writes about another hot dog cultural touchstone, the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. She interviewed drivers of the hot dog-shaped vehicles, most fresh out of college when they took on this yearlong job. Before getting behind the wheel, they attend training in Wisconsin for two weeks. Then the company pairs up its 12 drivers to take six Wienermobiles across the country and hand out Wienermobile-shaped whistles.“They basically put you into an arranged marriage with another Wienermoble driver, and then you're just with them nonstop for six months,” said Loftus. “And it ends with them either hating each other or getting married.”"

As cities like Boston pursue a winding path through the Legislature to try to impose local rent-stabilization policies, one state lawmaker is hoping to take the concept to voters once again.Cambridge Democrat Rep. Mike Connolly, who said he wasacting in his “personal capacity as a renter,”filed a petition that would lift the ban and revive rent control as an option for cities and towns that choose to adopt it.Uber and Lyft driver statusAn industry-backed coalition that wants to ensure drivers for platforms like Uber and Lyft retain their status as independent contractors is back for round two. But this time, organized labor is in the mix with its own question.The Supreme Judicial Court struck from last year’s ballot a question that would have written into law that the drivers are contractors rather than employees, leaving unsettled a fight that’s been simmering for years on Beacon Hill about the drivers’ status, rights and benefits. This year, the coalition filed nine versions of their question, trying to find the right language to fend off a potential court challenge.Backers of the question say contractor status allows for theindependence that many drivers prize, while opponents say it denies them the rights and benefits guaranteed to employees.The labor union 32BJ SEIU, meanwhile, put forward its own question that would allow the drivers to unionize, with the goal of being able tonegotiate their working conditions.MCAS as a graduation requirementAnother union with its sights on the 2024 ballot is the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which for years has been calling for changes to the state’s MCAS assessments.The MTA backs a question that would end the use of MCAS tests as a high school graduation requirement, and its board plans to decide at a Sunday meeting whether to launch a full union campaign in support of the initiative. A similar question was also filed by a Lexington mom.Critics of the MCAS say using the exam as a graduation requirement can be punitive, especially to students with special needs or those from marginalized groups. Supporters say it’s a crucial tool for ensuring uniform standards across districts and tracking whether students are getting the instruction they need.Election and voting reformsPetitioners filed eight different versions of a question that would require voters to show an ID at the polls. A similar proposal, which was backed by the Massachusetts Republican Party, failed to make last year’s ballot after its supporters didn’t gather enough signatures.Other election-related questions would expand voter registration options and create a non-partisan election system where the top five candidates of any party advance after a preliminary contest for state-level and Congressional elections.One of the constitutional amendments eyed for 2026 would restore voting rights to Massachusetts citizens incarcerated for felony offenses. That would effectively reverse an amendment voters approved in 2000 that prohibited people from voting while in prison serving felony sentences.Auditing the LegislatureState Auditor Diana DiZoglio and top lawmakers have for months been in a standoff over whether DiZoglio has the authority to audit the Legislature. House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka say it would violate the state Constitution, while DiZoglio maintains that an audit would boost transparency in a body she’s described as a “closed-door operation.”DiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat, last weekrequested AG Campbell’s supportin bringing the matter to court, and now she’s backing that up with a ballot campaign as well. DiZoglio is one of the petitioners on an initiative that would expressly authorize her office to audit the Legislature."

We love to have on local experts and future leaders to celebrate their accomplishments, but what’s especially awesome about this guest is that he’s just 10 years old.Meet Tanoshi Inomata, a fourth grader who just won the Boston spelling bee and will be heading to Washington, D.C., for the national spelling bee in May. Tanoshi and his parents, Hiromi and Chikao, joinedAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath to spell out his victory.Arun Rath:Tanoshi, you must have studied very hard for this. Tell us how you felt when you realized you were the winner.Tanoshi Inomata:I was surprised that I was the big champion because even though I practice a lot every day, I never thought I could. Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn’t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them.Rath:Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi:My championship word was ‘ancho.’Rath:How do you spell that?Tanoshi:You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath:I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi:It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers.Rath:Oh, right! That’s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right? What was your sense of it?Tanoshi:I was pretty confident because even though when I first practiced, I got it wrong. But then I started practicing it and I got it right.Rath:That’s brilliant. Congratulations!Tanoshi:Thank you.Rath:I didn’t realize this, but apparently, only one other person from Massachusetts has won the national spelling bee. That was over 80 years ago. How do you feel about it?Tanoshi:I feel like now I want to win the national spelling bee and show off to everyone.Rath:Are you feeling confident?Tanoshi:Yeah. Now I’m practicing two times a day. I’m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath:Tanoshi, I’m curious, what’s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi:Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath:And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi:Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It’s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he’ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I’m sure I’ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi:Me, too!Rath:It sounds like you have a good time together. That’s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi:I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year.Rath:Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:That’s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.?Tanoshi:Yeah. And I’m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath:So you’ll be heading to Washington in May. Are you going to be practicing every day between now and then?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:Do you have a favorite word to spell?Tanoshi:I like to spell long words. For example, tintinnabulary.Rath:Tintinnabulary has to do with a ringing of bells?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:Can you spell that out for me, if you don’t mind showing off?Tanoshi:T-I-N-T-I-N-N-A-B-U-L-A-R-Y. Tintinnabulary.Rath:Brilliant. We’re so happy that you’re going to nationals and representing us. Good luck! We can’t wait to hear how it goes.Tanoshi:Oh, actually, I have one more thing. We listen to WGBH all the time in our car. It’s because we like the classical music."

Historically, joining a debate team was a privilege restricted to few people, predominantly white males. But more and more speakers of color are joining debate teams in their communities thanks to nonprofit groups likeBoston Debate League.Founded in 2005, Boston Debate League provides students the opportunity to compete in monthly debate competitions.“What’s important to me is that they [students] learn skills that they can transfer to other areas of their lives,” Executive Director Kim Willingham toldBasic Black.On debate teams, students learn essential skills like critical thinking and collaboration, while also fostering self-confidence. For Black and brown students, these spaces can be uniquely important since they are so often told tobe quiet.Dr. Deion Hawkins, assistant professor of argumentation and advocacy and director of debate at Emerson College, has been debating since he was 13 years old. He credits debate with teaching him critical thinking, learning how to ask great questions and thinking on the fly.“The skills that debate teaches are more important than ever, to be able to listen critically to both sides and understand what piece of evidence to use,” said Hawkins.Boston City Councilor At-Large Ruthzee Louijeune agreed it’s important to teach young kids how to debate, pointing to her own experience as an attorney and politician.“A good policy advocate is all about presenting facts in a way that are credible, backing it up with evidence and anticipating what the other side is going to say and incorporating that argument in and doing it in a way that is civil,” said Louijeune.For students of color, debate has historically been harder to access for a litany of reasons. Lynn Yeboah, a student and policy debater at Harvard Debate Council said it was challenging when she first joined the debate team at Harvard four years ago.“I was the only Black woman at the time. I was talking about critical race theory and arguments they weren’t talking about,” said Yeboah. “Now the Harvard team is a predominantly Black team.”Watch the latest episode of Basic Black Fridays at 7:30 p.m. on GBH 2 or live ongbh.org.

Eddie also studies French, and exercises daily.Eddie has been living in the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield, Massachusetts, since before the pandemic. His sentence is up in about two years, For privacy reasons, he asked that we not use his last name.A large part of his day is spent in a shared cell with a bunk bed, desk, toilet and sink. Many of the courses he takes are virtual, and being allowed to use a tablet in this jail is not automatic. It's an earned privilege.Once a week, in person, Eddie takes guitar lessons.“It gives me something to do,” he said. “And on top of that, music is something that helps a person. They say it enhances our mental capacity and ability.”Eddie is part of an intermediate group lesson and in the past few weeks has focused on the minor pentatonic scales. James — who also asked to keep his identity private — is using a Fender guitar someone donated to the program.""I had been dabbling with a guitar for like probably three years, but it wasn't structured,” James said.That was before getting arrested. James has been at the Franklin County Jail for a year and a half, awaiting sentencing. Playing guitar, he said, helps him keep his mind off things.“I think definitely understanding myself and playing guitar go hand in hand,” James said.He wouldn’t talk about why he was arrested. Neither would Eddie.It’s a topic their guitar teacherMichael Nix, a professional musician, never asks about.“It’s a personal thing they can share with me if they want,” Nix said, “but I really don't care.”What Nix does care about, like any music teacher, is that his students practice and learn. But given the setting, Nix said, it's more than that.“What I care about is forming positive relationships, where as a mentor I can ask people to operate at the same kind of high level that I ask myself to operate at [as a musician],"" Nix said.Nix started teaching guitar at the Franklin County Jail in the months before the pandemic shut down in-person activities. Now he meets with about a dozen students — some are long-term, he said, and some he sees once and they don't return. He doesn't always find out why.Guitar lessons are offered only to people who are locked up in aparticular unit of the Franklin County Jail.To be able to stay in the unit, James said you have to step up, volunteer and go to regular community meetings.""We’re held to a higher standard,” he said. ”We gotta do well.”Even with incentives like more free time or extra Netflix, James said not everyone takes advantage of the different courses — or the therapy.Rehabilitation not punishmentFranklin County Sheriff Christopher Donelan said the crimes that bring people to his jail come out of childhood trauma and mental health issues. In the last decade, the opioid epidemic has pushed law enforcement to look at what it means to jail someone with addiction.""The science tells us that addiction is a disease,” Donelan said. “And we're failing ourselves if we think that we can just contain men and women with substance abuse issues in a jail, and then release them and think that anything's going to change or improve.”Not everyone in the U.S. corrections system agrees that men and women convicted of a crime should be able to participate in music lessons or art classes, but Donelan said he thinks most victims of crime are satisfied with the fact that the perpetrator is behind bars.""The bottom line is, as I tell [employees], it's not our job to punish. That's the judge's job,"" Donelan said. ""The judge sends them to us. Our job is to correct behavior and offer opportunities for a better life of not committing crimes.""Researchers have found a correlationbetween making art in U.S. jails and prisons and social skill development and improved mental health. For people who are incarcerated, corrections officials say that translates to learning how to work out the kinks in social settings — with family and employers, and to longevity in the workplace or staying with their therapy or drug treatment.This progressive approach is used at county jails around Massachusetts, Donelan said. Data from Franklin County, he said, show some promising results.""There was a 27% reduction in recidivism over a three-year cohort from 2015 to 2018,"" Donelan said, looking at the jail's first cohort in its cognitive behavioral therapy program.'Changing lives, one guitar at a time'“Corrections professionals realize that there's a lot of bang for your buck with these programs,” saidWayne Kramer, the founder of theproto-punk band MC5.“If they don't do something to help people change for the better, the prison experience itself will change them for the worse,” Kramer said.Kramer speaks from experience. He was arrested in 1975 for selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent. While he was incarcerated in Kentucky, The Clash wrote a song about Kramer and a few other musicians in their B-side single ""Jail Guitar Doors."" Kramer is mentioned in the first verse.""Let me tell you 'bout Wayne and his deals of cocaineA little more every dayHolding for a friend till the band do wellThen the D.E.A. locked him away...""Twenty or so years after Kramer was released, he and British singer-songwriterBilly Braggused the song title for starting two organizations — one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., — that get musical instruments into the hands of incarcerated men and women.Kramer's organization, with the motto ""saving lives one guitar at a time,"" is being used in jails and state prisons in California, Arizona, Texas and other states.""We've participated in longitudinal studies where we have empirical evidence that people that participate in arts-in-corrections programing have lower recidivism rates,"" Kramer said.In Los Angeles County Men's Jail, Kramer himself teachessongwriting workshops.""What they learn right away is how to collaborate with someone that they might not normally hang out with,"" Kramer said. ""They might not be from their neighborhood or might not have the same skin color [or] they might speak Spanish.""What inevitably happens, Kramer said, is they find out they have much more in common than different. He's witnessed remarkable connections made between incarcerated men from from rival gangs, Kramer said, because they're playing and writing music together.“I've had guys tell me, ‘Wayne, you know that dude? I never liked him. I'd see him on the yard. I don't like him. But, you know, we worked on that song together and he's all right,’” Kramer said.'They all end up sleeping'At the Franklin County Jail, Eddie and others are allowed to keep their guitars with him, even after class.He’s been battling depression for years, he said, and playing helps him. There’s one song he recently learned that soothes him.“Like, I close my eyes, I'm out in the zone somewhere and it just relaxes me almost as a mother, singing to a child,” Eddie said.The song is a lullaby written by Sting, but Eddie first heard it at the end of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.""Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here it's safe, here it's warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.Eddie plays it over and over, he said. He's good enough that no one asks him to stop. It may even be soothing to others who hear him.""The last two or three cell mates that I had, basically I play guitar while they're in there,"" Eddie said. ""And because they're in there, I usually kind of play soft. And strangely, they all end up sleeping where I'm playing.""Nix, the guitar teacher, said when people make music together, it's one of the most healthy social interactions. And being able to learn a piece, he said, is a big self-esteem boost — something that could help them live a better life, once they're out of jail."

This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel:So, Daniel, in two days, I am going to be part of a jury, potentially part of a jury. I have to report for jury duty, which is something I've actually never had to do in my whole life.Daniel Medwed:Is this congratulations or condolences?Siegel:Yeah, I think more condolences in my case. I'm not actually super excited to potentially be doing jury duty.Medwed:To fulfill your civic duty, Jeremy.Siegel:Well, that's true. I guess I will be fulfilling my civic duty as an American citizen. So tell me a little bit about how that became a thing. Why is it a thing that I have to do jury duties? What's the background and the history of how this became a thing in America?Medwed:Sure. Like so many aspects of our legal system, we inherited it from Ye Olde England, and the first juries in England date back to the Middle Ages. They were called juries of recognition, and they were used in land disputes. Members of the community would come forward to recognize, from memory, who had received title to particular parcels of land from William the Conqueror. That's sort of the origin. And then by the 1400s, it evolved, and it looked a little bit like it looks today, where juries serve as finders of fact. They collect evidence, they evaluate the evidence, they weigh the credibility of witnesses, and ultimately render a verdict. So the right to a jury trial now in the United States is enshrined in our Constitution. For criminal cases, it's in the Sixth Amendment and for civil cases, where a certain amount of money is at stake, it's in the Seventh Amendment.Siegel:So I'm hearing that I have England and William the Conqueror to thank for my jury duty.Medwed:Exactly. It's a straight throughline from William the Conqueror to Jeremy Siegel.Siegel:So I know that juries aren't the case for every criminal situation. Someone can waive their right to a jury and try their luck before a judge too, right? Why would that be the case?Medwed:On the one hand, the rule of the road essentially is: If you're in a criminal case in particular, and the facts are really gory, really gruesome, a defendant might opt for a judge — it's called a bench trial — instead of a jury, based on the idea that the judge has sort of seen it all and won't be swayed by the gruesome, gory details of the case; can be more objective and dispassionate; and dispense justice in a way that might be more measured than a jury, that could be inflamed by these facts. On the other hand, that calculus differs depending on the orientation of the judge. If the judge is really punitive, really tough on crime, it might be a very different equation. And you might want to go with a jury even in a case with bad facts, because all you have to do is get one juror on your side to vote to acquit. Then you can hang the jury and get a mistrial.Siegel:Okay. So that was actually going to be the next thing that I asked about here: in order to be convicted of something, or to be acquitted, you need everybody in the jury to be on the same page?Medwed:Yes. This idea of jury unanimity in criminal cases is an interesting one. And actually the Supreme Court only resolved it definitively relatively recently, in a 2020 case called Ramos. So here's the background: In Ye Olde England, common law unanimity was the norm. You had to have unanimous juries in criminal cases. And there's an instance of one of these from like 1367. And this idea of unanimity crossed the pond, and it's a part of federal law and virtually every state law. However — and this is what sort of interesting — there is nothing in the Constitution explicitly that talked about unanimous juries in criminal cases. So Louisiana and Oregon were outliers for a long time, and they allowed people to be convicted based on votes that are 10-to-2 or 11-to-1 in favor of conviction. They both backtracked.Those states have backtracked from that in part because the Supreme Court, in that 2020 case I mentioned, finally said, hey, you know what, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under our federal Constitution implicitly carries a requirement that the jury verdict be unanimous. And therefore, we should have unanimous juries in the states as well. That hasn't stopped Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis from making waves about going back to non-unanimous juries. But I think as a matter of constitutional law, it seems like unanimous juries are here to stay in the criminal case context, at least.Siegel:So, Daniel, as you were talking about people coming to a consensus, everybody agreeing on something in order for there to be an acquittal or a conviction, it made me think about how difficult that could be for a bunch of ordinary citizens performing their civic duty, and all of the debate that happens behind closed doors between jurors. I guess I'm curious about why someone who gets caught up in the criminal justice system for one reason or another and ends up in a jury trial — why should we trust the system, at the end of the day?Medwed:I'm not so sure we do. So here's the theory is this, and then we'll talk about the practice. The theory is that you bring 12 fair and impartial citizens who represent a cross-section of the community harmed by the crime, usually within the county, the jurisdiction. If you bring them all together, they'll bring their disparate experiences to the fore, and through a full and frank conversation in the deliberation room, without outside influence, without outside supervision, they'll arrive at a just outcome. That's sort of the theory. You get 12 different people from our very diverse country, bring them all together in a room to talk about facts, and essentially a good result will occur.But the practice is much uglier than that, right? Because there are a lot of tools in the tool chest of prosecutors in particular to shape the jury in a particular way. There's a very sordid history in the United States of prosecutors using what are called peremptory challenges — you can challenge jurors for no articulable reason in criminal cases — that they were challenged based on racial bias. For instance, in a case involving a Black defendant, prosecutors would often try to craft all-white juries. There have been Supreme Court cases that have said you can't do this, but there are a lot of pernicious activities that could be done. Also, another reality of this, of course, is that 12 people in a room won't necessarily all have their voices heard and respected equally. There might be one person who dominates the conversation. It's sort of unclear what the dynamics of the deliberation room might be. So I'm actually pretty skeptical about whether juries work or not.Siegel:So real quick, Daniel, before I let you go, let's say someone, after having this conversation wasn't too excited about their jury duty coming up in a couple days. And in theory, let's say you wanted to get off of a jury. How would you go about doing that?Medwed:I can't imagine anyone would want to do that. Certainly nobody that I know and talk with at least weekly would ever want to do that. I think, Jeremy, essentially you can be excused what's called for cause, if there is some cause. If you have a conflict of interest, you have a financial stake in the case, you know one of the parties — that's sort of easy. You're going to get bounced for that. If you have a clear time commitment that makes it impossible for you to serve, a judge might actually allow you to leave as well. If you express misgivings about the case, for instance, you say, 'I could never convict somebody. I don't believe in criminal justice. I don't believe in prison.' That might also be a basis for getting a bounced. Unfortunately, Jeremy, being the co-host ofMorning Editionisn't necessarily an excuse because you have Paris who can help out. You are indispensable to us, but, you know, possibly you could have one day off or one week off to do your civic duty."

But to a brain scientist, it's a marvel.""I want people to understand that adolescence is not a disease, that adolescence is an amazing time of development,"" says Beatriz Luna, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh.That development is on display most afternoons at the Shaw Skatepark in Washington, D.C. It's a public site, filled with teens hanging out, taking risks, and learning new skills at a rapid pace.""When you're younger, your mind is more open, and you're more creative, and nothing matters,"" says Leo De Leon, 13. ""So you'll really try anything.""Leo has been skateboarding since he was 10. But getting the nerve to try a skate park for the first time was ""kind of scary,"" he says. ""I fell a lot when I first started. And I got hurt a lot.""Leo also got better — fast. And when he'd mastered one trick, he'd push himself to learn a new one, despite the risks.""I was trying to ollie up something, and then I clipped it and my board went up and it hit me in my mouth,"" he says, ""so now I have this scar.""Leo's also broken his arm and his elbows are a mess. But the payoff is, he can do things now like jump the flight of five stairs on the other side of the park.""I kickflipped that one,"" he says. ""It's on my Instagram.""Seeking new experiencesLeo's swift progress from frightened novice to accomplished skater shows the strengths of an adolescent brain.""It's an incredible brain,"" Luna says. ""It's just perfect for what it needs to do. And what it needs to do is gain experiences.""A child's brain goes through two critical periods of very rapid change.The first happens about age two, when most toddlers are busy walking, talking, climbing, and falling. The second critical period begins around puberty.""Adolescence is a time when the brain says, 'alright, you've had a lot of time now, we have to start making some decisions,'"" Luna saysDecisions like which connections to get rid of.""You're born with an excess of synaptic connections,"" Luna says. ""And based on experience, you keep what you use and you lose what you don't use.""It's a process known as synaptic pruning. And its imminent arrival may be one reason an adolescent brain seeks out new experiences, even if it means risking a broken arm or a broken heart.During this period the brain is also optimizing the wiring it decides to keep.""The connections that remain become myelinated,"" Luna says. ""That means they're insulated with fatty tissue, which not only speeds neuronal transmission, but protects from any further changes.""Sex differences in the brain and in behaviorAdolescent brain changes tend to start earlier in girls than in boys. And around this time, males and females also begin to react differently to certain experiences — like stress.That was one finding of an analysis of research on teens asked to perform tasks like solving an impossible math problem, or giving a talk to a group of strangers.""Males' blood pressure was higher than females,"" Luna says. But when participants were asked about the experience later, males said, ""oh it was fine,"" while females described it as ""extremely stressful.""Luna says that suggests there are some sex differences in certain brain circuits. But it's not clear whether those differences are the result of genetics, hormones, or social and cultural influences, she says.Regardless, sex differences are just a small part of the big changes sweeping through the brain during adolescence. And those changes continue throughout the teens and beyond.""A lot of times people will think, oh, too late, they're adolescents,"" Luna says. ""But no, because even though it is a time of vulnerabilities, it is also a window opportunity.""Adolescence, chimp styleAdolescence isn't just for humans. It's also present in chimpanzees.""There's something really charming about the chimps when they're going through this adolescent period,"" says Alexandra Rosati, an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at the University of Michigan. ""They look kind of gangly. They have these new big teeth in their mouth.""And, of course, they are experiencing puberty.""They're going through this physical change in the body and those same hormones are resculpting the brain, basically, during this period,"" Rosati says.Part of this resculpting involves the willingness to take risks.Rosati was part of a team that did a gambling experiment with 40 chimps of various ages at a sanctuary in the Republic of Congo.The chimps had a choice. They could go for a sure thing: peanuts. Or they could select a mystery option that might be a boring cucumber or a delicious banana.""Adolescent chimpanzees were more willing to make that gamble,"" Rosati says. ""They were more likely to choose that risky option and hopefully get the banana, whereas adults were more likely to play it safe.""That suggests young humans and chimps are both predisposed to risky behavior.""The fact that we see these shifts in risk taking in the chimps suggests that this is tracking something biological,"" Rosati says. ""It's not something to do with human culture or the way children are exposed to the media or something.""For both species, Rosati says, there's a purpose to this kind of risk-taking. ""This period of adolescent risk-taking lets children grow into adults who are learning to live independently,"" she says.Risky business and dopamineSo how does the brain of an adolescent chimp or a human encourage risk-taking? With dopamine, a naturally occurring chemical involved in memory, motivation, and reward.Adolescent brains produce more dopamine and are more sensitive to the chemical than adult brains, says Adriana Galván, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles.That means a bigger payoff from positive experiences like eating a piece of chocolate, or just hanging out with friends.""It's a feedback loop,"" she says, ""because then you start thinking, well, that was pretty good. I'm going to get that to happen again.""This amped up reward system also helps young brains learn faster by pushing boundaries and constantly asking, ""What happens when I do this?"" Galván says, ""because that is how we learn best.""But big rewards and fast learning can make the adolescent brain vulnerable to some behaviors that are damaging, rather than useful.""If the behavior is doing drugs, the brain is saying, 'oh okay, this is what I should be paying attention to and devoting my neurons and my pathways to,'"" Galván says. ""So you strengthen that. And eventually that is how addiction happens.""The brain's vulnerability during adolescence is probably one reason so many adult smokers picked up the habit as teens, Galván says.Over the course of adolescence, though the brain's priorities change, she says.

The city says the clearing marks the end of a period of leniency offered during the winter months, in response to rising issues with crime and sanitation within the tents. But many displaced people living in the area say they don't know where else to go.Workers employed by the neighborhood’s business improvement association helped break down a tent belonging to an unhoused woman who identified herself as Alex, who protested the clearing while pulling tent poles from her former home.“You don’t have to leave, you just can’t bring back a tent,” a worker in a yellow vest said.“There was supposed to be housing,” Alex said, breaking down her tent from the inside. “Now we’re just going to be sleeping in the rain.”The trash, needles, garbage and human waste that accumulate in the streets along Mass. and Cass could be prevented with better sanitation, Alex says.“They have better ways to help us keep clean, like more trash barrels and public bathrooms,” she told GBH News. “There’s trash everywhere because they don’t want to provide what we need, and now they want us to just take down our tents and figure out a way to survive.”Alex interrupted her thought to run over to a man overdosing on the sidewalk. She offered nasal naloxone — a medication used to reverse opioid overdose — from her backpack as multiple Boston police officers, Boston Public Health Commission workers and an emergency harm reduction worker from Boston Healthcare for the Homeless rushed in to bring the man back to consciousness.“He’ll be OK,” Alex said, unphased as she continued her thought. “Basically, homeless people are being made to suffer because the police want to make arrests. Those who have warrants will probably clear the area, and the rest of us will just sleep out in the rain.”Among those who dismantled their encampments Monday was Tara, a woman in her mid-thirties who has lived on Mass. and Cass for the past year.“I don’t think we’re going to be gone for long,” Tara said as she shoved a blanket, a book and two shampoo bottles into a milk crate near her tent. “It’s disgusting how much money is wasted doing this, but think of how much money they look to lose having us gone? I mean, people are employed because we’re here.""Enforcing the zero-tolerance encampment protocol is a return to a policy implemented by Mayor Michelle Wu back in January 2022, following acity-sanctioned sweepof more than 200 tents in the area. Nearly 600 people have passed through six new temporary housing sites since that sweep,according to city data, and 110 people have been placed in permanent housing.Unhoused individuals who were asked to remove their encampments Monday were offered “free shelter, substance use treatment, relocation and storage options,” according to a statement from a Wu spokesperson, while “an enhanced case management team is connecting with every individual in the area and developing individualized service plans.”The city also launcheda new protocolfor people hoping to connect with their lost or missing loved ones in the area by locating friends or family members, obtaining consent and facilitating communication.Returning home is not an option for John, who says he has lived near Mass. and Cass for roughly two years and struggled to find a better housing option. John’s immediate plan is to find a bed in a shelter, though waitlists for services remain long.“It seems like some people benefitted for certain reasons and others didn’t,” he said. “I don’t really know why.”Some longtime occupants of the encampments are still struggling to find resources. Among them, Mercedes says she has been living in the area for nearly four years and remains on a waitlist for transitional housing.“I see new people coming here all the time, and some get help, but people that have been out here longer than me still aren’t getting help,” Mercedes said. “It doesn’t make any sense. We don't know where to go.”Newmarket Business Association Executive Director Sue Sullivan, who runs a program to employ people struggling with homelessness or substance use at Mass. and Cass, moved from tent to tent Monday with her team of employees in yellow vests to clear the street, moving garbage into trash bins and taking down tents.“Most of our guys were living in these tents a year and a half ago,” Sullivan said, “and now it’s taking us forever to get them to better places.”New people arrive in the area on a regular basis, Sullivan said, seeking treatment at methadone clinics or detox programs in the area.“There are no less than 30 people out here every day helping people get into housing, as much as housing is available,” she said. But when it comes to building new housing, she said nobody seems to want facilities in their own neighborhoods.“No one wants transitional housing or treatment centers anywhere, and yet all these people are waiting for that. Every day, someone asks me why there isn’t more housing,” Sullivan said. “I’m not a housing person, but I share that frustration. I don’t know the answer, but I know there’s got to be a way.”The city “promised housing, but they don’t have any money for it,” said Laquan, who packed up the tent he shares with his partner Sophie. The couple might spend their nights in a shelter, or “another street corner in a tent somewhere else in the city,” he said, packing his clothes and blankets into four plastic bins provided by the city, with the guarantee of 90 days of safekeeping.“They have the money to store my stuff, just not me,” Laquan said. “They don’t want to put me in a house or an apartment, because it takes months, years, decades … but wherever they put me, that’s where I reside. That’s my home.”"

At a commuter rail station one May morning, the Chelsea community development director points down the block to a housing complex with hundreds of apartments with granite kitchen counters and stainless steel appliances fetching over $2,500 in monthly rent — expensive for the historically working class city.“Over the last ten years, there's been about three times the amount of luxury housing built compared to affordable housing,” he said.Train’s goal is to reverse that trend in Chelsea and build more mixed-income housing complexes to ensure there are affordable apartments for current residents to stay in the area. But in other Massachusetts towns and cities, officials say more expensive housing is exactly what they need to revitalize their downtowns and boost their local economies.“We need folks to come into Fitchburg that have higher incomes,” said Liz Murphy, the Central Massachusetts city’s community development director. “We struggle to have those higher-end units for [them].”Fitchburg and Chelsea’s conflicting priorities illustrate the complex challenges state officials face as they search for solutions to a housing shortage that has caused prices to surge andpeople to relocate to other states. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to development.This has prompted Gov. Maura Healey’s administration to stress that Massachusetts needs all types of housing — both affordable and market rate. Officials are trying to tailor policy and state financing for housing development to meet communities’ different needs.Still, housing advocates caution that with state housing resources finite, using a higher percentage of taxpayer money to incentivize the development of apartments and homes for wealthier people raises equity concernswhen that funding could instead go toward rental assistance and more housing for lower-income residents.There’s also the risk that any additional construction of high-end housing fuels a runaway train of increasing home prices in more Massachusetts cities.Different cities. Different housing markets.“Location, location, location” is a phrase real estate insiders use often, and it helps explain why communities’ housing needs can be so conflicting.Boston’s housing market has had a radiating impact on nearby cities for years. As housing prices in the state’s largest city continue to increase, renters have increasingly flocked to nearby communities like Chelsea, where apartments have historically been less expensive. Developers have followed, building new apartment complexes and raising rent to meet the growing demand.The increasingly hot housing market in Chelsea squeezes out the lower-income people that have traditionally made the city a working-class community. Median rents and homelessness in Chelsea are at record highs, and city officials say over half of renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on housing and utilities.A similar dynamic is playing out in cities like Lynn, Somerville and Worcester, where longtime residents are increasingly moving out because they can no longer afford housing.Worcester native Mallory Shelly, whose mother, sister and brother have all left the city in search of less expensive housing, said the influx of higher-end development feels invasive.“The rich people are taking over,” Shelly said as she walked around the city’s downtown and Canal District, where thousands of high-priced luxury housing units have been built in recent years. “It feels like a parasite.”By comparison, smaller post-industrial cities that are farther away from Boston haven’t experienced these same forces. Once factories shut down in the 1900s, Fitchburg and Holyoke became economically depressed as businesses closed and people moved away.Today, both cities have begun to rebound, but they still have vacant properties and office space that can be converted into housing. Liz Murphy, Fitchburg’s community development director, said although her city can use more affordable apartments, there’s already a concentration of them around downtown. She wants to see new housing in that area for people with higher incomes who are moving into Fitchburg.“[Those families] support our economy, and our local economy provides local jobs to folks that are already in the community,” Murphy said.Complications due to the distinct housing needsRecent disagreement over an obscure state housing financing program exemplifies the challenges that come with trying to tailor state policy to meet cities’ distinct needs.Massachusetts’ 26 post-industrialGateway Citiesare eligible for housing construction funding via the Housing Development Incentive Program. The program provides tax incentives to developers who build market-rate units.When developers build housing, they usually take out loans for construction and repay the debt with future rental income. But average rents in some Gateway Cities tend to be lower, which squeezes developers’ profits, leaving them less willing to take on certain projects. The HDIP subsidy is meant to make up for that and fuel more investment in Gateway Cities.In an effort to boost housing production, Healey has proposed expanding the HDIP program by lifting its $10 million annual cap to $57 million in the first year and $30 million in subsequent years. The proposal, which state lawmakers are still considering, has set off a statewide debate over whether the HDIP program should be altered to also finance affordable housing development.Leaders of most Gateway Citiesand some developers reject any type of modification that would force HDIP projects to include affordable apartments, arguing that it could stifle housing production because income-restricted units are often more expensive to finance.“If you think there’s a public good to having 26 thriving downtowns across the commonwealth — and not just Boston, Cambridge and Somerville — then HDIP’s a very modest investment to make that happen,” said Andre Leroux, a director with the nonpartisan think tank MassINC.But Alexander Train, the development director for Chelsea, believes the HDIP program does need to be reformed. Without the affordability modification, he said HDIP does nothing to help Gateway Cities like Chelsea, and the state as a whole, address the dearth of income-restricted apartments.Train and Judith Liben, a housing attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, noted that HDIP often subsidizes the development of luxury apartments — in some cases, HDIP-financed apartments rent for more than $4,500 a month.Train noted that when HDIP buildings come online and charge higher rents in a city, landlords of nearby existing apartments raise their rents in response.“Worcester is the poster child,” Liben said, noting that Massachusetts’ second-largest city has become a primary recipient of HDIP funds after struggling to attract development for years. “It’s not just Worcester, but Worcester is extreme.”Worcester officials have agreed housing prices are rising, and say they’retaking stepsto create more affordable housing.Still, housing advocates add that using state money to facilitate the construction of market-rate homes is inherently inequitable. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition,Massachusetts needs more than 175,000 housing unitsfor its lowest-income residents. Activists and some local officials argue that when the state subsidizes market-rate housing development for wealthier people, there’s less funding available to help build more affordable housing.“We simply cannot afford to spend $30 million of our annual State housing dollars, equal to one-fifth of the current year’s housing capital budget, on market-rate housing,” Worcester City Councilor Etel Hawhiajtweetedearlier in June.In an interview, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll acknowledged the concerns about building more market-rate housing. She said the state already allocates hundreds of millions dollars annually to support more affordable housing development and rental assistance.Still, in order to best meet communities’ different housing needs and address Massachusetts’ housing crisis, Driscoll said the state must find a right balance between the construction of more market-rate and affordable housing.“We don't have enough housing to meet the demand,” she said. “That is requiring us to really be a lot more thoughtful about the strategies we can put in place in all of our communities to build the type of housing we need.”"

A large portion of the discussion onBoston Public Radiofocused onthe plan to movethe O'Bryant School of Math and Science out of its current home in Roxbury, where it neighbors the Madison Park Vocational Technical School, and into the West Roxbury Educational Complex.“My perception is that there wasn't a lot of transparency in that decision to move,” said caller Donna from Charlestown. “I also am wondering if you might be able to share the rationale.”The plan was first announced to the public in a press conference this June. This came after analysis from school leaders and people involved in the historical development of the school district, Wu said. “There was significant vetting that had to be done about whether this was even a proposal we should consider,” she said.“The bottom line is this: we have two high schools who are battling for space,” said Wu. “The Madison Park Vocational Technical High School and the O'Bryant Math and Science Academy have been jammed into the same complex for multiple decades now.”A few decades ago, Wu explained, there was a movement to create smaller schools with separate K-8 and 9-12 models. Larger high schools were broken down into multiple, smaller schools in the same building or nearby, Wu said. Since that time, enrollment and demographic shifts have the school district moving towards a seventh through twelfth grade model to accommodate growing enrollment in some places.O’Bryant and Madison Park currently share athletic and academic space. The close proximity has limited the STEM offerings at O’Bryant and limited vocational tracks and adult education at Madison Park, Wu said.“Giving each school its own space is really important to tapping into the potential of all of our students,” she said.Additionally, moving would allow O’Bryant to expand its seventh and eighth grade classes, which are currently capped due to space constraints. Wu said there’s benefit to having students join O’Bryant before ninth grade because it lets them acclimate to school culture and form friendships they can carry through high school.Boston Public Radiohost Jim Braude asked Wu about the perceptions of moving O’Bryant from a community of color to a primarily white community. Particularly when the MBTA is already struggling with slow zones and access.Wu explained that the exam school admissions process guarantees that every school is already open to students city-wide, from every neighborhood and all socioeconomic backgrounds. The city will also provide dedicated shuttles to West Roxbury. For students coming from East Boston, Wu said the commute “would be the same or even faster than what the students have to do on the T right now.”Wu said the greatest disparities in access and quality of education and instruction in Boston occur after elementary school. “There's a perception and a feeling that you have to walk a very narrow tightrope to get into the right sort of small mix of schools,” she said. But adjusting the lottery system is not the answer — instead, Wu said “every single one of our high school seats has to be a high quality option.”"

Funding for the study will come from the federal pandemic relief money.Cities generally use disparity studies to provide legal justification for implementing what effectively serve as affirmative action programs for companies, such as government contracts reserved specifically for businesses that the study found were not getting their fair share of city work.In 2021, Boston releaseda disparity study showingthat 0.4% of prime contracts the city awarded to private enterprises over a five-year period went to Black-owned businesses.In response, Mayor Michelle Wu launcheda “sheltered market” program— the first of its kind in the state — reserving certain contracts for women- or minority-owned businesses. In the first three months of that program, the city steered more than $700,000 to two minority-owned firms for cleaning and event management services.Somerville and Brooklineissued a joint requestWednesday for a contractor to conduct a disparity study for the two municipalities that will, among other things, “Determine whether a legally defensible basis exists for establishing a race and/or gender conscious contracting program … and the appropriate and most effective parameters of such a program.”Angela Allen, Somerville’s chief procurement officer, said the city is already trying to recruit more minority- and women-owned firms to bid for city contracts, but they often get “far fewer offers than we expect we will.” The real goal to the disparity research is “to lower the barriers to entry to bid on projects,” she said. “A study will help get us a framework and a roadmap to how we go about this.”And she said it made sense to work with Brookline on the project, and to split the costs. “We feel we're like-minded communities. Our administrations are very much in support of this project, so why not do it together?”“We really decided early on is how can we attack this together,” said David Geanakakis, chief procurement officer for the town of Brookline. “There will be separate outcomes distinct to Brookline, distinct to Somerville, but there is enough of a commonality in the whole study process.”And since the two communities mostly have the same purchasing needs and the same pool of potential vendors, it allows them to seek solutions that are applicable to both of them — and, Geanakakis said, to a broader swath of Greater Boston as well.Brookline and Somerville have briefed other local communities on the research plan, he said, and promised to share results and recommendations that could be useful without each municipality having to do its own study. “We really were driven in both of the communities here to do this and frankly, take the lead,"" he said.Luis Quizhpe, Somerville’s strategic planning and equity manager, noted that the project also extends beyond women and people of color to include all “socially disadvantaged individuals.”That language “really kind of broadens how we think of someone who we're trying to help equitably,” he said, because it focuses on who might be facing structural barriers to their success, rather than focusing on categories and descriptions — like “minority” — that essentially define people by how they are disempowered.“I think that that language, albeit small … gives back a sense of self-determination or at least the intent of self-determination,” Quizhpe said."

The practice is growing in popularity among organizations, niche communities and within friend groups.""I think sometimes when people think about sustainability, they equate the word with sacrifice,"" Fixsen said. ""But activities like a clothing swap are a way to remind folks that sustainability is about solutions.""As sustainability becomes an increasingly important factor in the clothing industry, the rise in thrifting and swapping is a promising start to reducing our carbon footprint.

Now, after ten years, she is running the race saying “That’s weight that I don’t want to carry around anymore.” At the Boylston Street finish line where Blackburn was injured, now there are four twisted spires of bronzed metal reaching skyward. They stand sentry in a moving memorial to those who lost their lives in an instant. A remembrance and a reminder of our pledge never to forget.But somecan’tforget — emotionally and mentally, time stopped for them. Many don’t show any signs of physical injury but carry invisible scars: the trauma they still live with. Listening to their stories of being haunted by the memories in 2013 prompted Massachusetts Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to introduce the Post Disaster Mental Health Response Act which President Biden signed into law. It will extend federal aid to victims suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In announcing the proposed bill, Pressley urged support for these often-overlooked marathon bombing victims, saying the next pandemic will be widespread and untreated trauma.I’ve been looking back on my observations on the Marathon bombing anniversaries. On the first, I noted the ongoing grief that still felt fresh. On the third anniversary, I wondered if we had gone through the documented stages of grief — denial/anxiety/bargaining/anger/despair/hope — so that the Marathon had moved out of the shadow of the bombing. And now I wonder if time will ever dull the sharp edges of the anniversaries to come.Grief expert Elizabeth Kubler Ross says simply, “the reality is that you will grieve forever.” In her co-authored book, “On Grief and Grieving” she adds, “You will be whole again … but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same nor would you want to.” The next ten years start now."

The event, hosted by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, launched the group’s ‘Face Jewish Hate’ campaign in collaboration with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism.Robert Kraft, the 81-year-old founder of the foundation and owner of the New England Patriots, told the crowd that the America he sees today reflects Germany in the late 1930s.“We’re seeing neo-Nazis raising swastikas and demonstrating, saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and ‘down with the Jews,’” Kraft said. “This is the United States of America in 2023. There’s no room for that kind of hate — or hate of any kind.”The campaign features afive-point plan: Face Jewish hate, empower the community, build allyship, inform and educate the next generation and strengthen communal security. Those steps were determined by a task force of community leaders and experts on combating antisemitism with antisemitic incidents on the rise.According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were over3,600 reported antisemitic incidentsacross the country in 2022 — the highest number on record since the ADL began tracking the incidents more than 40 years ago. In Massachusetts, antisemitic incidentsjumped 41%from 2021 to 2022.Along with top elected officials like Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Attorney General Andrea Campbell, local Jewish leaders like Kraft addressed the crowd. Speakers stood in front of screens that shared stories of local antisemitic hate crimes, like that ofRabbi Shlomo Noginski, who was stabbed eight times last summer in Brighton outside of a Jewish school. Noginski attended the event but did not address the crowd.Dr. Jeremy Schiller, who, during his tenure as the Chair of the Salem Board of Health during the COVID-19 pandemic, received severalantisemitic messages and threatsfrom people who opposed vaccination and mitigation efforts.He said that, on top of his outrage and indignation, he also felt a growing sense of loneliness and isolation from the lack of attention to antisemitic hate during the pandemic.“If [antisemitism] is not called out, if our communities stay silent, then we enter into that same dangerous debate,” he said. “That’s sending me a yellow star or depicting me with a noose around my neck to my kids, or equating COVID mitigation measures ... to Nuremberg laws.”Members of other faiths also spoke on the resurgence of antisemitism locally and nationally. Cardinal Sean Patrick O’Malley, who serves as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, said he was stunned to hear Jewish leaders’ testimony at a joint Catholic and Jewish community event about the measures Jewish folks must take to practice their faith safely.“I was horrified to hear about how they have to have their services with doors locked in all kinds of security and cameras and armed guards,” he said. “Racism and antisemitism have always been the original sins of our country, and we must never let our guard down.”Correction: This story was updated to correct the misspelling of Rabbi Shlomo Noginski's name."

So, looking at my schedule, we could probably come out for 12:30, 1 o’clock.”This kind of mobile response is one of the services offered here and at 24 othercommunity behavioral health centersor CBHCs that opened across Massachusetts in January. It’s a new statewide experiment in addressing mental health and addiction issues by funding a comprehensive range of services for patients. For now, though, insurance coverage issues prevent roughly three-quarters of patients from accessing much of the care these new centers provide.'A whole new model of care'In addition to mobile response services like the team Buckley dispatched to do an evaluation, another service CBHCs provide is essentially a walk-in urgent care center for mental health and substance use disorders. They also offer overnight beds for patients who need that level of support and observation.""What we've basically done is construct a whole new model of care,"" said Riverside President Vicker DiGravio. The way the state set up this new system allows for care from a whole team, he said.“Teams with expertise in substance use disorders, co-occurring disorders, mental health issues, teams that specialize in serving children and adolescents,” DiGravio said. “And the team involves a clinician and includes a care coordinator. It includes a peer specialist or a family partner.""The state also required CBHCs to have phlebotomy labs on site to test for drugs, make sure medication levels are OK, and other analysis.A directory of community behavioral health centers in Massachusetts is onlinehere.A boost of state funds and a new style of billingThe launch of this system was one of the last big initiatives celebrated by former Gov. Charlie Baker — perhaps the crowning achievement of his administration's so-called Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform.“This is incredibly innovative and it has the potential to be transformative for a variety of reasons,” said Lydia Conley, president and CEO of the Association for Behavioral Healthcare, which represents mental health and addiction treatment centers in Massachusetts, including almost all of the new CBHCs.“It funds behavioral health on a level that it should be,” Conley said. “It is a specialty. It has never been adequately resourced. This model adequately resources it.”The difference, Conley said, isn’t just that the state is paying more to support mental health and addiction treatment. There’s a whole different model for paying for those services.Usually, insurance companies bill for every individual service a patient gets. But for those who are covered for care at a CBHC, there’s just one rate for their combined services.”So if we provide one service, we bill the bundle and we get that rate,” DiGravio explained. “If we provide three or four services in one day, we bill the bundle once and we still get the same rate.”That means patients can get a broader range of services that they didn’t used to have access to, DiGravio said.“Hopefully, we’ll do a better job meeting the needs of the individuals we serve and helping them to avoid accessing higher, more expensive levels of care including emergency departments and inpatient hospitalizations,” he said.A push for private insurers to cover CBHC careWhile care at these centers is covered for about 1.5 million people under MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, roughly three-quarters of insured people in Massachusetts have private insurance or Medicare, neither of which cover these services.A few insurance companies have signed up to cover CHBC care. But most haven't, and they aren't required to.""It doesn't feel comfortable on the service delivery side to have sort of a two-tiered model or be offering care in two different ways when we feel very passionately that that full complement of services is what people need,"" said Kimberly Fisher, vice president of behavioral health services at Riverside.CBHCs won’t turn away anyone in crisis, and a state law requires private insurers to cover immediate care in those kinds of emergencies. Also, private insurers can be billed individually for some of the services at CBHCs. But patients can’t get coverage for recovery coaches, peer specialists, and other services like the in-house lab.The Massachusetts Association of Health Plans says some may be planning to contract with CBHCs, and others may still be evaluating the idea, since the program is in its early stages.DiGravio said he hopes more insurance companies will sign up once they can prove this model has better outcome and is more cost effective. And, he said, employers can play a role.""If employers want their employees to have access to these services, they need to let the health plans they contract with know that this needs to be part of the benefit package,"" DiGravio said.Also, statelegislationhas been filed that would compel insurance companies to cover care at CBHCs.“I'm really hopeful that this legislation and my bill will make these treatment service providers available to everybody in our community, whether you have MassHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield, you name it,” said state Sen. John Cronin, who introduced the bill.That legislation isn’t going to pass overnight, though. Cronin said he’s hoping in the next year or two to get an analysis of the bill from the Center for Health Information Analysis, which should be able to make it more clear which insurance companies the state could require to cover this kind of care."

Staff members at a nearby emergency department found no leakage. But her OB-GYN still wanted to see her as soon as possible.Laskey and her husband, Jacob, made the three-hour trip to the Swedish Maternal & Fetal Specialty Center-First Hill. Laskey had sought the clinic's specialized care for this pregnancy, her second, after a dangerous complication with her first: The placenta had become embedded in the uterine muscles.Back in Seattle, doctors at the clinic found Laskey's water had broken early, posing a serious risk to her and the fetus, and ordered her immediate admission to Swedish Medical Center/First Hill. She delivered her son after seven weeks in the hospital. Though she was treated for multiple postpartum complications, she was well enough to be discharged the next day. Her son, who is healthy, went home a month later.Laskey soon developed a fever and body aches, and she was told by her OB-GYN to go to Swedish's emergency department. She said doctors there wanted to admit her when she arrived Aug. 20 and scheduled a procedure for Aug. 26 to remove a fragment of placenta that her body had not eliminated on its own.Laskey, who had already spent weeks away from her 3-year-old daughter, chose to go home. She returned for the procedure, which went well, and she was home the same day.Then the bills came.The Patient: Danielle Laskey, 31, was covered by a state-sponsored plan offered by her employer, a local school district, and administered by Regence BlueShield.Medical Service: In-patient hospital services for 51 days, plus a one-day stay that included a second placenta removal procedure.Service Provider: Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, part of Providence Health & Services, a large, nonprofit, Catholic health system.Total Bill: Swedish, through Regence, billed about $120,000 in cost sharing for Laskey's initial hospitalization and about $15,000 for her second visit and procedure.What Gives: The specialized clinic caring for Laskey before her hospital admission was in her insurance plan's network. The clinic's doctors admit patients only to Swedish Medical Center, one of the Seattle area's only specialized providers for Laskey's condition — which, given that connection, she assumed was also in the network.So after being urgently admitted to Swedish, Laskey believed her bills would be largely covered, with the couple expected to pay $2,000 at most for their portion of in-network care because of her plan's out-of-pocket cost limit.It turned out Swedish Medical Center was out of network for Laskey's plan and, at first, Regence determined that Laskey's hospitalizations were not emergencies. Jacob said that in November a Regence case manager initially told him that his wife's lengthy hospitalization was an emergency admission and out-of-network charges would not apply. But then he said the case manager called back and said the charges would apply after all, because Danielle had not come in through the emergency department.Both Washington state and federal laws prohibit insurers and providers from billing patients for out-of-network charges in emergency situations. The couple said neither Swedish nor Regence told them before or during the two hospitalizations that Swedish was out of network, and that they never knowingly signed anything agreeing to accept out-of-network charges.Jacob, who works as a psychiatrist at a different hospital, said he mentioned the surprise-billing laws to the Regence case manager, but she replied that the laws did not apply to his family's situation.It was only after Regence was contacted by KHN that the insurer explained its reasoning to the reporter: Regence said the Swedish hospital, while out of network for Danielle, had a broader contract with the insurer as a ""participating provider"" and so the insurer was not in violation of surprise-billing laws by approving Swedish's out-of-network coinsurance charges.The broader contract allowed Swedish to bill members of any Regence plan who receive out-of-network services there 50% coinsurance — the patient's portion of the overall cost the insurer allows the provider to charge — with no out-of-pocket maximum for the patient.What's the difference between a hospital that's ""in network"" and one that's a ""participating provider""? In this case, by contracting with Regence as an out-of-network but also participating provider, Swedish straddled the line between being in and out of network — designations that traditionally indicate whether a provider has a contract with an insurer or not.Setting the terms with an insurer for providing its members emergency or other care appears to allow hospitals to sidestep new surprise-billing laws that prevent out-of-network providers from charging high, unpredictable rates in emergencies, according to government and private-sector medical billing experts.Experts said they had not heard of out-of-network providers evading surprise-billing laws by being contracted as ""participating providers"" until KHN asked about Laskey's case.Ellen Montz, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said that under the federal No Surprises Act, the definition of a ""participating"" emergency facility that's subject to the law's surprise-billing protections depends on whether the facility has a contract with the insurer specifying the terms and conditions under which an emergency service is provided to a plan member.Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy who studies out-of-network billing, said Laskey's case seems to fall into a ""weird"" gray area of the state and federal laws protecting patients from out-of-network charges in emergency situations.If there had been no contract between Regence and Swedish, the laws clearly would have prohibited those charges. But since there was a contract specifying a 50% coinsurance rate when Swedish was out of network for a particular Regence plan, those laws may not apply, Fiedler said.After he declined to apply for the hospital's financial assistance program, Jacob said Swedish also notified them in November that they had two months to pay or be sent to collections.Natalie Kozimor, a spokesperson for Providence Swedish, said the hospital disagreed with ""some of the details and characterizations of events"" presented by the Laskeys, though she did not specify what those were. She said Swedish assisted Danielle with her appeal to Regence.""We had no luck with Swedish taking any role or responsibility with regard to our billing or advocating on our behalf,"" Jacob said. ""They basically just referred us to their financial department to put us on a payment plan.""The Resolution: In December, the couple appealed Regence's approval of Swedish's out-of-network charges for the 51-day hospitalization, claiming it was an emergency and that there was no in-network hospital with the expertise to treat her condition. They also filed a complaint with the state insurance commissioner's office.The office told KHN that the ""participating provider"" contract does not override the laws barring out-of-network charges in emergency situations. ""Danielle had an emergency and Regence acknowledges it was an emergency, so she cannot be balance-billed,"" said Stephanie Marquis, public affairs director for the Washington state Office of the Insurance Commissioner.On Jan. 13, Regence said it would grant the Laskeys' appeal to cover the first hospitalization as an in-network service, erasing the biggest part of Swedish's bill but still leaving the family on the hook for the $15,000 bill for Danielle's second visit and procedure.On Jan. 27, two days after KHN contacted Regence and Swedish about Danielle Laskey's case, a Regence representative called and informed her that her second hospitalization also would be reclassified as an in-network service.Ashley Bach, a Regence spokesperson, confirmed to KHN that both stays now will be covered as emergency, in-network services, eliminating Swedish's coinsurance charges. But in what appears to be contrary to the insurance commissioner's stance, he said the bills had not violated state or federal laws prohibiting out-of-network charges in emergency situations because of the contract with Swedish covering all its plans.""Under the Washington state and federal balance-billing laws, the definitions of whether a provider is considered in network hinges on whether there is a contract with a specific provider,"" Bach said.The Takeaway: More than a year after the federal surprise-billing law took effect, patients can still get hammered by surprise bills resulting from health plans' limited provider networks and ambiguities about what is considered emergency medical care. The loopholes are out there, and patients like Danielle Laskey are just discovering them.Washington state Rep. Marcus Riccelli, chair of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, said he will ask the state's public and private insurers what steps they could take to avoid provider network gaps and out-of-network billing surprises like this. He said he will also review whether there is a loophole in state law that needs to be closed by the legislature.Fiedler said policymakers need to consider addressing what looks like a gap in the new laws protecting consumers from surprise bills, since it's possible that other insurers across the country have similar contracts with hospitals. ""Potentially this is a significant loophole, and it's not what lawmakers were aiming for,"" he said.Congress might have to fix the problem, since the federal agencies that administer the No Surprises Act may not have authority to do anything about it, he added.Bruce Alexander, a CMS spokesperson, said the Departments of Health & Human Services, Labor, and Treasury are looking into this issue. While the agencies can't predict whether a new rule or guidance will be needed to address it, he said, ""they remain committed to protecting consumers from surprise medical bills.""In the meantime, patients, even in emergencies, should ask their doctors before a hospital admission whether the hospital is in their plan network, out of network, or (watch for these words) a ""participating provider.""As the Laskeys discovered, hospital billing departments may offer little help in resolving surprise billing. So, while it is worth contesting questionable charges to the provider, it's also usually an option to quickly appeal to your state insurance department or commissioner.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

I just do the work.”After nearly six decades, Miller says it’s time for someone new to take over his life’s work: the Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspaper. Miller announced Wednesday he is handing the paper over to new owners as part of a larger expansion and redesign of the publication.The new owners, Ron Mitchell and Andre Stark, are veteran journalists with close ties to their Boston communities and long-standing family relationships with 88-year-old Miller, a Roxbury native.“We’re journalists, we’re filmmakers, but we’re also people who have been telling the truth about our community,” Mitchell said. “We’re going to take [The Banner] into the next half a century. We’re going to transition it in many different ways to make it more amenable to a younger audience.”Mitchell, 61, who previously worked at GBH News, resigned last week from a nearly 30-year career at WBZ-TV to prepare for his role as publisher and editor of the Banner, a return to his roots. Mitchell’s family — including his aunt Jean McGuire, a former METCO director — had generations of ties to the Miller family.“We are living up to the responsibility that our families birthed us into,” Mitchell said, “to take responsibility for the communication in our community.”Stark, 63, who will serve as the paper’s chief operating officer, is another GBH veteran who produced documentary films for PBS documentary series Frontline and NOVA. He serves as a board member at the Roxbury-based Center for Teen Empowerment, a nonprofit that provides resources to young people from local communities of color.Stark says he read the Banner as a child, the son of West-Indian parents who steeped him in Black cultural history and enrolled him in school at the Freedom House established by Otto and Muriel Snowden. His mother, a close friend of Miller’s, brought Stark to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s march from his Roxbury neighborhood to the Boston Common in 1965.“I think one of the reasons Mel felt comfortable transferring the mantle over to us is that he knows both of our families,” Stark said. “It helps close the circle as he knows both of us from years ago.”Kenneth Cooper, another GBH News veteran with decades of experience at newsrooms including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Dispatch, will join the Banner as an editorial consultant, overseeing a major expansion and transformation that lies ahead. Longtime Banner senior editor Yawu Miller has agreed to stay on (despite his uncle's departure) to manage the Boston edition of the paper.Financing for the transition came from private contributions from community members around Greater Boston and the Mill Cities Community Investment, a community development financial institution based in Lawrence. Both Miller and the new owners declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.Within the next year, the Banner plans to distribute in other regional markets, including Connecticut, Rhode Island and Northern parts of Massachusetts, and positions will open for bureau chiefs in those areas, Mitchell said. The change of guard comes with plans for a new website and app, weekly 30-minute investigative news shows, wider coverage of sports and local business briefs. The expansion of online content will be overseen by Colin Redd, a 30-year-old Boston native who helps run Blavity, a Black-owned media company with an understanding of young audiences.The new website will include community services including access to loan applications, scholarships, a calendar of community events and other educational resources, Mitchell said.“It’s going to be an interactive resource, a portal of opportunities,” Mitchell said. “The website will be true community outreach, not just a physical rendition of the paper.”The goal, Mitchell says, is to reach new audiences and expand coverage while preserving the publication’s integrity as a source of local news for communities of color.“This is an extension of African-American culture going back hundreds of years, community storytelling that transformed into Black publishing,” Mitchell said. “Dating back to emancipation, Black papers told the truth about the Black community.”The Banner has always stood out as a source of straightforward information, Mitchell says, representing an on-the-ground approach to issues directly impacting communities of color.“The Black community is not a monolith,” he said. “That's why it is important to have a paper that understands the complexity of our community and tells us that's the only way you get the true story.”Miller founded the Banner in 1965 to fill a void left by the folding of The Guardian, a newspaper led by civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter. His goal was never objectivity — an idea he dismisses as “nonsense” — but to be fair and honest, and to help readers understand “the complexity of American society” with nuance and clarity.“People would come up to me sometimes and ask me why we didn’t cover some shooting, and I said, 'Hey, there are many places you can find that,'” Miller said. “I’m not going to spend ten cents of my budget giving any attention to a brutal government. Not going to happen.”Miller’s hope for the paper is the continuation of his work highlighting the fabric of life in communities of color, emphasizing “positive, helpful and uplifting” coverage whenever possible.“If we focus on the wrong things perpetually, then what we're doing is we are building that culture around those ideas, on the ugly angels,” Miller said. “I like to appeal to people’s beautiful angels.”"

But protecting writers from the negative impacts of these technologies is not an easy proposition.According to a forthcoming report from The Authors Guild, the median income for a full-time writer last year was $23,000. And writers' incomes declined by 42% between 2009 and 2019.The advent of text-based generative AI applications like GPT-4 and Bard, that scrape the Web for authors' content without permission or compensation and then use it to produce new content in response to users' prompts, is giving writers across the country even more cause for worry.""There's no urgent need for AI to write a novel,"" said Alexander Chee, the bestselling author of novels like Edinburgh and The Queen of the Night. ""The only people who might need that are the people who object to paying writers what they're worth.""Chee is among the nearly 8,000 authors who just signed a letter addressed to the leaders of six AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta.""It says it's not fair to use our stuff in your AI without permission or payment,"" said Mary Rasenberger, CEO of The Author's Guild. The non-profit writers' advocacy organization created the letter, and sent it out to the AI companies on Monday. ""So please start compensating us and talking to us.""Rasenberger said the guild is trying to get these companies to settle without suing them.""Lawsuits are a tremendous amount of money,"" Rasenberger said. ""They take a really long time.""But some literary figures are willing to fight the tech companies in court.Authors including Sarah Silverman, Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad recently signed on as plaintiffs in class action lawsuits alleging Meta and/or OpenAI trained their AI programs on pirated copies of their works.

She says the legal actions are a necessary step towards getting writers a fair shake.""It has to happen,"" Maccoby said. ""That's the only way these things are settled.""Maccoby said agents, including herself, are starting to talk to publishers about featuring language in writers' contracts that prohibits unauthorized uses of AI as another way to protect their livelihoods, and those of their clients. (According to a recent Authors Guild survey about AI, while 90% of the writers who responded said that ""they should be compensated for the use of their work in training AI,"" 67% said they ""were not sure whether their publishing contracts or platform terms of service include permissions or grant of rights to use their work for any AI-related purposes."")""What I hear from colleagues is that most publishers are amenable to restricting certain kinds of AI use,"" Maccoby said, adding that she has yet to add such clauses to her own writers' contracts. The Authors Guild updated its model contract in March to include language addressing the use of AI.The major publishers NPR contacted for this story declined to comment.Maccoby said even if authors' contracts explicitly forbid AI companies from scraping and profiting from literary works, the rules are hard to enforce.""How does one even know if a book is in a data set that was ingested by an AI program?"" Maccoby said.In addition to letters, lawsuits and contractual language, the publishing sector is further looking to safeguard authors' futures by advocating for legislation around how generative AI can and cannot be used.The Author's Guild's Rasenberger said her organization is actively lobbying for such bills. Meanwhile, many hearings have been held at various levels of government on AI-related topics lately, such as last week's senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on AI and copyright.""Right now there's a lot of talking about it,"" said Rumman Chowdhury, a Responsible AI Fellow at Harvard University, who gave testimony at one such hearing in June. ""But we're not seeing yet any concrete legislation or regulation coming out.""Chowdhury said the way forward is bound to be messy.""Some of it will be litigated, some of it will be regulated, and some of it people will literally just have to shout until we're heard,"" she said.

Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.“Fare-free buses are better buses”, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. “It really does add up, especially for lower income households.""The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered “transit critical,” meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds.“These routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,” Franklin-Hodge said. “If there’s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it’s the people who need it most.""While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders.“I go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it’s on a straight route,” one rider who participated in a focus group said. “The 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister’s house.”A recent GBH news reportanalyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.“It reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,” Franklin-Hodge said. “We have video. You can see, at some of the big stations … the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.”The fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It’s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future — and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.“Where can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?” Franklin-Hodge said. “We’re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.”"

And that got us wondering about a famous piece of the earth in the city that we call home: The Charles River, the inspiration for the song Dirty Water. It got us wondering just how dirty the water of the Charles really is. Edgar B. Herwick III, the guy behind GBH'sCuriosity Desk, joined GBH’sMorning Editionhosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss. This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel:So, Edgar, the Charles River — much maligned. But as we come upon Earth Day 2023, I mean, how dirty is the Charles?Edgar B. Herwick III:It's less dirty than it was in the '50s, which is when swimming was first restricted, and that was due to pollution. It's less dirty than it was in 1966 was when The Standells released that song.Paris Alston:Jeremy did a deep dive, speaking of water, into this last year, by the way.Siegel:They had never been to Boston when they wrote the song.Herwick:And their producer Ed Cobb, had been mugged in Boston, which was part of the inspiration for doing this. He wrote the song. He also wrote ""Tainted Love,"" by the way. So it's less polluted than it used to be. If we look at it now, the EPA has been giving a report card to the Charles River for decades. So this is sort of a good measuring stick in essentially assessing its cleanliness. There's lots of ways to look at how clean is a river. Their measure is like basically, how many days of the year is it theoretically swimmable and boatable, safely? So if you look back to the mid-to-late '80s, the start of this report card, the Charles River was a C and D student. It was not a great student. Its report card did not look very good. But in more recent years, they've now sort of split this report card out. They measure five different segments of the river, give each a grade. And in the last few years it's mainly now an A and B student for most of those segments. The one segment of the river that continues to lag a little bit is the Muddy River part. And even in 2022, that was up, from a D to a C, So that's improving as well. So generally not as dirty as it used to be.Alston:Okay. Well, what did it do? I mean, well, not the river itself, but what happened to improve its cleanliness?Herwick:Well, I mean, it's a number of things: Awareness, effort and money. I mean, that's kind of essentially it. So you can't understate the importance — we're talking about Earth Day, but these things that happened on the heels of that very first Earth Day in 1970: The creation of the EPA, the passage of the Clean Water Act, and the creation of an entire framework, legal and regulatory, for environmental protection issues. None of that existed when the first Earth Day happened. So that has been huge. I also spoke with Laura Jasinski, who's the head of the Charles River Conservancy. They're a nonprofit focused mainly on the lower Charles and its health, and the health of the environment around the river. And she talked about how infrastructure improvement, which has cost millions of dollars from lots of places. And they have done a better job of separating sewer drains from storm drains. So that was a huge issue for a long time in that when you'd get a lot of rain, the storm runoff would mix with sewer water and that would all end up in the river. And so you need an infrastructure where that doesn't happen. They've done a better job of that. And then there's been cleanup of the bank's areas. There's been efforts to manage the land near the river, and newer efforts, like a pilot program that they launched a few years ago where they've created a floating wetland in the lower basin.[Previously recorded]Laura Jasinski:By using basically an artificial island planted with native wetland species, we can add back some biodiversity to the sea wall edges that you see along Memorial Drive by MIT or down East Cambridge. And by adding back some of that biodiversity you can help absorb some of that pollution, and also add a lot of habitat value. That's really important for kind of the overall health of the river.[Recording ends]Herwick:So generally speaking, her overall assessment — Here's what she said:[Previously recorded]Laura Jasinski:We are definitely much better off than we were a couple of decades ago. But we also have new challenges with climate change that we need to address.[Recording ends]Siegel:Well, what are the challenges that climate change does pose?Herwick:There are numerous, but there are two main ones. One is runoff from the ground level during storms. So if you think about the lower Charles in particular, you have Memorial Drive, you have these roadways right near it. When we have a big rain, what happens is water from the ground level can't get absorbed by the ground and it ends up flowing all the way down into the river. And it carries with it all of the pollutants that we're putting at the street level. So there's all kinds of stuff that is getting into the river. So as we know, climate change means big rain events are happening more frequently. And so they're trying to figure out ways to keep that water from running off down into the river. So that's one big one.The other one is with rising temperatures comes increased likelihood of outbreaks of cyanobacteria or algae bloom. We see this, many years there'll be an outbreak of algae bloom in the river. And that stuff, not always, but it can sometimes be dangerous for pets, dangerous for people. And so trying to figure out ways to, as the temperatures rise with that happening more often, make the river a little bit more strong against that happening. So those are the two main sort of things happening right now in terms of climate change.Alston:So as you mentioned earlier, one of the measures of whether the Charles is healthy is whether it's swimmable. And so, can you swim in it?Herwick:So technically, no, it is prohibited. It remains prohibited unless you get a proper okay from the state.Siegel:But is that because it's dirty or no?Herwick:Right. And that's the thing. No. So in the past, like in the '50s, when they said no swimming in the Charles, it was mainly because of pollution. Now, most days, it is technically safe to swim in it. But the problem is we don't necessarily have the infrastructure for it, right? So you need a place to be able to get into the water safely. You don't want to hit boats, all of that stuff.Alston:Yeah. Not jumping off of a burning MBTA train. Well, that wasn't the Charles.Herwick:It was the Mystic. But The Charles River Conservancy does do, once a year for the last seven years, they do something called City Splash. And they've just announced that this year, that is happening on June 17. And that is a day where they get all the permissions from the state and then they let you swim in the Charles in a safe spot. So they sort of mark out an area and you can go swimming in the Charles on June 17. One of their goals, as we look at the next 20 years, is they want to try to figure out a way that people can swim in the Charles. They're looking for ways to find, through the summer, a place where they can establish that says, here's where you can swim. And hopefully in the future we will be able to swim in the Charles most days all summer.Siegel:For now, June 17, if you don't hear the three of us on the air, you can figure out why.Herwick:You can guess where we are.Siegel:Yeah. So, Edgar, we've made a kind of biweekly tradition of having a little trivia time with you as our question master when you're in here. I think we probably have  time for one question.Herwick:Well, since we're talking about the Charles, let's stay with the Charles. So your question is: I think we, most of us, know that the Charles empties out into the Boston Harbor, and that's where it goes. But where does it begin? Your question is, do you know where the Charles River begins?Siegel:Okay, so rivers usually begin from mountains or something like that. Wachusett Mountain?Herwick:No. Do you want a hint?Alston:Yes.Herwick:You could describe, if we think about where it begins, you could describe its journey to Boston as a marathon.Alston:Hopkinton?Herwick:Hopkinton, Massachusetts, is where the Charles River begins. And unlike the marathon, which goes 26.2 miles, it goes for 80 miles. That's how meandering the path is. And it goes through 23 different communities on its way to Boston Harbor. But yes, just like the marathon, it begins in Hopkinton.Alston:Well, look at you bringing all the knowledge we did not know that we needed. I'm so glad."

Maybe that anti-maternal instinct would not seem so unusual now, or even back then in some other part of the country. But I grew up in Tennessee, where every young woman’s two-step program was supposed to include marriage and family. I was all in on the Prince Charming fantasy wedding component, but not the birthing part. I kept my errant feelings to myself — ecstatic when I stumbled across a book about women choosing not to have kids. I dogeared the pages, relieved that my feelings were validated.I had great parents and I was lucky enough to have a mother I both loved and admired, and who was well loved by other kids. I should have wanted to embrace the role, but early on I told my mother I realized motherhood was a lifetime job and I didn’t want the job. And I didn’t change my mind later when a serious boyfriend told me not having kids was a deal breaker.You might assume that I hate kids, but no, I enjoy other people’s kids. One of my friends forbade me from reading stories to his daughter because he said I was “raising the bar” by acting out all the characters and rereading the book as many times as she wanted. And I was always the first one volunteering to rock and coo over the newborn kids of my friends. Many of those kids grew up calling me Aunt Callie. So did my real twin niece and nephew, whom I have doted on all their lives.I’m recalling my experiences because recently I’ve been stunned to see how much some people are invested in denigrating women who are childfree by choice. A choice that is none of their business. Chelsea Handler triggered a firestorm of misogynistic fury after a she createda satirical and raunchy sketchfor Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show,"" which portrayed her exciting, carefree life as a single woman with no kids.Handler responded to the apoplectic Fox host Tucker Carlsonwith the question: “Are you really upset about how much freedom I have, or are you upset that you haven’t been able to take it away from me yet?” Handler’s clapback identifies this exchange for what it is: the latest outrage in the culture wars.Childfree by choice, after all, includes choice as the operative word. A 2022 study of 1,500 Michigan adults found the percentage of young people deciding early — as I did — they don’t want kids has risen. What’s more, the study revealed that of the estimatedone in five who said no to having kids, most don’t change their minds.The news is full of incidents of neglected and abused children in the custody of people who should never have had them. So, I’m at a loss as to why women making a thoughtful choice not to have kids is threatening. But then again, I’m at also at a loss about why the folks pushing for every woman to give birth — no matter the circumstances — are generally the last ones to fight for resources to care for those children.This Women’s History Month I’m saluting the women who continue to advocate for other women to make the reproductive decisions best for them: those who are wonderful mothers, and those who wisely chose not to be."

And with cannabis having surpassed cranberries as the top crop in Massachusetts last fall, the legal industry here just keeps on budding. That hasn't come without challenges, especially when it comes to ensuring equity in the industry. But with a new cannabis reform law on the books and a new Cannabis Control Commission chair in place, there is an opportunity to turn over a new leaf, so to speak. Shannon O'Brien, chairperson of the Cannabis Control Commission, joinedMorning Editionco-host Paris Alston to discuss the state of the industry. This transcript has been lightly edited.Paris Alston:You are making yourMorning Editiondebut since you stepped into the role last fall. How have things been going, and what are your goals for the commission and the industry?Shannon O'Brien:Well, you know, this has been a steep learning curve for me. I've been the state treasurer, so I've run a large state organization with a $75 million budget. And we ran the lottery, so obviously, you know, running something that had previously been illegal but then has been incorporated into cities and towns and neighborhoods across Massachusetts. So there's a little bit of overlap there. But this is something very new to me, a sort of independent agency. And I'm trying to sort of take an assessment. I have spent the last seven months meeting with stakeholders, assessing whether or not we have resources in the right place to meet our mission. And front and center, one of the first things that I think we need to do is after five years of legalized recreational cannabis, how do we keep the promise of promoting equity to those people who have been disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs? We've had 900 people go through our social equity program. We've only had about 50 people who've gone through those programs or who qualify under that program who've actually become licensees.Now, there are many other ways that you can expand economic empowerment to people through the benefits of bringing a billion-dollar industry into Massachusetts. But that's my first priority: How do we now assess where we are, How do we make sure that as the market is becoming saturated, how do we make sure that we still maintain that promise? And then how do we rethink what equity is? And my other true priority is research. Massachusetts is the hub of education, of health care, of biotech. We have great researchers here like Staci Gruber. And we need to leverage that. So I think that figuring out, truly, what some therapies are, getting research-based proof of of how cannabis can help people. And then finally, making sure that we look at how do we regulate our industry? Can we reduce the red tape to help businesses continue to thrive in Massachusetts without leaving out public safety? We want to maintain public safety and reduce regulation. That's a mouthful.Alston:Certainly a lot to get done there. And we know that the cannabis reform law that's in place is intended to help accomplish some of those things. Where is the commission on reviewing and implementing those new regulations?O'Brien:So right now we have three different working groups. One group is looking at social consumption. Some persons may live in public housing, where cannabis is still illegal. Those people cannot enjoy the benefits or the entertainment, if you will, of utilizing cannabis either medicinally or recreationally. So ensuring that everyone has equal access to that social consumption is something that one of our groups is looking at, and determining how they can work with municipalities to make sure that, one, we create that access to the product, but two, we maintain a public health and safety. Another group is looking at the host community agreements. The HCAs are literally contracts that the communities signed with the licensees that say we will allow you to come to our town. We'll go through that process. And this is what we expect in return for allowing you to come to our community. And then finally, the group that I'm on, which is social equity, is: How do we continue to incorporate that equity lens into granting those licenses to cannabis applicants?Alston:And I'm assuming putting some onus on the host communities as well to make those things a little more accessible for those social equity applicants.O'Brien:Yes, exactly. My particular group, we've engaged a number of different stakeholders. We had an opportunity to speak with a delightful young woman, Payton Shubrick, who is woman of color living out in Springfield. And Payton, frankly, isn't even our so-called social equity program participant. But hearing some of the barriers that she went through to try to stand up her business — and frankly, she has been incredibly successful, has a wonderful retail store out in Springfield.But one of the stories that we had heard is that some communities — and again, communities are looking for revenue. It's understandable that they would want a successful and profitable cannabis business in their town or city. But one of the requirements or one of the ways they measured a successful applicant is an entity that had previous experience in the regulated cannabis market. Well, that obviously tilts the playing field towards what they call MSOs, multistate operators, those sort of deep-pocketed companies that invest in cannabis across the country.From my perspective, having been a state rep, state senator and state treasurer promoting economic opportunity in Massachusetts,I think that this industry should be tilted not towards the big guys, but the smaller entrepreneurs, both persons from different economic empowerment groups, and all groups, smaller entrepreneurs. So looking at what those barriers have been in communities and making sure that we don't tilt that against those equity applicants, and frankly create incentives for communities to not only welcome, but to embrace economic empowerment applicants.Alston:So, Shannon, I know that this is a really pivotal time for the commission. At the same time, there's not a whole lot of trust and confidence in the commission right now, considering some internal things that have been going on, as well as the fact that with those social equity applicants, there's still a small percentage of those who have been able to go through and set up shop. So how do you turn things around and regain that trust?O'Brien:Well, first of all, I'll talk about economic empowerment. And this is something that's very important to me. And the word that I have been using when I talk to staff and when I talk to people on the outside is 'impact.' We spend a lot of money, millions of dollars, running people through these programs. And I want to make sure that the programs that we're running actually match the needs of the people who are seeking either to get into the cannabis industry or find other options for people to enjoy the economic benefits of this industry. So I want us to do basically a 360. What are we doing? Is it impactful? And with the sort of window — the market is saturating, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to get into this market. And businesses are going out of business. They can't compete. Prices are plummeting. So we need to sort of look at both, one, where are we in the market? How can we help our businesses? And how can we sort of rethink what we do for social equity applicants?"

One of the panelists, Eneida Román, the CEO of Amplify Latinx, joined Paris to talk ahead of the event. This transcript has been lightly edited.The State of Race: Are Women of Color on the Rise? will be held Thursday at 6 p.m.Free virtual tickets are available.Paris Alston:Thank you so much for joining us. And I want to talk about the event and everything that we're going to discuss. But first, I know that you are new in your role at Amplify Latinx. So tell me how things have been going and what your priorities are.Eneida Román:Thank you so much, Paris. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted to be part of the conversation tonight. As you said, I am new to my role at Amplify as CEO, but I'm not new to Amplify. I'm actually one of the co-founders. It's really delightful for me to see how we've grown and how we've expanded our reach. And so our goal is to actually close those opportunity gaps for Latinos and for women and other people of color through legislation that makes sense, through policy solutions that address these opportunity gaps.Alston:I'm glad you mentioned that, because I know that earlier this week you were at the State House, along with a number of other advocates and policymakers who were pushing for salary transparency bills that would require companies with 15 or more employees in Massachusetts to post their salary ranges and share the salaries of their employees. Tell me a little bit about how that will help level the playing field and what are the disparities that exist currently.Román:That's an excellent question because there is a disparity, despite the fact that we had a wage equity bill passed in the past. This is a little bit different. And I just want to clarify that we can pass these bills without putting an employer at a competitive disadvantage and without burdensome reporting requirements. Because what we're asking is for employers of 100 employees or more to actually share with the state information that they already share with the federal government. The other bill is focused on posting the salary ranges for job openings. And there's at least a dozen other states who are doing this already. So in Massachusetts, we always pride ourselves on being innovative and being ahead of the curve, and being progressive when it comes to equity and inclusion. So this would be another way of ensuring that we are at the top of the game.Alston:You know, it's interesting, Eneida, because I think back to some of my early days and those conversations about salary negotiations were very foreign to me in many ways. I'm curious about your perspective about how that holds women of color back, and why it is important for people to be able to be transparent about these things.Román:Absolutely. You're right, because I think that money tends to be a taboo subject for so many of us, and also negotiating on our behalf. I think as women, we're always taught that we want to take care of others, but we kind of put ourselves in the backseat. And I think that also translates into how we negotiate on behalf of others, but not so much on our behalf. And so it's very interesting how we can distinguish between fairness and deserving something, right? As women, we tend to focus on, ""Well, that's fair."" It's not so much that ""I deserve it."" And I think there's a gender difference there where when a man is talking about his salary, he describes it as him being worthy of it. And so I think it's important that we normalize talking about our worth and about making sure that it's not selfish. It's something that benefits society in general. It benefits all of us because it it improves the GDP of the nation. It improves the economic prosperity of our families and the security of our homes. I think focusing on, normalizing the subject, and not seeing it as the taboo, because that, in fact, is something that really has affected our ability to negotiate on our behalf, on our own progress.Alston:It's interesting that we're going to be tackling this question tonight, as I mentioned: Are women of color on the rise? Because we see them in a number of leadership positions, including the one that you're in. We see them in state and federal government. We see them in higher education and in the business sector, etc., etc. But where do the disparities remain?Román:First of all, the pay equity gap has not improved in 20 years, Right? So that's a reality. That's for women in general. Now, when you look at the pay equity gap for women generally, white women make $0.70 for every dollar their white [male] counterparts make. Now, if we start looking at that, at the numbers, the gap from April until the end of the year, we see that women of color fall even further behind. And so, of course, my focus is on Latinas. And in the work that I do, we see that Latinas literally make half of what their white counterparts make. So they essentially end up working double the time for the same amount of pay. This is due to a number of factors. There's many more Latinas and women of color in entry level positions. So of course the salaries are lower, and so the pathway to the top sometimes has certain obstacles. I think by creating this awareness and by finding policy solutions that help remove the barriers, we clear that path and we remove those roadblocks for women and women of color."

In May, the White House also plans to disband its COVID response team.More than three years into this pandemic, the federal government never created an official commission to investigate, something regularly done after national emergencies. Efforts to create it stalled in Congress.The nonpartisan Covid Crisis Group took matters into its own hands. On Tuesday, it released its investigative report, titled ""Lessons from the Covid War: An Investigative Report.""NPR's Mary Louise Kelly spoke to the head of the group, Philip Zelikow, about the report's findings. He is also the former executive director of the 9-11 Commission.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Interview highlightsOn the findings from the ""Lessons from the Covid War"" reportThe key to this crisis and the key to what went wrong was we weren't really ready to meet an emergency. We had the best science. We were willing to spend the most money. That wasn't the problem. The problem was in knowing what to do and being ready to do it. I think the reason we wrote the report was so that people would actually have a better idea of what you really need to do in an emergency like this. And I think anyone reading this report will just say to themselves, ""Oh, I think I understand this now. I think I understand why things went so wrong in all these different ways."" And also, they'll notice a lot of things that went right, a lot of improvisations that began to work. And then we want to hold those lessons and not lose them.On the central questions they were trying to answerInstead of going back afterwards and trying to do a hindsight analysis of the statistics and correlations, we instead went into this asking ourselves, ""Why did people make the choices they made? What information was available to them when they made these choices? What tools did they think they had to choose from? What institutions ... or capabilities did they have or not have?""After the initial lockdowns – which actually folks at the time thought would only last for a few weeks – people really didn't know what to do ... With no tools, flying blind, we had to rely on all these blunt instruments, which then polarized the country.On developing a vaccine and Operation Warp SpeedIt was a success. Actually, President Trump himself had almost nothing to do with it. I think we have the best account of the origins of Warp Speed that's available in print right now. And we kind of explain what it is about it that actually worked, and also what about it really didn't work.A lot of people think of it, for instance, as a research and development program. Mostly it wasn't. Pfizer actually refused to participate in Warp Speed in developing its vaccine. It was, above all, a manufacturing and distribution program. And Pfizer, in fact, did participate in that part of it, and that's where it achieved its great successes.If politics were at play in creating the vaccineWell, politics are always in play when you're developing health decisions for hundreds of millions of people. And politics were in play here, too.Actually, the remarkable thing about Warp Speed was that it was relatively insulated from the cronyism and chaos that characterized so much of the Trump administration. It was insulated partly because a lot of it was lodged in the Department of Defense. And both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs helped to insulate the program from political interference. And actually, we give some credit to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who helped to insulate the program's management from some of his colleagues in the administration who would have interfered more with it.What lessons did you learn from the messaging around the vaccine?Well, the communication was terrible, if I may be blunt. The good news is that we have actually learned a lot about how to do good communication with people in a crisis. The bad news is we disregarded practically all of that knowledge and those lessons in this crisis.The persuasive efforts that worked  – and people did some of this – is where you actually reached out to leaders in local communities ... Some of those efforts worked quite well in persuading people to use the vaccine. But in general, at a national level, the communication efforts were poor. And actually those problems extended on into the Biden administration as well.What is the teachable moment for the next virus?I mean, this is really a crisis of competence. It's not a crisis of science. It's not a crisis of unwillingness to spend money. It's not a crisis in the sense that, ""Gosh, no one had ever heard of a pandemic danger."" There were great movies and books about it, so people knew about the danger. They had science. They were willing to spend money. The failure was in knowing what to do and how to do it and then getting ready to do it.It's like an emergency doctor who has an emergency in front of them on the gurney and is given a textbook and a bunch of money. But that doesn't tell them, ""Yeah, but I need to punch a hole in this person's chest to relieve the pressure on their heart. And how do I do that and have the training and confidence to do that in a crisis?""

Sure, you’vebanned booksby Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation.The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.”As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — becausetodayis rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl,both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans.My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstarLeBron Jamestoppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history."

His resignation comes in the wake of an allegation by a former UMass player that the coach had exhibited racist behavior toward him, asreportedby the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting.The coach and the UMass Athletic Department denied the allegations made by Cedric Rose, a transfer student who made the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star team in 2022. Rose, who is Black, said he was cut from the team once Harring dicovered Rose was keeping track of what he described as the coach's racist comments in a journal.Instead, the department cited the 22-year-old Rose for aggressive behavior prior to the spring season this year. The school's athletic director, Peter Casey, accused Rose of violating ""the team expectations and philosophy document that all players are required to uphold” -- but he declined to clarify what that meant after GBH News sought elaboration.A subsequent external UMass investigation conducted by Worcester attorney, Brigid Harrington, determined in June that while Harring, who is white, may have directed harsh words toward a Black baseball player, the coach's behavior did not violate the school's policies on harassment and retaliation.Harring did not specifically mention Rose or the investigation in his resignation letter, which was published Monday on the official UMass Lowell Athletic Departmentwebsite. But he did allude to the broader controversy.""After some reflection, I have made the difficult decision to voluntarily resign my position at the university and move on to the next chapter of my career,"" Harring wrote. ""I wish to avoid being a distraction to the university and program that I am so proud of and that has been such an important part of my life for so many years.""Despite the investigation concluding Rose's dismissal was warranted, the school acknowledged that the coach's behavior was troubling.""Though the investigator found that no policies were violated, their investigation revealed interactions that do not align with the university’s commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment,"" the university said in a statement to GBH News in June.Rose's attorney Ed Burley said his client had documented the coach's alleged racist behavior in a series of notes that he kept in a diary. Burley and the family contend that the coach's discovery of Rose's journal is what led to Cedric being kicked off the team.Coach Harring's resignation is unlikely to put the brakes on ongoing litigation initiated by Burley and the Rose family.Burley told GBH News that they are in talks with UMass Deputy seeking compensation for the Rose family. He said they have also outlined several steps for ""reforming the UMass Lowell baseball team,"" including diversity training for the coaching staff and team and a public apology for the school's handling of Rose's complaints."

This year, elected and public safety officials have tried to make sure that does not happen again. Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, who represents South Boston, joined GBH’sMorning Editionco-host Paris Alston to talk about how the city is preparing for the parade. This transcript has been lightly edited.Ed Flynn:We have absolutely zero tolerance for hate groups trying to intimidate anybody. We want a parade that's safe and welcoming to all. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our diversity. But for hate organizations to come into Boston, we have zero tolerance for them, and there's no place at all for them in this city.Paris Alston:The white supremacist group in NSC-131 made an appearance and had that banner at last year's parade. What would exactly stop someone from doing that exact same thing again? I mean, anyone could show up and display a banner. So how do you make sure that that doesn't happen? And what's going to happen if it does?Flynn:Well, I think that's the critical question you are asking. And we all support the First Amendment. But when people come in to a parade, into a public gathering, with a message of hate, a message of division and violence, that is despicable, and that's dividing people, and that is causing harm. And that's not about the First Amendment. That's about intimidating people of color, immigrant neighbors, the LGBTQ community. So certainly it's a balancing act, but as far as I'm concerned, the First Amendment doesn't apply when you are trying to intimidate people, you are trying to discriminate against people. We have seen a rise in hate crimes here in Boston, the most progressive city in the country.We have seen hate groups march through downtown Boston and through the Chinatown area, a large AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community. We also have a large LGBT community in downtown Boston. We have seen hate groups cause disruption and chaos at various hospitals,including Children's Hospital, that are assisting LGBTQ patients. We also have seen hate groupsintimidating medical professionals of colorat one of the prominent Boston hospitals.So it's important that we work together — not just the police, not just civil rights groups, but everyday residents of Boston. And when we see some type of demonstration beginning, or any type of intimidation, we need to call police. Let the police know about it. We also have to strengthen our civil rights units. We need to document these incidents, investigate them and educate the public.Alston:Council president, I also have to acknowledge that there has been evidence of at least some sort of divisions that are happening within the City Council throughout the past year. And of course, that has includeda verbal attack that Councilor Frank Baker made on Councilor Liz Breadon, who emigrated from Northern Ireland. Now, I know we're talking about two very different things, right? But I know that people have made links between those things, and we know that what happens with our leadership in this city can sometimes be a reflection of what's going on between everyday citizens. And so what have the conversations been like among the council when we talk about how we are respecting, when we're in conversation and in discourse with one another?Flynn:Well, I think, Paris, that there has to be more civility in government, in politics. I see it on both sides that people — even good people of good will — are doing and saying things that they normally would not say. But it's about recognizing our differences, respecting each other, knowing that we're not always going to agree with each other, but we have to respect each other. And if we don't respect each other in government, residents across the city, or residents across the state, will see it. When elected officials are not acting appropriately and being disrespectful, it almost is an invitation for our citizens to act that way again. So we have to get back to the basics of treating people with respect and dignity. And that starts with us right here.Alston:So lastly, council president, we've talked about a lot of heavy stuff here, but we also have to remember that the Southie parade is meant to be a joyous occasion, right? So what are you looking forward to about this year's parade?Flynn:What I like most about the parade is we celebrate not just the contributions and sacrifices of the Irish, but also the veterans' community and our military families. I had the opportunity to serve 25 years in the United States Navy.Alston:Thank you for your service.Flynn:Yes, thank you. And in my neighborhood in South Boston, we have the highest number of men that were killed in Vietnam. It's a happy time for the parade, but it's also a time when we acknowledge the incredible sacrifices made by our military families, including our Gold Star families as well. I know they'll be at the parade and it's an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and to thank them for their incredible service and sacrifice to our country."

Still, the most common reason for not casting a ballot last year was ""Too busy, conflicting work or school schedule"" (26.5% of registered nonvoters), followed by ""Not interested, felt my vote wouldn't make a difference"" (17.6%) and ""Illness or disability"" (12.5%).Among racial and ethnic groups, Asian American voters were most likely to vote early or by mail, while Black voters were the least likely. Black voters notably had the lowest rate of voting by mail out of all the groups, at 20.7%.An earlier round of surveying by the bureau previously found that 2020 saw the highest voter turnout of this century, with 66.8% of adult U.S. citizens casting ballots in that presidential election year, despite the hurdles brought on by the early months of the pandemic.

They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center — and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joinedAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath:So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose:As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff.While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university.In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022.Rath:In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose:We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction — or lack thereof — with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus.We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role — whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development — just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students.Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions.Rath:Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose:Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them.Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind.Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers.We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students.Rath:Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose:In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, ""OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?""Rath:What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty?Rose:In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those.So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, ""OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?""There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great."

They still have the option to require masking, but many major hospital systems have announced that masks will be optional in most circumstances, including at Mass General Brigham, Tufts Medical Center, Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Lahey Health.Masks are still required at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.""At Dana-Farber, we see many people who have weakened immune systems due to illness or certain types of treatment, and face masks remain an important way to help protect these patients,"" the hospital said in a statement on its website.Masks are ""optional and encouraged"" across most of UMass Memorial Health in Worcester, but the hospital specified in a note to staff last week that it is requiring masks in emergency departments, oncology clinics, and with transplant patients.The masking requirement was not a national one. Dr. Robert Goldstein, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said on Tuesday he believes Massachusetts was the last state in the country to require masking at health care facilities.""Neighboring states have similarly moved away from mandatory universal masking in health care and have pivoted to a strategy based on individual facility level criteria,"" Goldstein said at a press briefing. ""Importantly, as we make this change, we have also asked all health care facilities to develop a proactive plan that uses real-time data to identify when and where COVID-19 prevention strategies should be used, including a return to masking if necessary.""The state's decision to change the hospital masking policy has drawn protest from some activists, who say it puts immunocompromised people and many with disabilities in danger.“Universal masking has been a life saver for many people with disabilities,"" said Colin Killick, executive director of the Disability Policy Consortium in a statement. ""The fact that hospital mask mandates are being lifted this week ... will once again needlessly endanger the lives of those who are at greater risk because of their disabilities.""Rapid COVID-19 tests no longer covered by insuranceFor many, rapid antigen tests became a trusted way to return to something closer to a normal life while making sure not to spread COVID-19 to family and friends. That became especially true since early 2022, when the tests becameavailable from pharmacies with full coveragefrom insurance companies. As the emergency declaration ends, that mandated insurance coverage becomes a thing of the past.""People are going to be less likely to think about sniffles or coughs in light of COVID-19, and there will be a further barrier to getting tested because of the cost that these tests might involve,"" said Dr. Cassandra Pierre, associate hospital epidemiologist and medical director for public health programs at Boston Medical Center. ""And it's not a negligible cost.""Rapid antigen tests typically sell for roughly $10 each. Pierre noted the expense of the tests would be hardest for low-income communities who have already been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.Goldstein, the state public health commissioner, said this week that the state has a ""cache"" of rapid tests and can make themavailable where needed.""We have over 2.5 million rapid tests available if someone were to need those — any health care facility or community,"" Goldstein said. ""We're going to have to think through how do we make sure that all of the community organizations have the tests that they need, that they had access to previously. They're not going to have the same stream that they had before and the same reimbursement that they had before. But we're working to make sure that everyone who needs a test or wants a test can have a test.""Less frequent data reportingStates are no longer required to share the same level of data related to COVID-19 cases that they've had to for the last three years, including daily reporting of new cases.Data on new cases had already become increasingly inaccurate as more people self-diagnosed using home tests, and wastewater data has become a more reliable metric for community exposure, Goldstein said. But there are also changes in other reporting requirements.""We'll see changes in the hospitalization reporting,"" Goldstein said. ""We were previously getting reporting on a daily basis and we'll shift to a weekly basis, which does make sense at this moment in this pandemic and will allow us to continue to stay up to date on what's happening in the hospitals.""The state will also report new vaccinations on a weekly basis, rather than a daily one, he said.""We're working through all of those changes to make sure that the information that's necessary for communities and for health care settings will continue to be available, accessible, understandable, so that they can make local decisions about what they need to do to protect themselves against COVID,"" Goldstein said.But some public health experts say they're concerned the changing data requirements will make it harder to track the virus's spread.""I do think that we will not have as much information to go on, when and if we decide it's time to pull back or reinstitute some of our former recommendations, for the good of both infection prevention in the hospital and infection prevention in the community,"" Pierre said.The reduced reporting requirements will make studies of vaccine effectiveness more difficult, said Andrew Lover, assistant professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst. That's because negative COVID tests will no longer have to be reported.""Those studies have been reasonably easy to run through testing sites, but they're going to be a lot more complicated now that the testing will be set up quite differently,” Lover said.Access to vaccines and therapeutics isn’t changing... yetFor years now, the federal government has bought and distributed doses COVID-19 vaccines and theraputics. The system is transition to a more commercial model, but that process hasn't started quite yet.""The timeline for commercialization is more towards the fall and winter of this coming year,"" Goldstein said Tuesday. ""And so on May 11th, folks can still go and get a vaccine wherever they were getting a vaccine before. And the cost of that vaccine will still fall to the federal government. So nobody should be limited in their access to vaccines.""But some local boards of health say they're worried about their future ability to continue offering vaccination clinics.""If we had a clinic tomorrow and I had 500 people show up, I could ask the state for vaccine and receive it,"" said Tim McDonald, director of Health and Human Services for the town of Needham.That's because the state has a stockpile of vaccines, McDonald said.""That is there until it's gone,"" he said. ""And the state projects [its supply] will last into September, potentially October. The state isn't getting any more for free from CDC. Once the state stops getting more for free from CDC, it doesn't give local [boards of health] any more for free. And locals have to then enter the commercial marketplace just like a CVS or a Walgreens, and try to purchase it at quite an expensive cost.""The cost of those vaccines would be reimbursed by insurance coverage, but getting the doses would require a significant up-front expense for local boards of health.""They'll get the money back. It'll come back, you know, nine to 12 months later, in insurance reimbursements,"" McDonald said, adding many cities and towns don't have the funds to foot that bill up front.Non-clinical spaces can still be used for testing and vaccinesDuring the pandemic, the state allowed hospitals to use non-clinical spaces for uses like testing, vaccination and other services related to the pandemic. Boston Medical Center, for example, set up a testing facility in a former restaurant.""And it was a godsend to be able to do that, because otherwise it would have been open-air tents, which would not have worked in the fall and winter,"" said Dr. Pierre.It was set to revert on May 11, but the state chose to extend the exemption.Ongoing expanded access to opioid disorder treatmentDuring the pandemic, the federal government loosened restrictions around the prescription of buprenorphine — commonly known by its commercial name, Suboxone — which is used to treat opioid use disorder and help prevent overdoses. Previously, doctors were required to see patients in-person before prescribing the drug, but a pandemic rule change allowed them to prescribe it following a telehealth visit.That option was set to expire with the emergency declaration, but the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has put that change on hold.""They got more than 30,000 comments in response to that proposed rule change,"" said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center. ""So they're processing all of that, and they said we're going to take a pause and we're going to get back to you once we've thought this all through.""Komaromy said she regularly prescribes the drug, and the ability to do so by telehealth appointments is especially helpful for patients admitted to treatment centers that they can't easily leave.""This is a life-saving drug,"" Komaromy said. ""There's tons of evidence that this medication decreases risk of HIV, of hepatitis, of going to jail, helps people get back to work, helps prolong life, helps prevent overdoses. So super critical medication for people to have access to when they have opioid use disorder. So,we want to take away barriers to this medication and help people to have access to treatment."""

""And that all kind of came to an abrupt stop.""Police officers arrived at mile 21 and formed a barrier between the groups and the athletes running past, as well as stood on the street behind the cheer section. Newton Policehave characterized the response as a respectful effort to keep runners and spectators safeafter receiving complaints, but members of the running clubs say it was heavy-handed, disproportionate to police response elsewhere along the marathon route, and the result of systemic racism.The Boston Athletic Association, which runs the marathon, agreed to meet with the running groups Wednesday evening to discuss what happened. On Thursday, the BAA released a statement expressing regret.""It is our job, and we need to do better to create an environment that is welcoming and supportive of the BIPOC communities at the marathon,""the statement read.It's a tradition for the PIONEERS Run Crew to run alongside members who are competing in a marathon, said one of the group's captains, Aliese Lash.""In Chicago, in D.C., in New York, even in Berlin, we have this sort of moment of tradition of celebration,"" Lash said.Videos from Monday's race in Boston show groups of several spectators from the group running on the marathon with banners. But then, one of the crew leaders was approached by police as he got ready to greet a runner, Lash said.""An officer came up to him and grabbed him and pushed him into the crowd and said, 'Sir, let me see your I.D.,'"" Lash recalled.She said the officer then threatened to arrest the crew leader if he came on the course again.""And so we said, 'All right, like if we're not allowed to be on the course, we'll just stand behind the line like everyone else,'"" Lash said.

""When spectators continued to cross the rope, NPD with additional officers calmly used bicycles for a short period to demarcate the course and keep both the runners and spectators safe.""When asked for a response to the incident, the Boston Athletic Association released a statement that read, in its entirety, ""The B.A.A. is committed to creating a safe and enjoyable experience for athletes, volunteers and spectators across all our events.”""Our cheer zone was packed with runners and other athletes,"" said Mike Remy of PIONEERS Run Crew. ""So we wouldn't dream of doing something to impede somebody on the course.""For Remy and others in the group, the scene was shaped by its racial dynamics.""All I'm left with is, here is a cheering area primarily of Black and brown and Latin folk, and that's where we are being heavily policed,"" Remy said. ""I didn't see or hear any reports of things like that coming out of Wellesley, coming out of B.C. And having experienced those cheer zones in the past, I know what goes down there. You know, people there are drinking and boozing and real hard.

That is deeply embedded, and that's embedded in our culture, every corner of our culture.""Issues of racism are not new in the running world, Lash said, and the PIONEERS Run Crew exists to help runners of color find a place where they can feel included. Those issues are also why Lash serves on the steering committee for theBoston Running Collaborative, a BAA diversity initiative.""I'm a part of that group because they're committed to thinking about how we can make running more equitable and accessible to people of color,"" she said. ""And they share stories about how they want us to feel like we belong here, like we're welcome. But I also know that the Boston Marathon itself is a historically exclusive event that is incredibly difficult for people to enter in the first place, [and] that runs through the wealthy white suburbs of the city. And to us, especially us who are from Boston, we have to leave our city to come to Newton and then to be met with not feeling welcome, not feeling safe. It's so disappointing.""The BAA has agreed to meet with leaders of the PIONEERS Run Crew and TrailblazHers Run Co. this evening to discuss the incident, Lash said.""We have to be true to what's happening in our larger society.

""I hope that they put mechanisms in place, because the BAA is such a powerful organization, and that they take a stand on this,"" she said. ""So I'd be interested to see what they say and then what would they do moving forward.

Still, the most common reason for not casting a ballot last year was ""Too busy, conflicting work or school schedule"" (26.5% of registered nonvoters), followed by ""Not interested, felt my vote wouldn't make a difference"" (17.6%) and ""Illness or disability"" (12.5%).Among racial and ethnic groups, Asian American voters were most likely to vote early or by mail, while Black voters were the least likely. Black voters notably had the lowest rate of voting by mail out of all the groups, at 20.7%.An earlier round of surveying by the bureau previously found that 2020 saw the highest voter turnout of this century, with 66.8% of adult U.S. citizens casting ballots in that presidential election year, despite the hurdles brought on by the early months of the pandemic.

After this spring semester, though, the schools will lift that mandate.“We felt like it had served its purpose. It had kept our communities and our campuses safe,” said David Podell, president of Mass Bay Community College and chair of the state’s Community College Council of Presidents.Podell said the schools are “following the science"" and that it’s probably not necessary to continue to require the vaccine.""The rates of COVID infection are low in our communities, and we felt it was safe now to drop the mandate,” he said.Many community college students studying health care also work in hospitals and nursing homes.

A Globe review also found no Black employees among the 25 highest-paid employees at the authority, including leadership.State Auditor Diana DiZoglio has launched an audit of the authority, roughly one month after the release of a previous audit into its past performance that identified “several deficiencies” in compliance with state contract laws.“The issues raised by The Boston Globe and Andrea Estes are concerning and fall precisely within the realm of objectives I have enumerated in my social justice and equity audit plan,” DiZoglio said in a statement.Multiple employees of color sent an anonymous letter to Gov. Maura Healey in January, urging her to replace MCAA Executive Director David Gibbons and the rest of his leadership team. Healey’s office is conducting its own investigation into the allegations.“What has been raised and reported on is very concerning,” Healey told reporters on Tuesday. “We're currently reviewing all of that.”The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority “strongly refutes the assertions and the motivations behind them,” according to a spokesperson for the authority. “We take seriously the claim that any employee, client or guest feels discriminated against, mistreated, or undervalued.”The MCCA hired law firm Prince Lobel Tye LLP and principal attorney Walter Prince to “review our policies and procedures at present and in the past, including the experience of employees of color within the organization and any negative experience that an attendee of color may have had at the BCEC or Hynes.”The authority received formal notice of the audit, according to the spokesperson, and will be “working diligently” with DiZoglio’s office.In their anonymous letter to Healey, employees expressed concern about losing their jobs as a result of speaking out individually or drawing attention to cultural issues, according to the Globe.“This underscores the need for stronger protections for whistleblowers and for employers to create a culture of accountability and transparency,” Billups wrote in his statement on behalf of the Black and Latino Caucus. “The allegations of racial discrimination at the [authority] are deeply concerning, and it is critical that the authorities take swift action to investigate and address these issues.”Michael Curry, the former president of the NAACP Boston Branch, says he worked with David Gibbons to bring the NAACP national convention to Boston this summer.“Gibbons and I got together and said, 'We need to change Boston.' We proposed to the national NAACP bringing the convention here, and the convention is coming,” Curry said in an interview with GBH News. “I think that's a tremendous opportunity for [Gibbons] and the rest of his team to seize on that little victory, that relatively little victory, to then start getting big victories in systemic change within the Convention Center Authority.”This evaluation of the authority is an opportunity to investigate the lack of diversity among leadership at companies across the state, Curry said.“This is not unique to the Convention Center Authority. This is rampant throughout Massachusetts and particularly in Boston,” Curry said. “The reality is, too many C-suites and too many organizations are predominantly white and male. We've not yet cracked the code on how we tap into talent; women and people of color who have tremendous talent to offer these organizations.

For Harvard women’s basketball this year, it may have started on the Charles River.Last fall, after a pre-season practice had wrapped up, first-year head coach Carrie Moore took her team out with Harvard women’s lightweight rowing team to get a taste of  navigating as a team on the water. Unfortunately, the conditions weren’t the best.“It was, like, freezing and raining and we had just had practice and [Moore was] like, ‘All right, let’s go, let’s go to the river!’” said senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy, who had never been rowing before.Moore — who herself had also never rowed before — admits that she was scared. But the rowers, who were sprinkled among the basketball players in the boats, assured them that the odds of tipping over were low. After that, the reason for the trip started to come through.“I think you learn a lot on the boat,” Moore said. “Just in terms of it’s not an individual sport by any means. If one person is off at all in terms of their technique, the boat is shifting left or right. The balance has to be perfect.”It’s not the typical exercise for a basketball program that for 40 seasons was led by Kathy Delaney-Smith, after whom the head coaching position at Harvard is named. But in her first year as skipper, Moore has steered the Crimson’s ship to the Ivy League tournament with a 16-10 record in her first year, two wins away from an automatic berth in the NCAA tourney. For Moore, it’s all part of the plan as she aims to keep Harvard on the course Delaney-Smith set — and even go beyond.Big shoes to fillIt would be natural for just about anyone to be intimidated when trying to fill the big shoes of Delaney-Smith. Over her four decades at Harvard, she racked up 630 wins, winning nearly 70% of her games in the Ivy League along the way.But for Moore, who came to Harvard from the University of Michigan, that torch wasn’t a burden.“I don’t know if I necessarily have ever felt it as pressure,” Moore said. “I think, if anything, I just see it as a tremendous opportunity. Because she proved that you can win at a very high level here. Which means that it’s possible for us to do what we want to do.”For players like senior guard and captain McKenzie Forbes, one of the things that helped with the transition is that Moore made a lasting first impression.“I feel like the person we got that day is like the same Coach Moore that we have to this day, and I think everyone can appreciate that,” Forbes said. “And like feel that when you’re meeting someone new, you can kind of like get that vibe of like, ‘OK, what kind of person are they?’ And I think she’s very authentic, very genuine with us.”Authenticity on and off the courtOn the court, the seeds of that authenticity are on full display. During the regular season finale against Dartmouth at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion, Moore roamed the sidelines, her hands in her pockets, picking up every little detail and pulling players to the side for quick conversations the moment they stepped off the court.Even though the Big Green hadn’t won an Ivy League game all year, Moore coached with the focus you'd expect of someone in the Final Four. Harvard would go on to win in a 64-40 route.It’s the kind of attention to detail that Harvard will need as it heads into the Ivy League Tournament. But Moore’s core mantra of “Believe It” has the team feeling like they can run the table even as they face Columbia, the only Ivy League team Harvard hasn’t beaten this year.“This whole season, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and changing of the lineups with different injuries, different players being out. But she’s always like, ‘Believe It,’” McCarthy said with a snap of her finger.“All we have is all we need,” Forbes added.Over the course of the season, Moore’s learned a lot. One of the main lessons she’s come to understand is just how much patience the profession requires. She wants to hang banners and doesn’t want to settle for being third or fourth in the conference. She wants to recruit players who can change the trajectory of the program, and she hopes to make them into better people and players.Moore knows that’s coming. But if basketball is anything like rowing down a river, then even the best coaches have to get used to the water first.“I’m a Taurus and I’m extremely stubborn. And it’s incredibly hard for me to not have it all right now,” Moore said. “But I think I’ve learned that the lessons and the enjoyment is in the journey, not necessarily the destination. But we’ll get there.”"

Baseball means everything to him.""It's a life to me. It's a lifestyle. It's my passion. It's everything I think about when I wake up. It's what I've done my whole life and what I surround everything by,"" Rose told GBH News, sitting in the bleachers of the empty UMass Lowell baseball stadium this spring.Last year, he played in 52 of the team’s 58 games in 2022 and made the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star team. John Duke, the parent of a UMass student who plays on the same team, described Rose's level of play as remarkable. “One of the most extraordinary plays I sawlast year was him scooping up a buntand immediately turning and firing to second base and creating a double play.”But Rose’s baseball dreams hit an abrupt setback when he was dismissed from the team on February 14 by Ken Harring, UMass Lowell’s head baseball coach.And it’s not clear why he was cut.An email he received in March from the athletic department explaining his dismissal shed little light. “Your dismissal is based on violations of the team expectations and philosophy document that all players are required to uphold,” UMass Lowell's Athletics Director Peter Casey wrote. Neither Rose nor his lawyer has seen the philosophy document, and GBH News has not been able to obtain a copy.It’s a case of competing narratives that are now the task of an independent investigator to wade through, and possibly the federal courts. And for the 22-year-old baseball player, a decision that was made behind closed doors could make or break his career.Because Rose thinks the reason he lost out on his final season — the last season professional scouts could see him play — was his diary. More specifically, he thinks he was cut because he was keeping track of racially insensitive comments made by Harring, and the coach found out that Rose was writing them down.The coachKen Harring’s coaching record in the America East Conference is testimony to his success. Harring was named the Northeast-10 Conference coach of the year at Saint Anselm College in 2004 before taking a job as UMass Lowell’s head coach for the 2005 season,where he's been for the last 19 seasons.He has recruited some of the strongest players in the country, and a half dozen River Hawks have been selected in the Major League Baseball draft since Harring arrived. Under his leadership, the team moved up to play in Division I baseball, the highest level of competition in college athletics. And in 2022, Harring notched his 500th career college coaching victory.Harringtold the Lowell Sunhe believes he’s had an impact on every kid he’s coached. “Every kid I’ve had — whether they started four years or transferred after one year — I’ve loved them all. I pinch myself every day that I get a chance to do this.”But Cedric Rose has doubts about that.He says Harring treated him differently from the other, almost exclusively white players on the team. But the head coach controls their playing time.“Nobody else has treated me the way he's treated me,” Rose told GBH News. “And he's the one who writes our lineups. There's nothing I can do about that. There's nobody I can talk to. So, I decided the best thing to do is just write to myself.”His journal entries — some undated — include suggestions that Harring was singling him out because of his race.“I tell Ken Harring and some guys on the team that I'm going to the Student Athlete of Color affinity group,” Rose wrote on Sept. 16, 2022. “And Ken says, ‘I actually have a problem with that whole group. If you guys want to be treated equal, I want the same rights. Why can't I go to the group?’”In the spring of 2021, Rose wrote that Harring approached him and another player of color to talk about politics. The journal entry says Harring told the players “I can complain about gas prices because that’s your guy’s guy [President Joe Biden] who did that not mine ... I didn't vote for him.’”Rose wrote that he was mystified by the exchange.“I have never once talked about politics with him,” Rose wrote two years ago. “He has no clue my stand on anything politics but he came up to the 2 colored kids assuming we voted for Biden and wanted to let us know that he voted for Trump.” (A review of Harring’s social media accounts shows he has retweeted messages from far-right individuals, including Candace Owens, a Black talk show host and activist who became a high-profile defender of former president Donald Trump.)One of Rose’s journal entries recounts wearing an America East athletic conference T-shirt that said “Equality” during batting practice. “After a couple guys hit BP, Ken turned around looks at me ... with a disgusted face and tells me ‘Go take that shirt off now,’” Rose wrote.Another journal entry describes Harring confronting Rose and another player of color at the batting cages to complain about rap music. “What is so great about rap music, all it is is glorifying drugs, gangs, violence and mistreating women,” Rose recounted Harring saying.Harring did not respond to GBH News’ efforts to reach him for this story.Rose shared the contents of his diary with two teammates whom he roomed with in an apartment near the sprawling campus. For reasons unknown, Rose says, in late January one of his teammates informed Harring that Rose was taking notes.Days later, on February 8, Harring sent an urgent text message to Rose calling for a morning meeting in his office with the coaching staff.“And they sit me down,” Rose said. “And the first thing that comes out of Ken Harring's mouth is, ‘Your teammates are coming up to us, telling us, you feel like you’re getting treated differently because of the color of your skin.’He stares me in the eyes and says, ‘OK, let’s get transparent. Do you think I’m racist?’”Rose said he did not answer directly but implied that he thought Harring was “prejudiced,” based on what he had observed. The exchange, described as tense, went on for more than 30 minutes.  The young baseball player left the meeting angry and feeling powerless. He went home and punched a hole in a wall of the apartment he shared with two teammates. The next day he was instructed by the coach not to come to practice.Less than a week later, on February 14, Rose was dismissed from the team.A week after he was ordered to clean out his locker, Rose, his sister and his parents — Michelle Johnston and Carl Rose — met with Harring and other school officials at the family's request.When people with the school asked for an explanation of the diary, family members said that Rose wrote things down as an outlet for his mental health, not as a weapon to be used against Harring.According to notes taken by Rose’s family at the meeting, the coach scoffed at the idea that his dismissal from the team had anything to do with race and offered various reasons for kicking their 22-year old son off the team. According to the parents, Harring said he was concerned about their son's mental health, citing Rose’s alleged use of the N-word in the locker room, implicitly threatening a white roommate by playing rap music with lyrics that reference snitching, and punching a hole in the wall of his bedroom after his initial meeting with the coaching staff.Rose said one of the assistant coaches has also played rap music in the locker room and denies ever threatening his teammates, whether through music or directly.None of those reasons was explicitly cited in the Athletic Department’s official letter of dismissal in March.After an initial inquiry into the allegations, Casey, UMass Lowell’s athletic director, sent an email to Rose on March 8 upholding Harring’s decision to oust him from the team.But after Rose and his family complained, university officials in March hired an outside investigator to get to the bottom of the conflict, which Boston civil rights attorney Ed Burley — who represents the family — said is meaningful.“The university looked into it and they found that that it had sufficient merit to open a full investigation,” he told GBH News.The university issued a statement to GBH News, saying, “UMass Lowell is committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming environment for its entire campus community. Just as it does for any allegations of discrimination, the university is investigating this matter in a prompt, fair and confidential manner.”One incident, two storiesPeople in Rose’s life describe him as a skilled and affable player.Brent Edmunds, who was an assistant baseball coach at UMass Lowell until he left the team last year, described Rose as “very, very talented” and someone “who put in a good effort.”“He was well-liked by his teammates. You know, never — never really showed anything negative,” Edmunds said in a telephone interview with GBH News.One of Rose’s teammates — speaking anonymously for fear of “being taken out of the lineup” and hurting his baseball career — echoed Edmunds’ characterization, saying, “Cedric got along with everyone.” He said he often heard Rose complain about being “treated differently” by Harring.Rose’s father, Carl, is Black. His mother, Michelle Johnston, is white. She said she believes her son, and believes race is at the core of why he was kicked off the team.“As a mom, a white mom of a young man of color, how do I support my son other than to stand behind him?” she said. “This literally started as him [the coach] learning about a journal that Cedric was only doing to help himself work through stuff. And it led to a coach trying to protect himself.”But Ann Hardy Draper of Lowell doesn’t buy it.Draper is the unofficial “den mother” for the River Hawks. Her son just wrapped up his last year on the team.“I’m coming to the end of the fourth season that I’ve been around the team. I’m usually the one that sends out emails about changes in schedule or organizing group gifts and things like that,” she said.She dismisses the accusations leveled at the coach and said she believes the Roses are using the issue of racism to “smear” Harring. Based on conversations with other parents and team members, her understanding is that Rose was dismissed “after an incident where he had torn apart the apartment he lives in with two other players, another one of whom is also a minority player. He made death threats. And he would play really loud music and crank it louder when it talked about killing white people.”Rose denies threatening anyone.“I never heard my son come home and say that Cedric had brought up anything about there being a racial component or about being treated differently at all when he was let go from the team,” Draper told GBH News.Draper also said that race did not come up in a private Facebook exchange she had with Michelle Johnston after Cedric left the team, but Johnston raised it subsequently in a public online forum.“The parents I've spoken to are disgusted [about the allegations of racism], as disgusted as I am,” Draper said. “First of all, if Ken was a racist, in my opinion, why did he recruit Cedric? Why?”She added: “If you really thought the coaches and the athletic department were racist, why would you want him back on that team?”Cedric’s father, Carl Rose, said there have been other racist incidents at the university that have deeply impacted his family. Most disturbing, he said, was the annual “Hot Stove” team fundraiser in February of last year attended by parents, the coaching staff and team members that featured a white comedian. The comedian made Carl Rose, the only dark-skinned man in the room, the butt of racist jokes, causing “extreme discomfort” for him and his family.“I was upset, embarrassed,” Carl Rose said. “And the worst part was after he was done, Ken came over to me and put the light back on me saying, ‘Oh, I know, Carl, you felt uncomfortable, because I sure did!’”Draper was also there that night, but she remembers the incident differently.“His jokes got progressively ugly and racist,” she said. “It was so embarrassing.Ken got out of his seat and went right over to the table where Cedric’s parents were, apologizing up and down. To their credit, they said they understood that it wasn’t [Ken’s] fault.”The incident weighed heavily on the family, even though Carl Rose said his son was never an activist or very conscious of racial issues.The sportStill, for a young Black man, simply stepping onto a baseball field is a measure of activism. There are very few Black collegiate baseball players in the country.“It is a scarcity, to say the least,” said Noah Jackson, an associate head baseball coach at the University of California-Berkeley, who, as a Black coach, is also a rarity in college baseball.“It is still a sport that is a pay-to-play sport for a lot of kids,” Jackson said. “It costs an exorbitant amount of money to play summer travel baseball, and then it costs an exorbitant amount of money to come to college and play baseball because you still have to pay since there are no full scholarships.”Jackson said racism in sports also cannot be dismissed as a factor for the scarcity of Black athletes playing the game today.In Division I men’s baseball, nearly four in five of the student athletes are white, according to a2021-2022 reportcompiled by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. Only 4.2% of players were Black or African American. And the lack of representation on the college level on the field and in coaching is reflected in the MLB.According to TIDES, 7.2% of MLB players were Black on Opening Day last March.Cedric Rose said he feels a personal responsibility to reverse this trend in baseball.“I’ve never had too many African American teammates,” he said. “I think the most I’ve had on one team at one time was, like, four. So, it speaks volumes going out there and proving that we can play at a high level. It means a lot.”UMass Lowell’s athletic department has been lauded for its efforts to establish inclusivity and equity. It scored a perfect 100 on the NCAA's 2022Athletic Equality Index,one of just 15 Division I athletic departments to do so, according to the NCAA. Casey, the athletic director, wasquoted in a UMass Lowell press release last year,saying, “I am so proud that we continue to be among the leaders in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion, helping to set a standard in college athletics, but I know that there is always more work that can be done and we must continue to push ourselves in this area every day.""The Rose family attorney, Ed Burley, who is chair of legal redress for the local NAACP, said he plans to file a formal complaint in federal court on behalf of the family following the expected release of the university’s investigation. He told GBH News he would like UMass Lowell to live up to its reputation, but believes the Harring affair flouts the school’s promised goals of equality.“Cedric, by keeping a diary, has engaged in protected conduct, which is complaining or memorializing either harassment or hostile work environment claims,” Burley told GBH News. “And then for doing so, he’s been retaliated against.”Meanwhile, the baseball season has ended and Cedric Rose did not get to play this spring. That meant the collegiate and professional scouts did not see him on the field.But he said he is determined to find a way to return to the game. A few weeks ago, Rose graduated with a degree in economics from UMass Lowell, but even as a college graduate, he still hopes to be seen by other scouts.Now, he is playing occasionally with a summer league. He said he hopes that will lead to an invitation to play regularly, somewhere.“Acouple of weeks into the summer, people [on summer teams] will start dropping off left and right,” he said, “whether that’s injuries, whether they hate where they are and just want to go home. And hopefully I get a phone call to go play baseball, and then I’ll leave that day.”"

It was frustrating that I was a shell of myself, couldn't move.""Boston was looking to extend a wild postseason ride that already included five wins when facing elimination — twice in the East semifinals after falling behind 3-2 to the 76ers, and three straight times against the Heat.Instead, for the second straight year the Celtics' season ended with a team receiving a trophy on their home floor.Jaylen Brown led Boston with 19 points but struggled to find a groove while going just 8 for 23 from the field and 1 for 9 from the 3-point line.""Just a terrible game when my team needed me most,"" Brown said. ""JT hurt his ankle the first play of the game. You could see it swelling up. He couldn't move out there. ... I failed. It's tough. I give credit to Miami.

And Game 6 savior Derrick White kept his team in contention with 18 points, but left late after suffering a knee injury.""This is how the game is. Sometimes the ball doesn't roll your way,"" Brogdon said.Boston ended their postseason run 5-6 at home.""I thought in the first quarter and a half or so we continued to fight defensively, even though our shots weren't falling,"" coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""Then we just couldn't score.""It was a microcosm of a season that began with a coaching change the day before training camp after Ime Udoka was given a yearlong suspension for having an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the organization.Mazzulla took over and led Boston to a 57-win regular season and its fifth conference finals appearance in seven seasons.Now Boston enters an offseason that could change the franchise's immediate future with a decision to be made about Brown, who is eligible to receive a five-year contract extension worth as much as $295 million.But Brown said it's not something he'd even began to ponder as he comes to grips with the end of a playoff run he thought would last much longer.""I expected to win today and move on. That's what my focus was on. That's what my focus has been on. We failed. I failed. That's all I can think about at this moment. We'll cross that bridge when we get there."""

He provided no more details.Fidencio Valencia, a child's uncle, told media outlet Noticias Caracol the children were starting to talk and one of them said they hid in tree trunks to protect themselves in a jungle area filled with snakes, animals and mosquitoes. He said they were exhausted.""They at least are already eating, a little, but they are eating,"" he said after visiting them at the military hospital in Bogota, Colombia. A day earlier, Defense Minister Iván Velásquez had said the children were being rehydrated and couldn't eat food yet.The children were traveling with their mother from the Amazonian village of Araracuara to San Jose del Guaviare when the plane went down.The Cessna single-engine propeller plane was carrying three adults and the four children when the pilot declared an emergency due to engine failure. The small aircraft fell off the radar a short time later and a search for survivors began.Dairo Juvenal Mucutuy, another uncle, told local media that one of kids said he wanted to start walking.""Uncle, I want shoes, I want to walk, but my feet hurt,"" Mucutuy said the child told him.""The only thing that I told the kid (was), 'when you recover, we will play soccer,' "" he said.The children survived on cassava flour and seedsAuthorities and family members have said the children survived eating cassava flour and seeds, and that some familiarity with the rainforest's fruits were also key to their survival. The kids are members of the Huitoto Indigenous group.After being rescued on Friday, the children were transported in a helicopter to Bogota and then to the military hospital, where President Gustavo Petro, government and military officials, as well as family members met with the children on Saturday.An air force video released Friday showed a helicopter using lines to pull the youngsters up because it couldn't land in the dense rainforest where they were found. The military on Friday tweeted pictures showing a group of soldiers and volunteers posing with the children, who were wrapped in thermal blankets. One of the soldiers held a bottle to the smallest child's lips.Gen. Pedro Sanchez, who was in charge of the rescue efforts, said that the children were found 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from the crash site in a small forest clearing. He said rescue teams had passed within 20 to 50 meters (66 to 164 feet) of where the children were found on a couple of occasions but had missed them.Two weeks after the crash, on May 16, a search team found the plane in a thick patch of the rainforest and recovered the bodies of the three adults on board, but the small children were nowhere to be found.Soldiers on helicopters dropped boxes of food into the jungle, hoping that it would help sustain the children. Planes flying over the area fired flares to help search crews on the ground at night, and rescuers used speakers that blasted a message recorded by the siblings' grandmother telling them to stay in one place.Colombia's army sent 150 soldiers with dogs into the area, where mist and thick foliage greatly limited visibility. Dozens of volunteers from Indigenous tribes also joined the search.Ranoque, the father of the youngest children, said the rescue shows how as an ""Indigenous population, we are trained to search"" in the middle of the jungle.""We proved the world that we found the plane... we found the children,"" he added.The Colombian government, which is trying to end internal conflicts in the country, has highlighted the joint work of the military and Indigenous communities to find the children.

Maura Healey is proposing a $742 million package of tax cuts in the state budget she will file Wednesday, offering relief for parents, renters and seniors alongside other tax reforms.Healey's plan shares common ground with the tax proposal former Gov. Charlie Baker could not get over the finish line his final year in office, and it features some other measures that have been kicking around Beacon Hill for years, like a new live theater tax credit and changes to the way locally produced hard cider is taxed.Announced Monday morning at the Demakes Family YMCA in Lynn, the tax package is centered around a child and family tax credit that Healey touted on the campaign trail. Healey's office said 700,000 taxpayers would benefit from the $600 per-dependent credit, helping them keep up with climbing costs for child and senior care.The child and family tax credit, for children under 13, people with disabilities and senior dependents age 65 and up, combines two interrelated existing benefits — the Household Dependent Tax Credit and Dependent Care Tax Credit — while removing the cap on dependents, and increasing the benefits. At a cost to the state of $458 million for the next budget year, it's the single largest piece of Healey's proposal.Healey said she and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll are filing this package for people ""who are struggling to get by as the cost of living continues to skyrocket past them – the family watching their grocery bill grow each week, the young mom who wants to return to her dream job but can’t afford child care, the recent college graduate who can’t afford both his rent and student loan payments, the seniors who want to keep the home where they raised their family.""Along with the child and family credit, the plan would increase the rental deduction from $3,000 to $4,000, and double to $2,400 a credit for low-income seniors paying property taxes or rent. In a pair of moves Healey described as ways to make Massachusetts more competitive with other states, the bill would use credits to eliminate the estate tax — which currently kicks in at $1 million — for estates valued up to $3 million, and cut the tax rate on short-term capital gains to 5% from 12%Last year, Baker filed a nearly $700 million tax plan that also would have boosted credits for dependent and child care, increased the rental deduction, doubled credits for seniors, reformed the estate tax and cut the short-term capital gains tax.The House and Senate each passed different tax relief bills last year, never agreeing on specifics. Ultimately, legislative leaders shelved the bills after realizing the state would be returning $3 billion in excess revenues to residents, pledging to revisit the issue this year.Senate President Karen Spilka, at the start of the session in January, called for lawmakers to pass progressive tax relief “soon.” Tax policy bills, though, must start in the House, where Speaker Ron Mariano has talked about watching the state’s fiscal picture before acting.Healey’s tax package would also:expand the list of occupations that qualify for apprenticeship tax credits, and double the statewide cap on those credits to $5 million;increase the cap on Housing Development Incentive Program credits, with the goal of producing more market-rate housing in gateway cities;increase the cap to $8 million for the state's dairy tax credit, which Massachusetts Dairy Farmers Association President David Shepard said would ""greatly help offset the forecasted difficult times ahead in dairy costs of production and pricing"";exempt employer assistance with student loan repayment from taxable income;expand tax-deductible commuter transit benefits to include regional transit passes and bike commuter expenses;double the credit for lead paint abatement, and double the maximum credit for septic tank repair or replacement in a primary residence, and;extend the expiring brownfields tax credit for cleanup of contaminated properties through 2028."

It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: Aïda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. She’s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa.The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called“This is Where I Am.”“I have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,” Muluneh said. “I think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.”Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery.Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said.“I know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,” she said. “For those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.”She brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props.“I utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,” Muluneh said. “It's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.”This project is the first time in her career that she’s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square.“I liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,” Muluneh said. “To try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style.She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art.“It's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,” Muluneh said. “I enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.”"

They may not have strong credit histories or valuable collateral to put up for a loan, and they may not have relationships with banks that can help them get in the door.The Equity Alliance for Business  — a new program assembled by Eastern Bank and several non-profits that serve minority-and LGBTQ-owned businesses — is hoping to change that by radically lowering the barriers to bank loans for disadvantaged entrepreneurs.The idea is that minority/woman/LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs who are being supported and trained by groups including the Black Economic Council of Massachuetts and the Massachusetts LGBT Chamber of Commerce can use those relationships to lower the requirements for a small business loan from Eastern Bank.“For loans, up to $100,000, when the business is partnering with one of our community referral organizations, that they've either gone through a technical assistance program or they have been doing other training and development with those nonprofits … we have actually eliminated the minimum credit score requirement,” said Quincy Miller, Eastern Bank president.Under federal “fair banking” rules, all borrowers are required to meet the same criteria for getting a loan, but Miller said that winds up creating unfair outcomes, because, for example, a minority entrepreneur may not have the credit history or collateral that a white borrower with generational wealth can bring to the table. The result of applying identical criteria is a disparity in who gets loans.Miller said it took Eastern Bank a year to prove this disparity to federal regulators, which allowed them to open a “special purpose credit program,” creating lower thresholds for disadvantaged businesses to qualify for the same loans — including reducing and in some cases doing away with a credit score requirement. That, he said, “is pretty groundbreaking.”The key, Miller said, is working with partner organizations that train and mentor small businesses, and that can provide a kind of “character reference” that the businesses are ready for the financing. Those nonprofits “spend every day helping to invest back into women-owned businesses, community businesses of color, etc.” he said. “They have those relationships. We're leveraging the character aspect of credit, which is an important aspect, not just the numbers part of credit.”Karla Morales, who runs a Marlborough-based cleaning service called Your Home Detox and a website called Bohio Clean to connect other cleaners to new clients, is the first to get a loan under the new program. Morales — who currently employs 10 people — said her vision is to run an eco-friendly cleaning service and also “ethically connect” potential customers and cleaning service providers, to help “ensure that people who work in the cleaning industry are getting paid for the work that they do.”But she first needed financing to keep that vision moving forward.“We were constantly denied by other banks,” Morales said. Because she didn't have credit history at the timeand since the business was new and did not have a track record, “it was difficult for me to get capital.” Morales got a $100,000 loan that she plans to use for sales and marketing, as well as to have a cushion to cover costs when commercial customers are slow paying their bills.Daniel Vidaña, president of Innovation Studio, a local small-business incubator, said the new credit offering from Eastern Back is a big step forward, but it is not a magic solution for everyone.Vidaña said that even Eastern can’t give a loan to an entrepreneur who has not registered their business, set up a company bank account or who hasn’t been sending invoices to customers. These are things that the community organizations like his can help entrepreneurs put in place, so that they are ready to go to a bank like Eastern for funding — and they can come to the bank with the endorsement of a trusted community partner.Eastern’s loan package “is not a solution for everybody, but it clearly clears the decks for some people who are almost there,” he said.Vidaña said he is not aware of other banks that are working on this kind of credit flexibility. “I applaud Eastern Bank for doing that because I think it's a long time coming,” he said. And he says “they have the right relationships with the other organizations and vice versa to essentially support the unique needs [of companies] that are going to be part of this process.”But he cautions that “the time frame for us to know whether this is an impactful approach is going to be a while.”One of the partner organizations in the new alliance is Mill Cities Community Investments, a Lawrence-based nonprofit lender that already offers loans specifically tailored to traditionally underserved communities. Executive Director Glynn Lloyd said it is important for commercial banks like Eastern to look for new ways to get capital to minoirty-owned business. “The credit system has discrimination built into it,” Lloyd said. “For a lot of Black and brown people, the credit scores reflect some institutional racism.”So Lloyd says he is excited about being part of Eastern’s new alliance “because this is an example of where you have a really untraditional bank trying to figure out how do we get debt products out to our folks that have been historically kind of shut out.”"

She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state’s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states.“We need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,” Healey said.As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up.Healey’s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year.

"[0.27940956194664884, 0.23252741208159944, 0.2275068270578665]",0,N/A - not specified,Education,"COVENTRY, England — When she finished high school, Helen Kinchin got what was supposed to be a temporary job, after which she planned to go to college.Fourteen years later, she was in the same job and had two kids, but still no degree.That's when Kinchin, now 36, found a way to finally resume her education in a way that was fast, simple and comparatively cheap.She enrolled at a university where students can start at any of six times during the year, take just one subject at a time for the same four hours every weekday, and end up with a bachelor's degree in three years. There are no electives; just about the only choice is whether to go in the mornings or the afternoons.The place she found all this was CU Coventry, originally called Coventry University College, an example of a ""no-frills"" approach to higher education in this historic industrial city about 100 miles northwest of London. An education here can be cheaper, faster, simpler and less intimidating for students at a time when going to college has otherwise become more complicated, with all kinds of add-ons that push up prices.The approach can make life easier for exactly the kinds of people universities are trying to recruit in many countries where enrollment is declining, including the United States. Getting child care is simpler for student parents when they have a predictable schedule, for example, rather than classes that meet at different times on different days. And not all students care about electives or extracurricular activities; a growing number just want to graduate.This assembly-line-style approach also vastly lowers the cost of doing business for the university. CU Coventry doesn't have to juggle faculty assignments or classroom space or offer many of the extras other institutions have added over time that don't have anything to do with education.""When we started, we stripped things back,"" said Ian Dunn, the affable, white-bearded provost, who sits in a pink hoodie in a lunchroom filled with blond wood and natural light. ""We're very much focused on transactional learning — the systematization of the teaching approach and the way in which we employ people to work in that model.""The library, for instance, has only books connected to the subjects of the classes. There are no athletics, though students can participate in the broader activities of the parent Coventry University nearby, or pay extra if they decide to use the gym. And faculty don't do research; they only teach.""We fit around the lives of students rather than making them fit around us,"" Dunn said.It wasn't entirely out of the goodness of their hearts that administrators here created a low-cost university. The program was spun off a decade ago by the then-169-year-old Coventry University.The move came after universities in England were allowed to raise tuition to a maximum of 9,000 pounds a year (since raised again to 9,250 pounds, or about $11,750). That was nearly triple the previous amount, and universities were encouraged to compete for students.""This was an existential moment for a university like ours,"" Dunn said. With tuition being increased by so much, ""we felt there was a whole potential demographic that was going to be pushed out of higher education with that change.""That demographic, he added, would most likely be ""more disadvantaged students or students tied to their locations because of financial or personal responsibilities.""So the university set out to ""design a model where we could control the cost of the delivery of education so we could offer back to the students some of that savings.""""You don't have to sacrifice your life"" to go to collegeWhen it opened to students in 2012, CU Coventry set its price at 4,800 pounds a year, about half of what the top universities charge. It offered degrees in subjects including business management, accounting, cloud computing, marketing and public relations, tourism and hospitality management, and early childhood development and learning. It has since added campuses in Scarborough and London.Though some students come straight from high school or after a gap year, the average age is 35. ""Mature,"" they're called, in England.A small but growing proportion of students at U.S. colleges and universities are also older than the traditional 18 to 22. They're among the more than 40 million adults who have some college credits but no degrees, and who recruiters are going after as enrollment falls. Among the top reasons they haven't come back, according to a Gallup survey: cost and family responsibilities.Those are two things CU Coventry has tried to fix, with its comparatively low tuition and daily four-hour classes.""People can study while having obligations, family obligations. You don't have to sacrifice your life,"" said one student here, Mabel Makombore, who works part time while in school. ""We're all struggling financially,"" she said.This West Midlands city's dominance in auto manufacturing made it a German bombing target during World War II, an attack still visible in the ruins of the cathedral — left as a memorial — but the car  factories and the jobs they represented are mostly gone.CU Coventry students talk of other advantages in addition to the price, including each term's focus on a single subject: what Dunn referred to as a ""modular delivery"" system. ""We're only doing one thing at a time,"" said Kinchin, who just graduated with a degree in applied bioscience and is moving on to get a Ph.D.The idea, also generally known in England as block teaching, has begun to spread. It has been adopted in the last few years in some form or another, and for all or some students, by the University of Suffolk, Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Plymouth, De Montfort University in Leicester and UA92 in Manchester, a school cofounded by Lancaster University and former members of the Manchester United football club for people from disadvantaged backgrounds who might otherwise not go to college. It's also being used in Sweden and Australia.Many students like the strict pathway that allows them to stay on track to graduation. That's something being tried by a few universities in the United States, too, where students can find themselves drowning in choices. That situation is only getting worse as schools have added tens of thousands of new programs in an effort to attract more students, who end up with more credits than they need to graduate and spend more money on and time in college.U.S. students at four-year universities, on average, accumulate 15 credits more than they need to graduate, and at community colleges, 22 credits more, according to the advocacy group Complete College America.A less intimidating way to get a degreeHaving to learn a crush of subjects simultaneously was among Ashkan Bahgozen's fears about going to college while balancing the job of managing his family's café. ""I was very intimidated about courses overlapping,"" he said. He just wanted to get a degree.That's a surprisingly widespread sentiment among CU Coventry students.""You can focus"" on your principal discipline, said student Mabel Makombore, who is studying accounting and finance after having previously started and never finished a degree in fashion, business and marketing at a more traditional university in London. ""You're not going backward and forward and mixing things up.""Her classmate, Monika Myslewska, 33, added: ""My main advice is, don't go to university right out of school. Wait until you know what you want to do.""CU Coventry is not for everyone. Around 30% of this school's first-year students drop out before the second year, a spokesperson said. (The figure is misleadingly high because it includes the number who enroll and never start.) Still, that's lower than the combination of first-year students at U.S. universities who drop out or don't show up.One reason may be that many college students want to explore topics outside of their majors. But the CU Coventry model, Kinchin said, frees students from having to find their own way through endless numbers of electives, and keeps them focused on the end goal.""When students start off, they might be less confident. But by the time they finish, they're quite confident,"" she said.That's Bahgozen's story. ""If you met me four years ago, I was a shy, quiet kid,"" he said. Back then, he had to take ""access courses,"" the equivalent of remedial classes in the U.S., for students who don't meet college-level academic requirements.Now he's finished his degree in management and leadership with a ""first,"" or first-class honors, the highest level. He has begun a job in the United States for the Liverpool-based Everton Football Club's soccer schools.From the university's point of view, said Dunn, giving students choices ""adds lots of cost. Part of the expense of running a university is the complexity of timetabling and scheduling and personalizing that to the individual."" That makes CU Coventry's fixed format cheaper to provide.This doesn't mean that some administrators at the college haven't tried to raise tuition. That has happened at least once, Dunn said — during a management meeting he did not attend.""I behaved appallingly at the next management meeting,"" he said, ""and we brought the price back down.""This story about the cost of college was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

And it's being waged by goats.About 300 of them are spread out along the foothills and steep ridges of the Verdugo Mountains, which loom over multi-million dollar homes at the end of a cul de sac. The goats are busy chomping away on the dried-out vegetation that's exploded after this year's drought-busting rains.Seemingly oblivious to the 94 F heat, the animals are hard at work devouring several acres of dead, yellowed grasses, scrubby bushes and cactus, as well as some of southern California's most invasive plants, including star thistle and black mustard.""There's very little they won't eat. Even things that seem impossible. I don't know how their digestive systems deal with it, but they do,"" Michael Choi told NPR, squinting out at his herd from under a brown felt cowboy hat.Choi, 30, is the owner of Fire Grazers Inc., a service that uses its herds of goats to clear brush from hillsides, flatlands and other hard-to-climb terrain.It's a family business that he took over from his father a few years ago and now runs with two other brothers.Even after more than a decade in the business, he is still confounded by how the goats make such easy work of an array of prickly and painful plants.""It's mind boggling that they'll even eat star thistle, considering it's so painful to grab,"" he said. ""It's invasive. It just spreads everywhere. And if you try to weed whack it, you wind up getting poked in the face and then all over the body. But goats will come up to that and they'll just eat it up because it tastes good to them.""Choi's company is busier than ever this year after the drought-breaking rains of this pastwinter. The downpour led to more growth, which has led to greater demand. That, Choi said, has extended his season by a couple of months, from March through what potentially could be the early weeks of October.""There's so many more people who need the goats. And, we're moving slower than we normally would, because a goat doesn't care if there's more food. They eat at their pace. So we actually had to purchase more goats just to keep up with the jobs we have,"" Choi explained, noting that he's added a couple hundred more goats to his total ""trip,"" bringing them up to about 900.It's the herd's last day on this plot of land. Over two weeks, they've cleared about 14 acres of the vegetation that fuels wildfires. (They eat about one acre a day.)And in a few hours, Choi will be transporting the group to their next job in Rancho Palos Verdes, another wealthy enclave surrounded by tough-to-climb terrain. It's one of about five sites the company has going. So far, Fire Grazers Inc. has been contracted by the cities of Torrance, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, Orange County and even private homeownerswith sprawling estates in Beverly Hills and Calabasas.While the practice of targeted grazing goes back centuries, it has been pushed aside by machines and chemical herbicidesin the modern era. But following the unrelenting barrage of blazes in recent years, which have ravagedan average of nearly 400,000 acres of land each year,it's become a bigger part of California's strategy to reduce wildfire risk. Last year, the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection issued a grant for a pilot program testing whether goats can lower the risk of wildfires in a state preserve.Anything you can do, goats can do betterPatty Mundo, vegetation management inspector for the Glendale Fire Department, said it was local residents who suggested the idea of the goats two years ago. Since then, she's brought Choi and his goats back for an annual ""Bleat and Greet"" event, where the community is invited to get to know the fire-fighting heroes.It's a great way to raise awareness about the importance of proper land management, Mundo said.""We've had many fires in that exact same hillside where the goats are,"" she told NPR. ""And because it's right next to homes, the purpose of it was to create a buffer — a fire break — so that if we were to ever have a fire in that area, it'll stop or at the very least, slow it down.""Mundo has been working for the city since 2018, and she said there's been a fire ""every single year"" with the exception of 2022.If it were up to her, she'd lease the herd for a much longer stretch, she said. The city owns about 500 parcels of land, and with the budget that's allocated to fire prevention — $62,000, plus another $14,000 specifically for the goats — they can only afford to clear a fraction of it every year.""It's not fair,"" Mundo acknowledged. In her role, she said, ""I'm holding people accountable to clear their brush, but yet we can't keep up with ours.""The worst is when she gets calls from homeowners wondering when her department plans to eliminate dangerous overgrowth. ""They call us to tell us they're concerned ... and it just kills me,"" she said.City officials have applied for a series of grants that could more than triple Glendale's fire prevention budget, according to Mundo. That would mean more money to pay for the goats to graze for longer periods.As it stands,Mundo said the goats have saved the city precious financial resources. Brush crews are far more expensive because they rely on power tools, which need fuel. ""They have to use heavy equipment like chippers. And sometimes they have to take the vegetation to a landfill. So that's just an added cost,"" she said. There are also additional fees to remove poison oak, which is common in the Verdugo Mountains.In contrast, all the goats need is water,mineral and salt blocks, and a large Anatolian shepherd dog to ward off coyotes. They can also climb up steep mountainsides, eat the poison oak and work under the blazing sun without suffering from heat stress or heat exhaustion.Targeted grazing is just one of many tools to fight wildfiresLynn Huntsinger, a professor of rangeland ecology and management at the University of California, Berkeley, noted targeted grazing works best when it's used in combination with other wildfire reduction measures, especially prescribed burning.""In an ideal world, we would have used goats or sheep or even cows, after the big fires we've had in recent years,"" Huntsinger told NPR.That would have had the greatest impact in eliminating noxious and invasive plants, because the animals would consume any regrowth of the unwanted vegetation, she explained.And even in places where there has not been a fire, regular grazing routines over time can eventually exhaust the root stock, preventing them from resurfacing and permanently changing the biomass of the space. That's for the better, according to Huntsinger.She added: ""When we think about wildfire risk reduction and good land management, we need to be thinking like artists, using a wide palette of all of the tools at our disposal.""Back in Glendale, Choi said he's proud to be a part of the effort to make California's urban and rural communities safer.Reaching down to caress the head of an insistent 7-month-old goat rubbing up against his leg, Choi took in the fire break visible from the bottom of the mountain.""That line right there could save these houses. It could help save lives. It could give firefighters just enough time to save the people in this community,"" he said.Copyright 2023 NPR.

Former Mayor Kim Driscoll stepped away from her fifth term when she was sworn in as Massachusetts’ lieutenant governor in January.Pangallo, who served as former Mayor Kim Driscoll’s chief of staff up until January 2022, said he’s thrilled by the outcome of the preliminary election. He collected more than 40% of the vote, the highest among the candidates, according tounofficial results released by the city.“It’s a pivotal moment for Salem, and I feel strongly that we can’t go backwards,” he told GBH News Wednesday. “We have a strong foundation to build on and keep moving our city forward as a place that works for everyone.”Harrington, who served as Salem’s mayor from 1990 to 1997, did not respond to GBH News’ requests for comment. He took in nearly a third of the vote, per the unofficial tally, and is running on preserving Salem’s economic future as well as keeping Salem’s Peabody Essex Museum from moving to Boston.Pangallo said some of the top issues facing Salem are affordability and housing. He also wants to smooth the transition with new projects coming to the city, making sure that the city benefits from the new jobs an in-development offshore wind terminal while managing the project’s impact on surrounding neighborhoods.Former City Councilor Stephen Dibble finished third with 14% of the vote, acting Mayor and Ward 5 City Councilor Robert McCarthy was fourth with 8%, and activist Stacia Kraft came in fifth with just under 3% at 188 votes.Kraft tells GBH News that she “went into the race with no illusions” and said there are crucial issues that she hopes remain potent for the final election.“We have nine planned developments for our flood zones and Salem is only eight square miles. And we now are moving towards privatizing the Salem Housing Authority,” she said. “So giving over our elderly and disabled residents to for-profit corporations, these are two very big issues.”Kraft was the only candidate without a political background.Pangallo attributes his win in the preliminary election to a strong field campaign, having knocked on almost 5,000 doors. He said that kind of grassroots effort is what helped him win 11 of the 14 precincts in Salem and he hopes will give him victory in May.“I feel like the results in that preliminary election were a strong indication that our community is one that wants to keep moving forward as a place that's innovative and professionally managed.”Campaign finance reports show both Pangallo and Harrington spent tens of thousands of dollars on the race. Pangallo spent nearly $28,000 since the beginning of November, while Harrington spent nearly $46,000. Both Pangallo and Harrington outspent the other candidates at least four times over.As of the end of February, Pangallo had just over $42,000 cash on hand, closely matched by Harrington’s nearly $41,000."

Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners.After crossing the starting line on East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle, then takes Beacon Street into Brookline and through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square.Find recommended spectator spots along GBH News'Boston Marathon route mapbelow. Looking for ways to get here? Open the left menu and check the box next to ""parking and transit"" for suggestions.How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating acertain timeat another major marathon, with qualifying times determined by a runner's gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don’t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September.The other way to run the marathon is as part of thecharity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who’s running the 2023 marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the “fastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.”The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men’s side are:Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who’s taking on Boston for the first timeafter winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon and setting the marathon world record; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men’s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women’s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia’s Atsede Baysa.The women’s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland’s Manuela Schär, who has won Boston four times; Australia’s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times.The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year.How much money do athletes win in the Boston Marathon?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made for the 2023 race?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes.""So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,"" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the “The Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,” told GBH Newswhen the policy was announced in September.""I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work … this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.""In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allowpregnant and postpartum runnerswho qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. “Women who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,” said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA.Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch the Boston Marathon on TV?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Race coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The front runners are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12 p.m., respectively.How can I stream the Boston Marathon?WCVBwill live stream the race on its digital platforms and app. Sister stations WMUR, WMTV and WPTZ will also stream the marathon on their respective digital platforms.A live stream will also be available onVery Local Boston.Streamers can find Very Local in the app store for mobile devices as well as Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV and Samsung TV (2019 and later models).How can I watch the Boston Marathon in person?Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are theScream Tunnel at Wellesley College,Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street.If you’re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day.Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square. Bags will be inspected at these checkpoints, and items likebackpacks and weapons aren't allowed.Officials from Boston Police, Transit Police, State Police, the FBI and more will also be stationed along the route.For more details on watching in person, check out theBAA’s spectator guide.Can I track someone in the race?If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a freeBAA Racing Appthat you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version can be downloaded from theApp Store for iPhone usersorGoogle Play for Android users.How Boston Police are preparing for marathon MondayRegardless of how you get to the race route, expect a police presence and be ready to pass through security checkpoints.Officials from Boston Police, Transit Police, State Police, the FBI and more will be stationed along the route, and there will be checkpoints where spectators will need their bags inspected.Law enforcement leaders also encourage spectators to speak up if they see anything suspicious at this year's Boston Marathon. The FBI said it is not aware of any specific or credible threats to the race, but officials still recommend attendees remain aware.""Check your cellphone settings and make sure that your phone can receive emergency and public safety alerts to ensure that you receive any urgent public safety messages,"" MEMA acting director Dawn Brantley said during an April 13 press conference. ""This is a good idea every day and not just on marathon Monday.""How old is the Boston Marathon?The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest continually run marathon, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year.This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots’ Day — the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots’ Day.This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects forOne Boston Day.What other events will be happening the weekend of the 2023 race?The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay.April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m."

It could also take away significant decision-making from librarians.At a School Committee meeting this week, parents and educators spoke their minds about the proposal foralmost two hours.It was clear from the public comments: both sides showed up to protect their children, their beliefs and their freedom of speech.When parent Bella Soares stepped up to the microphone Tuesday, it wasn't the first time the district had heard from her about school library books she believes are inappropriate for students. That includes an illustrated book about puberty, ""Sex is a Funny Word.”Soares is part of an organized group called Ludlow Concerned Parents, according to a meeting agenda from a 2022 Select Board meeting.The recently proposed library policy echoes Soares’ activism of the last few years.At Tuesday's meeting, she first directed her comments to the parents and educators in the auditorium who disagree with her — who say the proposed policy is exclusionary, arbitrary and discriminatory against students who identify as LGBTQ.""Get this all through your heads,"" Soares said. ""You guys are the ones that are making it [about] LGBTQ. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with pornographic books in our school — drugs, rape, obscenity books. That's what we're trying to eliminate here.""Soares then read a passage aloud from a 2005 coming-of-age novel, John Green's ""Looking for Alaska."" Soares said the book is currently available to Ludlow sixth, seventh and eighth graders.The scene depicts the start and completion of a sexual act between a teenage boy and girl, while they're watching ""The Brady Bunch.""After reading, Soares said, ""So now you tell me if this is not pornography! This is definitely pornography!""That prompted shouts from others the crowd of about 150 people. It was one of several times that night the school committee chair asked people to settle down and follow protocol.It was Ludlow School Committee Member Joao Dias who a few weeks ago proposed the new library materials policy.On Tuesday, along with the rest of the committee, Dias sat at a table at the front of the room. Surrounding him were 10 books books he had taken out from the public library — to make a point.They don't belong on the shelves of a school library, he said, and he proposed the new policy because it's needed.""We've had complaints ongoing for the past six years. I think the chairman himself said that. [And] possible lawsuits from parents,"" Dias said, ""and that's a real thing, and that's based on what's going on now, not what might be from a civil liberties union that doesn't protect any civil liberties.""The ACLU of Massachusetts has called Dias' proposal unlawful and a not-very-veiled attempt to suppress literature about LGBTQ experiences.Dias said he found thepolicyonline, from theCentral Bucks School District in Pennsylvania. The ACLU has challenged that district's policy with a federal lawsuit.The proposed policy in Ludlow would give elected school officials like Dias decision-making powers about materials that couldoverride librarians. Several were at the meeting and said they were not consulted by the school committee.The policy could also lead to the firing of school employees who don't follow the rules or who encourage certain books.The majority of people speaking out at the meeting were against Dias' proposal. One called it a moral crusade; another, a culture war.Mike Kelliher, a parent and former school committee member, said it’s very sad for him to have to address the committee in this way.""This policy originated froma hate group in Pennsylvaniaand somehow managed to find its way onto your agenda,"" he said. ""And I think we need to know how that happened. I hope that's something that will be discussed tonight because that's important. It's important to know who's pulling the strings behind the scenes on some of our committee members.""The rancor brought about by the proposal may cover up that some parents in Ludlow have real concerns their children have access to inappropriate material.Longtime Ludlow teacher Michelle Annecchiarico stood up at the microphone and said she understands that. She herself has questioned certain books available to middle schoolers, and questioned librarians.She's told parents she'll help them do likewise, and help but none have taken her up on the offer.But no one in the schools, Annecchiarico said, is pushing porn on students or trying to sexualize them.""We are up against cell phones, social media, all-access 24/7 TV, YouTube, TikTok, 'Squid Games' ... we have kids who are allowed to watch 'Squid Games!'"" she said.At the meeting, three out of five School Committee members made statements indicating their opposition to Dias’ proposal. Things get heated.Several people said the School Committee failed the district and are getting distracted by the loudest voices.Some came to the meeting to talk about the school budget — and maybe to ask the superintendent about the 25 educators, including a couple of librarians, who are slated to be laid off.That, they said, is what school officials should have been talking about."

The increase comes as the state made a number of changes to the agency tasked with supplier diversity, giving it more teeth to enforce the commonwealth's goals and creating more tools for agencies to see their own progress.Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday touted the increase and told GBH News that her administration is ""committed"" to doing more.""Massachusetts is home to so many incredible, diverse businesses that are the backbone of our communities and economy. We are glad that Massachusetts exceeded our goals for supplier diversity last year, with more minority-owned firms winning state contracts than ever before,"" Healey said in a prepared statement. ""Our administration is committed to building on this progress.""Whether or not the state met its goals depends on what contracts are counted. Gov. Charlie Baker's administration had set a goal for state agencies to hire minority-owned firms for 8% of their contract work. Similar to previous years, the Supplier Diversity Office report indicates that the agencies met that goal, because the report includes more than $230 million the state spent with nonprofits led by predominantly minority board members. But in 2021, GBH Newssurveyed a dozen other statesand found only one — Connecticut — that included payments to nonprofits in its annual count of minority contracting totals.The survey was part of an ongoing GBH News investigation, launched in 2020, calledThe Color of Public Money.Among other findings, the series showed that the value of government contracts won by minority-owned firms in Massachusetts had declined over the past two decades, and that the state had begun counting other expenditures unrelated to state contracts that obscured the shortfall.Substantial changes came in November 2020 whenBaker announcedthat he was elevating the Supplier Diversity Office into a standalone agency, giving it new authority and resources to force other state agencies to meet contracting goals. The change also created a new reporting system that distinguishes nonprofit spending from contracts with private businesses.The new office has allowed for much greater transparency around what the state has achieved. More detailed breakdowns reveal that Black businesses have benefitted more than other groups from the state’s new effort to work with diverse contractors — an effort motivated partly by the racial reckoning that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd.For example, in fiscal year 2020, Black-owned businesses won only $11 million in state contracts. Last year, that number rose to $76 million. Hispanic-owned firms saw their share of state contracts rise from $12 million in 2020 to $28 million last year. For Asian American firms, the total rose from $71 million in 2020 to $110 million last year.Reorganizing the Supplier Diversity Office also led to the creation of a compliance unit that would check and confirm statewide contractors’ claims that they had partnered with diverse firms. Companies getting state contracts are generally directed to meet goals for including minority-owned partners in the work, and they are required to submit reports on their spending. The office said that about one-third of the reports they examined were incorrect, but half of those errors were understating the amount spent with a minority partner, while the other half overstated it. The final totals included in the annual report reflect the corrected amounts.The state also launched a new online portal where agencies can track their own progress — and their contractors' progress — toward meeting the minority inclusion goals, and connect with certified minority-owned firms that are available to take on work.Nicole Obi, president and chief executive of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, said her group will be closely monitoring the state's effort. The council was a leading advocate of Baker's 2020 strengthening of the Supplier Diversity Office.""While we are pleased that there has been some progress, there is still a significant amount of improvement to be made in eliminating barriers and ensuring that the state is held accountable for realizing its procurement goals with Black and other diverse businesses,"" Obi said. ""Without transparency on goal-setting and accountability for implementing the necessary changes, the commonwealth will continue to fall short on equitable procurement.""Peter Hurst, who heads the Greater New England Minority Supplier Development Council, agreed new data shows a ""positive trend."" But he too wants to see more improvements. Part of the problem, he says, is that it's not the Supplier Diversity Office who makes the final procurement decision. Those choices lie with the individual state agencies.""If you really want to see those numbers improved dramatically so that you're exceeding the goal instead of chasing the goal, what you need to do is push down accountability to the person who's actually making that procurement decision.""Hurst said that some of the work involves a change of mindset. He said people generally think of minority-owned businesses as small companies with limited capacity to fulfill large contracts. But in Massachusetts, he said, there are numerous minority-owned businesses with significant revenues and the capacity to not only fulfill government contracts, but also to mentor smaller firms. He said his council has identified about 150 minority businesses that, together, take in $1.6 billion in revenue.Helping minority-owned businesses grow is not just an ethical imperative, Hurst said, but it is also the key to economic growth statewide.""If you can do anything to help reduce the racial wealth gap by supporting minority business development, it inures to the benefit of everyone in the state — Black, white, brown, rich, poor. You know, it makes the economy stronger,"" he said. ""Anything that makes the economy stronger, we all should be supporting."""

Sure, you’vebanned booksby Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation.The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.”As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — becausetodayis rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl,both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans.My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstarLeBron Jamestoppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history."

Lydia Shiu of Reservoir Church in Cambridge evoked an enduring metaphor — that of David taking on the giant Goliath in the Bible — as she spoke of the commonwealth's housing challenges.Shiu helped lead a Greater Boston Interfaith Organization rally Thursday, where the coalition of religious groups and unions called on state leaders to make housing more affordable and accessible. She said the “GBIO sling” had secured past policy wins in health care and criminal justice reform.“This is not just a housing crisis. This is a human crisis,” Shiu said. “And although the housing crisis purports itself to be a complex and complicated problem — and yes, folks, it is a hairy one — but in the face of Goliath, you cannot mess with the faith and hope of David.”With its members clad in blue T-shirts, playing trombones, and holding signs with slogans like “Praying with Our Feet,” GBIO launched a new housing justice campaign. The campaign pushes for greater state investment in public housing, zoning reforms to encourage multifamily housing in suburbs, and housing support for formerly incarcerated people.GBIO also backs legislation that would let communities impose a new fee on certain real estate transactions, with proceeds goingtoward affordable housing. Under thebills,filed by Cambridge Rep. Mike Connollyand NorthamptonSen. Jo Comerford, cities and towns that opt in could impose a fee of between 0.5% and 2% of the purchase price on some property sales.Municipalities could choose whether the seller or buyer pays the fee, or split it between the two. The fee would kick in only above a certain price threshold: either $1 million, or above the county's median sale price for single-family homes.Communities including Boston, Somervile, Arlington and Nantucket have sought Beacon Hill's permission to establish transfer taxes in the past, but the concept has faced opposition for years from real estate industry officials, who argue the additional fee would raise costs for buyers.Phil Hillman, a strategy leader at GBIO and member of St. Paul A.M.E. Church, said the interfaith organization supports transfer tax legislation because it knows new revenue sources will be necessary before communities can create more affordable housing.""I have seen the impact of this housing crisis on my Dorchester community. This is a type of crisis that has touched family members, friends, coworkers [and] congregations,"" he said. ""For decades, our housing production has not kept up with our job growth. This has resulted in skyrocketing rents, huge increases in housing prices. If you are low-income — lower middle income — the dream of homeownership has become a nightmare.""After rallying outside the State House, GBIO members planned to meet with lawmakers and staff, asking them to support the bills and funding requests that make up the organization’s housing justice campaign.The organization wants lawmakers to double the amount of money Gov. Maura Healey proposed for public housing in her budget proposal. Healey's budget funds the public housing authorities' account at $92 million for next year, the same amount that was in this year's budget.At Thursday's rally, Arlene Hill described what it meant for her to move into public housing after spending time at a homeless shelter.“The ability to lock that door and be in my apartment, with no one telling me I had to do this or that, saved my life,” she said.GBIO said it will move forward with several action items, and that its members plan to attend committee hearings as lawmakers vet the bills on their agenda."

Legaspi says nodding toward the street where Jun was murdered.Oakland detectives released security camera footage and the license plate number of the suspected get-away car. Anabo's family believes the suspect is a man who sold Anabo a truck that turned out to be stolen. Still, there's been no break in the case and no word.""It's definitely frustrating. Justice hasn't been served,"" Legaspi says. ""I mean it's almost a year. I would like to know something. I don't get no answers,"" he says noting that he and his family haven't heard from Oakland homicide detectives for months. ""You know, if there's anything, you know, even if they didn't do anything, that'd be nice to know. Instead of us hoping.""The U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized worldLegaspi's frustration and pain are shared by hundreds of families of murder victims in Oakland – and across the country – whose cases remain unsolved.While the rate at which murders are solved or ""cleared"" has been declining for decades, it has now dropped to slightly below 50% in 2020 - a new historic low. And several big cities, including Chicago, have seen the number of murder cases resulting in at least one arrest dip into the low to mid-30% range.""We saw a sharp drop in the national clearance rate in 2020,"" says Prof. Philip  Cook, a public policy researcher and professor emeritus at Duke University  and the University of Chicago Urban Labs who has been studying clearance rates for decades. ""It reached close to 50% at that time nationwide, which was the lowest ever recorded by the FBI. And it hasn't come up that much since then.""That makes the U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized world. Germany, for example, consistently clears well over 90% of its murders.While reasons behind the drop are multi-faceted, Cook and other experts warn that more people getting away with murder in the the U.S. is driving a kind of doom loop of mutual mistrust: low murder clearance rates impede future investigations which in turn potentially drive up killings in some communities where a lack of arrests undermines deterrence and sends a message that the police will not or cannot protect them.""Communities that are especially impacted by gun violence believe that the police are ineffective or indifferent, and as a result, they're less willing to cooperate and provide information the police need to have successful investigations,"" says Cook, who has several research articles on the topic coming out.""It is undermining whatever trust there is in the police. And it's a vicious circle,"" Cook says.""I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder""Oakland, Calif., is a prime example of that vicious circle. The city's per capita homicide rate remains abnormally high and its murder solve rate is among the lowest in the nation, hitting just 36% last year. If you take out the handful of older, ""cold"" cases that were solved during 2022, the clearance rate in Oakland just 27%, an analysis by the S.F. Chronicle shows.""Well, I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder. These cases are never closed,"" says Drennon Lindsey, an Oakland deputy chief who formerly led the department's homicide division. ""We never give up, you know. And I also think we can only get better.""Lindsey says the veterans among her 16 detectives are often handing two dozen or more cases at a time, far above the federal recommendation that detectives carry an average of only four to six new homicide cases per year.In addition, she says, an antiquated case management data system, which the city is working to replace, is another reason behind the painfully low clearance rate. But the biggest one, she says, is too many people are scared to talk with and help the OPD.""People don't want to cooperate, people don't want to come to court and testify. And they're afraid of retaliation, of being labeled in their communities as a ""snitch."" And we're often left trying to plea and beg for the community to come forward with information to hold this person accountable for committing murder,"" she says.But that mistrust is also bred by the department's chronic dysfunction.The department remains under federal oversight and has for two decades. In that time the troubled agency has gone through a dozen leaders. And recently veteran Oakland homicide detective Phong Tran was arrested and arraigned after the Alameda County district attorney's office accused him of paying a witness thousands of dollars to lie in a murder case that resulted in two men getting life sentences. Detective Tran faces felony charges of perjury and bribery. Those two murder convictions have been tossed out.In a statement to NPR, Tran's attorney Andrew M. Ganz called the charges ""baseless"" and lashed out a District Attorney Pamela Price for treating ""murderers like heroes.""Price's office in a statement says it is now reviewing at least 125 murders Tran investigated ""to see if we have wrongfully convicted anyone else.""""Lying and manipulating a witness are serious violations of the public trust and a threat to the integrity of the judicial system,"" Price says. ""When the integrity of a conviction is at issue in one case, it raises questions in every other case that the detective has investigated.""The ""exceptional means"" clause and chronic police staffing affect murder clearance ratesThe FBI defines a murder ""cleared"" if a suspect has been identified and arrested. But a murder can also be declared cleared through what's known as an ""exceptional means."" For example, if a suspect is dead, can't be extradited or prosecutors refuse to press charges.So, criminologists note, even some cities now touting modestly improved murder clearance rates, such as Chicago, are really just artificially boosting their clearance numbers through that ""exceptional means"" clause.The arrest rate per murder if is often a better indicator of how police departments are actually doing at holding killers accountable. Prof. Cook's research, for example, shows that from 2016 to 2020 the percentage of murders in Chicago with any type of weapon resulting in at least one arrest was just 33%. And in Durham, North Carolina, between 2017 and 2021 just 41% of gun homicide cases resulted in at least one arrest.Other reasons for the further decline in murder clearance rates, experts say, include chronic police staffing and recruiting problems, and the fact that more murders are committed with firearms, which can result in fewer witnesses and less physical evidence. In addition, judges, prosecutors and juries have higher evidence and procedure standards than in the 1960s when 90-plus%  of homicides were listed as solved.Researchers say key ways cities can to try to stop the downward spiral is simply investing more in homicide investigations: improving crime labs, training, DNA testing, computer modeling systems.White crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killingIn front yard of Oakland's Saint Columba Catholic Church along bustling San Pablo Ave, a garden of simple, wooden, white crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killing.Every Jan. 1 ""that garden is a garden for about a minute,"" says Fr.

I just do the work.”After nearly six decades, Miller says it’s time for someone new to take over his life’s work: the Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspaper. Miller announced Wednesday he is handing the paper over to new owners as part of a larger expansion and redesign of the publication.The new owners, Ron Mitchell and Andre Stark, are veteran journalists with close ties to their Boston communities and long-standing family relationships with 88-year-old Miller, a Roxbury native.“We’re journalists, we’re filmmakers, but we’re also people who have been telling the truth about our community,” Mitchell said. “We’re going to take [The Banner] into the next half a century. We’re going to transition it in many different ways to make it more amenable to a younger audience.”Mitchell, 61, who previously worked at GBH News, resigned last week from a nearly 30-year career at WBZ-TV to prepare for his role as publisher and editor of the Banner, a return to his roots. Mitchell’s family — including his aunt Jean McGuire, a former METCO director — had generations of ties to the Miller family.“We are living up to the responsibility that our families birthed us into,” Mitchell said, “to take responsibility for the communication in our community.”Stark, 63, who will serve as the paper’s chief operating officer, is another GBH veteran who produced documentary films for PBS documentary series Frontline and NOVA. He serves as a board member at the Roxbury-based Center for Teen Empowerment, a nonprofit that provides resources to young people from local communities of color.Stark says he read the Banner as a child, the son of West-Indian parents who steeped him in Black cultural history and enrolled him in school at the Freedom House established by Otto and Muriel Snowden. His mother, a close friend of Miller’s, brought Stark to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s march from his Roxbury neighborhood to the Boston Common in 1965.“I think one of the reasons Mel felt comfortable transferring the mantle over to us is that he knows both of our families,” Stark said. “It helps close the circle as he knows both of us from years ago.”Kenneth Cooper, another GBH News veteran with decades of experience at newsrooms including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Dispatch, will join the Banner as an editorial consultant, overseeing a major expansion and transformation that lies ahead. Longtime Banner senior editor Yawu Miller has agreed to stay on (despite his uncle's departure) to manage the Boston edition of the paper.Financing for the transition came from private contributions from community members around Greater Boston and the Mill Cities Community Investment, a community development financial institution based in Lawrence. Both Miller and the new owners declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.Within the next year, the Banner plans to distribute in other regional markets, including Connecticut, Rhode Island and Northern parts of Massachusetts, and positions will open for bureau chiefs in those areas, Mitchell said. The change of guard comes with plans for a new website and app, weekly 30-minute investigative news shows, wider coverage of sports and local business briefs. The expansion of online content will be overseen by Colin Redd, a 30-year-old Boston native who helps run Blavity, a Black-owned media company with an understanding of young audiences.The new website will include community services including access to loan applications, scholarships, a calendar of community events and other educational resources, Mitchell said.“It’s going to be an interactive resource, a portal of opportunities,” Mitchell said. “The website will be true community outreach, not just a physical rendition of the paper.”The goal, Mitchell says, is to reach new audiences and expand coverage while preserving the publication’s integrity as a source of local news for communities of color.“This is an extension of African-American culture going back hundreds of years, community storytelling that transformed into Black publishing,” Mitchell said. “Dating back to emancipation, Black papers told the truth about the Black community.”The Banner has always stood out as a source of straightforward information, Mitchell says, representing an on-the-ground approach to issues directly impacting communities of color.“The Black community is not a monolith,” he said. “That's why it is important to have a paper that understands the complexity of our community and tells us that's the only way you get the true story.”Miller founded the Banner in 1965 to fill a void left by the folding of The Guardian, a newspaper led by civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter. His goal was never objectivity — an idea he dismisses as “nonsense” — but to be fair and honest, and to help readers understand “the complexity of American society” with nuance and clarity.“People would come up to me sometimes and ask me why we didn’t cover some shooting, and I said, 'Hey, there are many places you can find that,'” Miller said. “I’m not going to spend ten cents of my budget giving any attention to a brutal government. Not going to happen.”Miller’s hope for the paper is the continuation of his work highlighting the fabric of life in communities of color, emphasizing “positive, helpful and uplifting” coverage whenever possible.“If we focus on the wrong things perpetually, then what we're doing is we are building that culture around those ideas, on the ugly angels,” Miller said. “I like to appeal to people’s beautiful angels.”"

Bill supporters said that leaves families to navigate a complicated patchwork of safety net programs that have limits on coverage for some services like mental health, dental care or prescription drugs, and do not cover others, like eyeglasses or home health care.Chelsea resident Ruth Gomez told the committee that she and her family came here from Honduras to seek a better life for her son Dylan, who was born without eyes, is mostly deaf, and has severe developmental disabilities and limited mobility.Speaking in Spanish with an interpreter, Gomez said the limited insurance Dylan initially had didn’t cover much of what he needed, including walking aids, hearing aids, behavioral therapies and tests recommended by doctors. When the family received a new immigration status this year and Dylan could get standard MassHealth, it “made a world of difference,” she said.“Before, feeding him used to be very stressful for me because I was was so fearful he would choke every time,” Gomez said, “Now, with the new health coverage, we have access to a treatment which helps him swallow with more ease, allowing Dylan to eat solid foods and have better nutrition.”Covering more than 2 million people, the state Medicaid program MassHealth is the single largest piece of the state budget.In this year's roughly $56 billion budget, still under negotiation between the House and Senate, lawmakers are eyeing a funding level somewhere around $20 billion, much of which would be reimbursed by the federal government.The bill pending before the committee would direct state health officials to ""maximize federal financial participation for the benefits"" that would be extended to previously ineligible children, but says that the benefits shouldn't be conditioned on whether federal money is available.Similar bills have been filed on Beacon Hill multiple times over the years, but legislative leaders have never brought them to a floor for a vote.This year’s push comes as the state Senate is alsoseeking a law changethat would let Massachusetts high school graduates without legal immigration status pay the lower, in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities, and as the state’s shelter systemstruggled to meet demandamid an influx of migrants.Amy Grunder of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition said many of the new arrivals are families with young children.She said some newly arriving immigrant children, such as Haitians and Venezuelans participating in an immigration parole process, are able to access comprehensive medical coverage, while others, including asylum seekers, cannot. An asylum claim can take months, assuming a pro bono lawyer is even available, Grunder said.“These children often need access to mental health services as well after undergoing the trauma of a harrowing journey of months or in some cases years to get here,” she said.Twelve other states already have similar laws on their books, according to Health Care for All, including Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island and Maine.Casey Thompson, an assistant attorney general in AG Andrea Campbell’s children’s justice unit, said there are between 30,000 and 48,000 children and young adults in Massachusetts whose only barrier for insurance eligibility is their immigration status.Thompson said her office hasn’t done a formal cost-benefit analysis putting a price tag on the proposed change.“We believe that there is a cost here to doing nothing – in the form of financial [costs], with regard to having kids be forced into having more inpatient stays, more hospitalization visits, and chronic conditions in the long-term,” she said. “But we also believe there’s a non-financial cost here, when you look at the parents, the families of these children and young adults as well as the children and young adults themselves, in terms of their life and well-being, and we believe that deserves due consideration in a cost-benefit analysis as well.”"

Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that she will seek a third term in 2024.Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a failed 2020 presidential contender, said she's running for reelection to end corruption in Washington, make the economy work for the middle class and protect democracy.""I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the rich and powerful and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it, too. And now I'm running for Senate again because there's a lot more we've got to do,"" Warren said in a campaign video released Monday.Warren, 73, had more than $2.3 million in her campaign account at the end of 2022, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Warren first won election to the seat in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected to fill out the term of Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009.With the win, the then-Harvard Law School professor became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.In 2018, Warren won a second term, easily defeating Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, before quickly setting her sights on the presidency.While popular among some Democratic voters for her blunt rhetoric, Warren was unable to break away from the party's pack of contenders and dropped out after failing to win any of the states that voted on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in the Democratic primary in her home state.During the campaign against Brown and again during her bid for the presidency, Warren was dogged by past claims of Native American heritage and her inability to provide documentation of that ancestry.That led then-President Donald Trump to go after her early in the presidential campaign, derisively labeling her ""Pocahontas."" Warren had said she learned of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes from stories told by her parents.After the 2020 loss, Warren continued her focus on the financial sector.Warren recently joined California Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, to push a proposal to repeal a 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The bill, part of discussions in Congress following the recent abrupt failure of two banks, is unlikely to advance.In her campaign video, Warren ticked off a series of priorities from passing a wealth tax and putting stricter rules on banks to making child care more affordable, protecting coastal communities and building what she called ""a 21st century transportation system across all of Massachusetts.""It's unclear who might challenge Warren for the Senate seat. Many Democrats appeared to be waiting until Warren or fellow Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, also a Democrat, decided not to seek reelection. Markey in 2020 fended off a primary challenge from then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy.The state's Republican Party is trying to rebuild after losing the governor's office last year when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker opted not to seek a third term and Democrat Maura Healey handily defeated GOP candidate Geoff Diehl.Warren already has the backing of many high-profile Massachusetts Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Markey.Warren serves on several congressional committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Armed Services."

But in recent years, it’s the farm’s goats who have stepped into the limelight as part of an agricultural trend emerging across New England.“In the early 2000s, we started going goat crazy,” said Michelle Aulson, who owns the farm in Georgetown with more than 200 animals. “Black brush and poison ivy control with all the goats.”Eventually, she said, the farm’s goat enthusiasm evolved into a business, Goats To Go. Known as “goat scaping,” it’s a way of managing vegetation that dates back thousands of years. Particularly for areas in Massachusetts where the ecosystems are more fragile, using goats instead of chemicals lets property owners remove invasive vegetation without harming the environment. And for the people who run the farms, they say they can’t keep up with the interest in renting out their goats.“There’s so many problems with pesticide usage and other things, and it’s a natural way of getting rid of vegetation,” Aulson said. “And it’s also fun to watch them do it.”Aulson transports her goats to cemeteries, parks and schools to clear brush.“Here in the Northeast, you've got urban settings. We've done a lot of dog parks. We've done ... a National Park service in Lowell. We've gone out there on their hillsides to maintain their vegetation.”According to the USDA’s most recent census figures, Massachusetts is home to 670 goat and sheep farmswith $2.3 million in yearly sales.John Bennett, who bears the title of “chief goat officer” at Goats of Dover, startedhis businesswith three goats during the pandemic after he was laid off from his advertising job. He offers “cocktails with goats” and Zoom meetings with goats, too, but today, his company’s primary service is goat scaping.“And goats, thankfully, love most of the invasive species out there: dense, woody material like poison ivy, bittersweet and buckthorn and things like that,” Bennett said. “One of the main reasons we started is concern over the environment — and the fact that this is what goats were basically born to do is eat stuff like this, right? So why not put their talent to use in a way that's good for the goat and good for the environment.”Since 2015, Stacey Greaves has owned Goat Green Cape Cod, and she rents out her goats for landscape management. Given Cape Cod’s sensitive water aquifer, she says goat grazing is a smart way to approach landscape maintenance.There’s a lot of demand for her services; last year, she was staring down a waiting list of more than 50 potential customers, she said. But she’s hit a hurdle in growing her business: hiring more workers. Greaves says it’s difficult to find employees who are willing to take on part-time, seasonal work.“We need to start taking care of the land. And I just introduced the idea on the Cape,” Greaves said. “There's many, many goat scaping companies across the country, across the world. But it was new here to Cape Cod.”Landscape designer Laura Kelley of Littlefield Landscapes in North Eastham is familiar with environmentally sensitive areas like Cape Cod.“Goats are an incredible method and all-natural way to maintain our properties, and in a way that does not include any sort of toxic chemicals. And so, it's an absolute great way to have animals eat your problems away,” Kelley said.At the Carroll School in Lincoln, Wayland and Waltham, the grounds sometimes battle invasive species, like poison ivy and Japanese knot wood. Danielle Pedreira, the school’s facilities and capital projects director, has hired Goats To Go for years because the Waltham campus abuts wetlands and the reservoir that holds Cambridge’s drinking water.“And because we're in that buffer zone of the wetlands, we can't use any sort of chemicals or tools to try and remove the poison ivy or treat it,” Pedreira said.The goats themselves are pretty low maintenance, their farmers say. Bennett, with Goats of Dover, said the first step on a new job is to assess the property. While the goats aren’t picky eaters, there are a few plants they cannot eat, like rhododendron and milkweed, both of which can cause the animals harm.“We’ll do a site survey where we really walk every square foot of the land that the goats are going to be on to identify any harmful plants and to take measurements and things like that,” Bennett said. “Then we provide an estimate.”The cost can vary, depending on the size of the area and how long it takes the goats to clear the land. Different farmers said it could cost as little as $1,200 for a small penned-in area, while another started at $2,200 for a quarter acre. It may be more costly than pesticides but, to some, it’s worth it to use a more sustainable practice.After the assessment, the goat scaping company will erect a fence around the area where the goats will munch for a few days — up to a couple of weeks for a big job like a national park.Although goat scaping isn't always a permanent fix, farmers like Aulson say the animals come pretty close to controlling regrowth of invasive species the natural way.“They do fertilize,” said Aulson, who runs Great Rock Farm. “But the fertilization with a goat ... they don't re-germinate, which means their stomachs break down everything that's in there. And therefore when they poop out the other end, they're not re-seeding everything.”She said the region’s goat farmers help one another, too. Her farm helps others get into the business of goat scaping by running workshops, too, to teach farmers about the vegetation to keep an eye out for and the equipment that they’ll need — even selling them goats.“We are always trying to help other people get business,” she said. “We know the model.”Goat scaping isn’t a practice that’s regulated at the state level, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. Bennett says the rules with goat scaping vary by community, but he says he doesn’t run into problems with his farming practices.“Neighbors can’t complain about odor or noise as long as you’re doing things that you’re supposed to do,” Bennett said. “They love it. I mean, there's not a lot of things that are cuter than baby goats, believe me.”"

Tanoshi and his parents, Hiromi and Chikao, joinedAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath to spell out his victory.Arun Rath:Tanoshi, you must have studied very hard for this. Tell us how you felt when you realized you were the winner.Tanoshi Inomata:I was surprised that I was the big champion because even though I practice a lot every day, I never thought I could. Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn’t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them.Rath:Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi:My championship word was ‘ancho.’Rath:How do you spell that?Tanoshi:You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath:I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi:It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers.Rath:Oh, right! That’s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right? What was your sense of it?Tanoshi:I was pretty confident because even though when I first practiced, I got it wrong. But then I started practicing it and I got it right.Rath:That’s brilliant. Congratulations!Tanoshi:Thank you.Rath:I didn’t realize this, but apparently, only one other person from Massachusetts has won the national spelling bee. That was over 80 years ago. How do you feel about it?Tanoshi:I feel like now I want to win the national spelling bee and show off to everyone.Rath:Are you feeling confident?Tanoshi:Yeah. Now I’m practicing two times a day. I’m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath:Tanoshi, I’m curious, what’s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi:Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath:And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi:Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It’s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he’ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I’m sure I’ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi:Me, too!Rath:It sounds like you have a good time together. That’s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi:I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year.Rath:Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:That’s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.?Tanoshi:Yeah. And I’m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath:So you’ll be heading to Washington in May. Are you going to be practicing every day between now and then?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:Do you have a favorite word to spell?Tanoshi:I like to spell long words. For example, tintinnabulary.Rath:Tintinnabulary has to do with a ringing of bells?Tanoshi:Yeah.Rath:Can you spell that out for me, if you don’t mind showing off?Tanoshi:T-I-N-T-I-N-N-A-B-U-L-A-R-Y. Tintinnabulary.Rath:Brilliant. We’re so happy that you’re going to nationals and representing us. Good luck! We can’t wait to hear how it goes.Tanoshi:Oh, actually, I have one more thing.

""So now the character alludes to Xi Jinping himself and the president doesn't like this.""Pulled with no explanation from Hong Kong and MacauWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, written and directed by British filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield, has become something of an internet sensation, exceeding all expectations with releases across Latin America and Asia. It was scheduled to start screening at more than 30 cinemas in Hong Kong and Macau on Thursday, but the distributor said all showings have been called off.Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey will be canceled in Hong Kong and Macau, VII Pillars Entertainment said in a statement on Facebook.The company added that the film ""failed to meet the audience"" and asked for the public's forgiveness. They offered no additional explanation and company officials did not respond to NPR's questions.How Winnie the Pooh became a subversive symbolThe last minute removal from theaters marks the second time that the release of  a Winnie-the-Pooh-based film has been blocked in China. But why?The connection between Chinese leader Xi and Pooh can be traced back to 2013, when people on social media compared a photo of Xi and former President Barack Obama walking side by side to an image of Pooh and Tigger. The meme took off and for several years, government critics appropriated the character to make fun of Xi or lambaste his policies.That prompted Beijing to censor the Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh and animated gifs of the chubby, somewhat dopey bear on social media platforms in 2017.The University of Georgia's Han explained that it's not Pooh that's objectionable to Xi and the authoritarian regime, but the fact that critics are using the bear as a stand-in to denounce the government's policies.That's why, he says, ""the censorship machine"" is constantly looking for perceived criticism, which often takes the form of seemingly benign images, coded plays on words, or no words at all. For instance, in November in a rare show of public protest, Chinese dissidents marched through the streets holding up blank sheets of paper, sending a silent message of defiance to the authorities.Han noted that images or objects with Pooh's likeness are still permitted in China, but online is a different story. ""Anywhere that online dissident groups are mobilizing, that's what triggers the nerve of this state,"" he said.Given the history with the character, Han said he is surprised that the film got past the Chinese government's censorship system in the first place. Domestic and foreign films are all subjected to a strict pre-publication review system, and the government retains the right to ban any film that doesn't comply from being shown in theaters — or even from streaming online — within the country.Other challenges included quota on foreign filmsMichael Berry, director for the University of California Los Angeles Center for Chinese Studies, told NPR that a film like Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey would be up against a number of hurdles regardless of the Xi connection.""Firstly there is a quota system in China that strictly limits the number of foreign films distributed; because of this quota, most studios submit big tentpole films like Marvel and DC superhero movies or big-budget war films. Smaller films often have trouble getting access to the market,"" Berry said.The UCLA professor also noted that China doesn't usually welcome horror films because the country has no rating system. The thinking is that all films should technically be suitable for general audiences. ""That provides inherent challenges when it comes to the horror genre,"" he said.For now, audiences in Hong Kong and Macau will have to wait for the possibility of watching a bloodthirsty Winne the Pooh.But as one would-be fan remarked, it may be coming to a streaming service near you.

But the country was once on the path to accepting a nuclear society in the 1970s. President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Atoms for Peace program in 1953 and played a significant role in the development of nuclear energy.“We wouldn’t even be talking about climate change [today] because other countries would have followed. France followed us very closely, Sweden followed us, and Russia. They were all doing this [developing nuclear energy] in the 1970s,” Stone argued.But fear of nuclear may be changing. After a showing of his film, Stone recalled that young people came up to him to say that his work moved them and inspired them to want to take action.“They’re not as scared of nuclear war, which was a big issue in the ’50s and ’60s,” he said. “They’re less scared of that than climate change. And that’s important.”Despite the negative connotations, he says nuclear power is “nature’s gift” — and much safer than alternatives like coal, gas and oil. Many of the scientists featured in his documentary have a similarly positive view of nuclear energy, which currently generatesnearly 20%of the electricity in the United States.“On the list of deaths when you check the chart in the film, nuclear is at the bottom,” Stone said. “There’s nothing compared to it.”"

Maura Healey said in a written statement. “Our administration is proud to partner with the MIRA Coalition on the newly created Immigrant Assistance Services program and to provide additional funding to these organizations to support the important work they do for our communities.”The MIRA Coalition, New England’s largest immigrant rights nonprofit, will soon sub-grant out the funding to other organizations. Beneficiaries include the International Institute of New England, the Brazilian Workers Center, Boston Health Care for the Homeless, Jewish Family Service of Western Massachusetts, La Colaborativa in Chelsea and the Justice Center of Southeast Massachusetts.Liz Sweet, executive director of the MIRA Coalition, told GBH News that the funding will help families currently eligible for state emergency shelter enroll in benefits, schools and child care programs.“We’re really looking forward to seeing these organizations receive funding for work that they often have been doing, but sometimes with really minimal resources,” she said. “Housing certainly is a real challenge here in Massachusetts.""The International Institute of New England says it will be providing training and support around case management.“Whatthe Institute is doing specifically is creating and training other providers on best practices in case management and building out a database and data system for all of the providers,” said Alexandra Weber, a senior vice president for the organization. She said they hope this will help organizations track and keep better records related to immigrant needs and what is provided.Some providers told GBH News that the state funding is appreciated — but not nearly enough to meet the need.The Immigrant Family Services Institute, based in Mattapan, is receiving almost $65,000 to aid its efforts in helping Haitian migrants. But Executive Director Geralde Gabeau says this money is only a “drop in the ocean” for the thousands of immigrants they seek to help each month.“Being the organization serving the largest Haitian group of new immigrants and having five different offices across the state, $64,000 is not even one week’s worth of payroll for us,” she said.Gabeau says her organization has what it calls a “one-stop-shop” for helping parents enroll their children in school, take English and computer classes, and find employment, housing, and work authorization.Gabeau estimates helping each person costs the organization at least $1,200.In May alone, she said, the organization assisted 4,000 Haitians arriving in Massachusetts, some from the border with humanitarian parole, seeking asylum, as well as people coming from other states.Many Haitians have recently found shelter in theemergency room lobbyof Boston Medical Center, and rely on a network of nonprofits to create piecemeal temporary housing.

But when I saw that there was very little wildlife because it had been culled during the President Idi Amin era, I thought that I should become a veterinarian who works with wildlife.I’d grown up with so many pets at home, and I really wanted to be a vet by the age of two. But by the age of 18, I felt like I wanted to be a vet that works with wildlife. Then, I got an opportunity to work with captive chimpanzees, and then I also got to work with chimpanzees in the wild and, finally, with mountain gorillas in the national park, one year after gorilla tourism had just begun. And I became Uganda’s first wildlife vet.Rath:Tell us a bit more about your first encounter with gorillas and how you came to become enamored with these animals.Kalema-Zikusoka:My first encounter with gorillas was really exciting. First of all, it took me a week before I could see them because I developed a nasty cold. But once I got better, we went to visit them, and that day we only saw one gorilla. We could be within five meters of distance with him.I looked into his eyes, and it was a really deep connection. They’re very intelligent. I felt that they were so vulnerable, and we need to do something to protect them. At that time, there were so few left in the world, and that made me feel like I wanted to be a full-time wildlife veterinarian because I felt we needed to do something to prevent them from going extinct.Rath:It’s interesting because Uganda has such fantastic natural beauty and wildlife, but you just reminded me in this conversation that we’re talking about the post-Idi Amin period when the wildlife had not been taken care of. Talk about what the situation was and how the country had recovered in terms of the natural landscape.Kalema-Zikusoka:During the Idi Amin era, the president himself was hunting elephants in the national parks. The national parks were supposed to be a safe haven for wildlife. The wardens tried to stop it, but eventually, they couldn’t anymore, so elephant poaching went up. Later, when the army overthrew Idi Amin, some of the soldiers also ate meat from the forests and the national parks, soa lot of numbers went down,and the elephants and rhinos were pushed to extinction.Then, in 1987, mountain gorillas were discovered. They thought the only population was in the Virunga Mountains, but suddenly, in ‘87, after doing genetic studies, they found out that there is a second population. Having seen how Rwanda was benefiting from mountain gorilla tourism, Uganda started to habituate them, and a few years later, tourism began.That completely transformed the situation in Uganda because gorilla tourism is now raising so much revenue that some of it was going to support the other national parks that don’t get enough tourists because they don’t have enough wildlife or it’s not easy to get to the wildlife. It really transformed the landscape.When I first started working with gorillas, there were only two groups habituated for tourism. Now, there’s 22 groups. So at any one time, you can have almost 180 people in the park, whereas before, there were only 12 people.It’s transformed people’s lives. Most people employed by the park are from the local communities, and we are also engaging them in our nonprofit, so it’s really transforming the whole area.Rath:My next question was going to be about how your NGO, Conservation Through Public Health, and how public health ties into wildlife conservation. But I feel like you gave us a bit of a preview on that. Talk about that some more.Kalema-Zikusoka:Actually, one of the very first cases I had to deal with as Uganda’s first wildlife vet working for the national parks, which later became the Uganda Wildlife Authority, was a skin disease outbreak on the then-critically endangered mountain gorillas. They called me and said the gorillas are developing white, scaly skin. So I wondered what it could be, and a human doctor friend of mine told me the most common skin disease in people is scabies.So I went with a drug called ivermectin, which is very good for any parasites. When we got there, it turned out to be scabies. The baby gorilla had sadly died, but the others recovered with treatment. Their hair started to grow back and stop scratching.We started asking ourselves, “Where could this have come from?” The two groups habituated for tourism was spending a lot of time outside the national park because their habitat had been cut down, and they were always going out to look for banana plants. It had been cut down because of the high human population density. We found that those people were very poor and they had very little health care. When we met with them, they said they wanted to improve the situation because they don’t want to make the gorillas sick, and they wanted to be more healthy and have better well-being.This made me realize you can’t protect the gorillas and their habitat without improving the health and well-being of the people who they share their fragile habitats with. A few years later, we founded Conservation Through Public Health.I did research looking at tuberculosis in people, wildlife and livestock, and I understood how the public health system works in Uganda. All of this information helped us to found Conversation Through Public Health.Rath:As I mentioned at the top, it seems like most of what we hear about wildlife and conservation is typically bad or terrible news — almost panicking. It’s nice to be able to talk to you about hopeful stories like this, about how wildlife can rebound. Can I ask you for any additional hope? Are there ways in which what you’ve accomplished in Uganda could apply in other places? Are there other ways that we could do what you’ve been able to pull off there?Kalema-Zikusoka:Actually, we have found that as the health of the community is improving, people are not poaching as much. We show them that we care about them and their health, which is a basic human right, and not only about the wildlife and the forests. We’re very excited about that.Tourism has also helped. Communities are much happier. I’ll say that there are other countries in Africa where the numbers of gorilla species are going down, but the mountain gorilla population has almost doubled over the past 25 years and is still growing, which is exciting.In other countries in Africa, where there are no community benefits, there isn’t much support for communities — there’s still a lot of hunting. This particular model could really work, and it could also work in other areas with other wildlife.I’ve actually been speaking at the Wilson Center today, and the very question they asked was like this. They said, “We would love to scale up our approach to other parts of the world.”"

Sure, you’vebanned booksby Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation.The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.”As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — becausetodayis rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl,both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans.My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstarLeBron Jamestoppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history."

Here's what you need to know about the decades-long debate over affirmative action and the potential effects of the court's decision.What’s at stake?The case could upend 40 years of legal precedent and fundamentally alter the landscape of higher education by making race considerations in college admissions illegal.Decades ago, colleges began considering race as one factor among many in the admissions process as a way to help remediate past discrimination, including the effects of slavery.If the Supreme Court ends affirmative action and colleges curtail the consideration of race as a factor in admission, campuses could become far less racially diverse.How did we get here?In the landmark 1978 caseRegents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court ruled that racial quotas in admissions were unconstitutional. That decision came after Allan Bakke, a white student, was twice rejected from UC Davis’ medical program, leading him to challenge the constitutionality of its affirmative action program.In his majority decision supporting UC Davis, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, a Virginian nominated by President Richard Nixon, held out Harvard’s admissions program was an example of how race can properly be taken into account in college admissions.""Race is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity, but it is only one factor weighed competitively against a number of other factors deemed relevant,” Powell wrote. “Under such a system, each applicant is treated as an individual regardless of race and is considered in competition for each seat in the class.""The latest debateNine years ago, a group calledStudents for Fair Admissions sued Harvard University. Led by Edward Blum, a conservative legal strategist and longtime critic of race-based admissions, the group claimed Harvard held Asian-American applicants to higher academic and personal standards in the admissions process.Harvard denied those charges, arguing that race is just one factor in its admissions criteria. Harvard also noted that its population of Asian-American students doubled from 15 to 30 percent in the last 20 years. No Asian American applicants took the stand to testify that they were denied admission to Harvard because of their race. The plaintiffs relied on statistical analysis and administrative notes in the margins that they claimed exhibited implicit bias.The decision, followed by an appealIn 2019, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants.Students For Fair Admissions disagreed. The group appealed the judge’s ruling and filed another lawsuit against the University of North Carolina. Those complaints have reached the Supreme Court.Last October, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and members of the majority conservative court asked questions from the bench that were deeply skeptical of the educational value of racial diversity.Many experts now predict the court will strike down race-conscious admissions.Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Holy CrossThomas is expected to issue the majority opinion on the case, which ironically benefitted students like him in the 1960s. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester through a program designed to make the campus more racially diverse.In his 2008 memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" Thomas said he felt stigmatized by affirmative action because his classmates at Holy Cross and later at Yale Law School viewed him as a beneficiary of the program and not as an accomplished student.The effects of a banNine statesalready have bans against race-conscious college admissions: Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington. States that have banned affirmative action have seena growing gapbetween the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American high school graduates compared to the percentage of those students enrolled in large public universities.After California voters enacted a statewide ban in 1996, Black enrollment at the University of California's most selective schoolsdropped dramatically.At U.C.L.A., the percentage of Black students fell by more than half, from 7% to about 4% within two years.What's next?Colleges have said they will continue their efforts to admit a racially diverse student body and even boost their recruitment efforts.Some civil rights activists have said that’s not enough, and have proposed adoptingslave descent as a factor in admissions.Such an approach is akin to “legacy admissions,” under which the children of alumni get prioritized in admissions, advocates have said.“Affirmative action, when it started, was aimed at addressing and remedying the history of discrimination against Black Americans and trying to open up opportunities for them,” said Ted Shaw, director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina. “It would be correct to return to the roots of these efforts.""Critics have questioned that approach, saying it would leave out other marginalized racial and ethnic groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who could be affected by a potential ban.SeparatorCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated which states have bans on affirmative action in college admissions."

It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: Aïda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. She’s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa.The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called“This is Where I Am.”“I have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,” Muluneh said. “I think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.”Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery.Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said.“I know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,” she said. “For those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.”She brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props.“I utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,” Muluneh said. “It's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.”This project is the first time in her career that she’s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square.“I liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,” Muluneh said. “To try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style.She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art.“It's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,” Muluneh said. “I enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.”"

She was considered a star among fellow superintendents and praised by community members, but Everett’s long-serving mayor was among those who voted her out.Tahiliani called the support she received at the meeting “overwhelming and heartening.”""As educators, everything we do is with the hopes of making some small impact. And last night, I felt reassured that I am doing my job. I will carry that encouragement and support with me through this difficult time,"" Tahiliani said in a statement.Tahiliani has served as Everett's superintendent since March 2020. As a woman of Indian origin, she was the first person of color to hold the post in a district where more than 80% of students are non-white and 89% of teachers are white.Just last year, she was awarded astatewide prizefrom the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. Her supporters, including M.A.S.S. Executive Director Tom Scott, said she'd brought needed stability to the school district after the previous superintendent wasconvictedof indecent assault of a school employee.Tahiliani had also received broadly positive feedback in school committee appraisals for the past two years. Mayor Carlo DeMaria was among those supporters in 2021 — but last year he was the lone committee member not to submit any appraisal.In January 2022, Tahiliani filed adiscrimination complaintagainst DeMaria, accusing him and others on the school committee of racism, sexism and interference with her work. And she alleged he was trying to “oust” her.The disconnect between the superintendent's positive feedback and committee members' critical views angered some members of the public at Monday's meeting, who blamed “old school politics” and racism for the decision.“Basically, as I see it, you have two choices. You have racism or anti-racism. Go back to the past or embrace the present and the future. You can use students, families and educators as pawns in your own internal squabbles. Or you can empower them,“ said teacher Shane McNally, addressing the committee before the vote.Several residents at the public microphone pointed to the influence of the mayor, now serving his sixth term in Everett.Resident Janice Lark called it ""a no brainer"" to renew Tahiliani and called for her opponents on the council to explain their positions.“The guy in the corner office does not want her here. We all know that,” Lark said. “Is it because her skin is brown? Is it because she's female? Is it because she's smart? What is it?”DeMaria did not explain his vote, but had made public his opposition to the superintendent in previous meetings. Others who voted no, like committee member Cynthia Sarnie, spoke of being harassed by members of the public and denied rumors that their votes had been bought. She also offered some specifics.“My vote would be based on the safety of the school and the cleaning and cleanliness of the schools,” said Sarnie.Marconi Almeida Barros, the lone member of color on the school committee, said Tahiliani had earned the committee’s support and reminded his colleagues they were the “voice” for students and families.“I don’t know how after listening to all of this, especially from students and parents, we would say no to the superintendent,” Almeida Barros said.Several students of color, like Everett high school junior Tiana Allen, came to the public microphone to explain why having Tahiliani in the role mattered.“When students see someone that looks exactly like them, holding amazing leadership skills and positions, it drives the students to do more,” said Allen, ”to reach for positions that felt so unbelievably out of reach... It means to drive Everett do more.”Tahiliani's current contract runs to March 2024.Qualified superintendents are in short supply nationally. According to M.A.S.S., the state currently needs to fill 45 of the 275 superintendent positions.Speaking to the school committee, Benjamin Murray, a teacher and member of his union’s negotiating committee made a dire prediction.""On the line is the future of the city, that is what’s on the line,” said Murray. “If you let her go tonight, you will not see another qualified candidate come across your table again.""SeparatorThis story was updated to include comment from Tahiliani."

Jim Wessler, the CEO for the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, said that almost 30% increased need for aides by 2030 comes on top of a current staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when a number of long-term care workers left the profession.“Some of them just decided, ‘I'm not going to do this anymore,’ because it was just too overwhelming, and they have their own families they have to take care of,” Wessler said. “So we have critical shortages today in nursing homes and assisted living. And we see that with hospitals having patients backed up that they can't place in long-term care facilities because long-term care facilities don't have beds, because they don't have enough staffing.”The report also projects that by 2050, Massachusetts will need 1,042 geriatricians — primary care doctors with additional specialized training to treat older patients — to serve 30% of its residents who will be 65 and older, regardless of whether they have dementia or not. At last count in 2021, there were only 214 geriatricians in the state.Wessler added that, right now, Massachusetts is facing “a really dramatic shortage of specialists like neurologists and geriatricians in particular.”Anastasia Canell, a doctoral candidate in counseling psychology with a focus in geriatrics at Lehigh University who is doing her residency in Massachusetts, recognizes the need for more specialists from her own experiences. Her grandmother had risk factors for vascular dementia but was not diagnosed until after the family noticed behavioral changes and contacted a neurologist. Now she wants to normalize the process for other families.“I honestly think about that every time before I go into a room with the family,” said Canell, who also does legislative advocacy work with the Alzheimer’s Association in the state. “I think about what would my family have needed in this moment? What would my family have benefited from? What kind of person would make this experience more comfortable?”Wessler said addressing the doctor shortage is particularly urgent with the recent accelerated approval by the FDA in January oflecanemab, only the second drug the agency has approved to treat Alzheimer’s. If the medication is approved for Medicare coverage, doctors anticipate a rush in demand. Wessler said the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association has a medical scientific advisory committee of specialists, including geriatricians, neurologists, neuropsychologists, from most of the major teaching hospitals in the state who have been meeting to prepare.“How are they going to handle what they anticipate will be an influx of demand for people to know if they're eligible for the treatment?” Wessler said. “And then another part of that is, how are we making sure that there is equity involved with this so that underserved communities are also getting access to the latest in treatment?”Wessler said equity is deeply embedded in diagnosis, treatment and outcomes with regard to Alzheimer’s. He said national statistics show that African American people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's and dementia as white people, and that Latino people are about one and a half times more likely to be diagnosed. He added that some of that increased risk is correlated to the disproportionate impact of heart disease in those communities.In Massachusetts, Wessler said his organization is working with several Community Health Centers to increase access to specialists, care aides and treatment for people of color and those with lower incomes.Equity is also an issue when it comes to meeting the projected needed increase of tens of thousands of care aides in Massachusetts.Marlishia Aho is the regional communications manager of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, a union representing over 80,000 health care and home care workers in the state. She echoed Wessler’s perspective on the effects of the pandemic on the shortage of care workers“It has only exacerbated the shortage,” Aho said. “Prior to the pandemic, we have seen that certified nursing aides were leaving the field because they were — as majority women, and women of color and immigrants who weren't paid fairly — seen as essential, but their wages and benefits didn’t mirror that.”Aho said, as of April 1, 58,000 personal care attendants they represent who are paid through MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, will be making $18 an hour, which works out to less than $38,000 a year. And she said, with the healthcare industry “just churning through workers,” she’s skeptical that finding another 30,000 care aides to enter the field by 2030 is a reachable goal.“Is it feasible? Not where we are currently,” Aho said. “Not with the wages we are providing to caregivers, but if we continue to invest in caregivers and listen to them, ensure they have a seat at the table, I think it is doable. But we have to value these roles because they are essential.”Aho added that recruiting and retaining care aides for those with dementia has a multiplying effect.“They allow other work to happen. So if I have someone caring for my elderly father, I am able to go out into the world and work. And so we have to think about it makes other work possible.”"

This Saturday, the inaugural event will step off from the old court house.“We’ll walk down Green Street to the end,” he said, turning to look north, “cross over to the waterfront there and walk along the boardwalk, just a short way into Waterfront Park.”Just over a year ago, it’s an event that would’ve been a distant dream in the city of less than 20,000.Last May, plans for a queer youth dance were thrown into chaos when the venue, a local Masonic lodge, abruptly pulled out less than two weeks before the event. The social organization’s statewide leadership had gone over members’ heads and called off the dance, seemingly over concerns about hosting an event for LGBTQ+ youth with a drag queen.But just as quickly, Newburyport’s community responded witha rush of support.Five venues offered up their spaces. Locals put together a welcoming wall of neighbors, where more than a hundred people showed up to wave flags, celebrate and stand in solidarity with the high schoolers. And the Masonic lodge went against orders: they hosted the dance anyway.It was a turning point for the city.Beyond Newburyport, organizers in small towns and cities across Massachusetts are making a concerted push for their queer neighbors feel seen and supported in their own communities, without having to go to the nearest big city. And it’s an effort that’s taken on additional meaning amid a national rise inanti-LGBTQ legislation in state legislatures.“After the ‘Over the Rainbow’ dance last May, we kind of reflected on everything that had happened — and the biggest takeaway was just this overwhelming outpouring of support from the community for our young people,” said Tarah MacGregor, who is now one of the Newburyport Pride board chairs.“We were like, ‘OK, Newburyport needs a Pride, right?’” she said.The nine-person committee in Newburyport, which had its first official meeting in December, is now putting the finishing touches on a dozen events, including a flag-raising with Gov. Maura Healey.“Every time somebody attacks our kids, it backfires ... because the community comes back with more love and more support than we could ever have imagined,” said James Giessler, who leads NAGLY, the North Shore Alliance of GLBT Youth. It co-sponsored last year’s dance. “As we see in Newburyport, with all the ruckus that they had, now they’re going to have one of the most spectacular Pride observations on the North Shore.”New Prides focus on celebrationThe Pride celebrations popping up in smaller cities and towns often take cues from the original marches, which were political protests in major cities that go back 50 years to commemorate the Stonewall riots. But today, these smaller Prides focus more on celebration, promoting visibility and making residents feel safe. Newburyport is far from Massachusetts’ first Pride outside of Boston; it’s not even the first Pride on the North Shore.Hope Watt-Bucci wanted to fight back against hate in her own community after she witnessed an older gay couple being mocked in a local restaurant and heard stories of homophobic taunts and assaults circulated on the North Shore. So, in 2012, she founded North Shore Pride and its first parade marched through Salem that June.Watt-Bucci remembered thinking she’d be glad if a hundred people came to the group’s first event. “Thousands of people showed up,” she recalled. “And I thought that, ‘OK, yeah, we need to do this. We clearly need to do this.’”Last year’s parade in Salem attracted 20,000 celebrants.Enough Pride celebrations have cropped up over the last decade that Watt-Bucci started what she calls the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together organizers from different North Shore celebrations.She and a dozen other organizers gathered on a recent Tuesday evening at a Beverly restaurant. It was a logistics-dominated evening, talking through event insurance, food trucks and 501c3 paperwork. But the room often burst into applause as organizers reveled in the dozens of events that would be held in cities and towns across the North Shore in June: drag queen bingo in Wenham, youth Pride in Lynn and a flurry of flag-raisings.This year, Topsfield is hosting Tri-town Pride for the second year with Boxford and Middleton — though it’s the first year they’ll have a parade — in response to a protest at a Boxford drag queen story hour last year. A formalized nonprofit is organizing Pride in Lynn for the first time. Revere will host its second annual “Beach Pride.” Wenham and Hamilton will have their third joint Pride picnic. Swampscott had its first Pride in 2020, and this year there’s a new addition: a “Run with Pride” 5k.'Everybody's welcome' doesn't apply just to big citiesParades and other celebrations are often just “the tip of the iceberg” of deeper changes in the towns that are hosting them, according to Kim Creasap, who researches small-town Pride events in the Midwest. She’s found Ohio towns where organizers are celebrating the passage of a local ordinance, scaling up the reach of local support groups or hoping that a big celebration could be an economic boon.“There was actually a lot of advocacy behind the scenes leading up to Pride,” Creasap said, referencing those Midwestern cities and towns. “So, in other words, the Pride parades — or picnics, or festivals — were kind of a more visible consequence of a less visible community organizing that has been going on.”Joan Ilacqua leads The History Project, which preserves archives of New England’s LGBTQ+ history. She thinks part of the reason that more towns are hosting Prides is to fill the “vacuum” left by Boston Pride, which last hosted a parade in 2019, and that the increase in small-town and small-city Prides is the sign of a real shift.“People are feeling more comfortable being visible where they are, being in community with their neighbors,” Ilacqua said. “It kind of proves that you don't have to go away to the big city to be part of the queer community.”In Wenham, the third annual Pride flag raising is being organized by the city’s human rights committee. Martha Brennan, the chair, thought back to when the committee was first formed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, with the goal of making residents of all backgrounds feel more welcome in town.“One of the really endearing things that happened after our first flag raising was that a lesbian couple said it was the first time that they felt comfortable walking down the street holding hands because there’s not a lot of visibility,” Brennan recalled, referring to her town with 5,000 residents. “It’s a very small town and people are unsure of what others are thinking. And so it’s a nice way to signal that everybody’s welcome.”New beginnings come full circleFor Newburyport, this new chapter started with a difficult launching-off point, but one that many community members are glad to turn into a positive change for their city.The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in a written reply to GBH News, said it decided that it was not the right organization to hold the event, and that it would have been better suited for a school or public building. Last year, members of the Masonic lodge, which had initially canceled the queer youth dance on the organizers, ended up rebelling against the statewide organization.“The feeling was overwhelming, knowing that we were providing a safe space for them,” Michael Switzer, the former leader of the St. John’s Lodge, said when he thought back on that night last spring. “Knowing that even an ounce of that discrimination and pain that they felt came from our organization, we knew that we had to do the right thing.”It came with consequences. Many of the local Masons were reprimanded, suspended or expelled from the organization for their decision. But Switzer and others decided to form a new social club called the Wolfe Club that, this year, is sponsoring Newburyport Pride and is planning its own event to raise more funds for the Pride committee.“It’s really been fulfilling for us to come full circle,” Switzer said. “When you’re an ally and you make a sacrifice, it doesn’t have to be a sad, negative story. ... And it’s really been amazing to see what we’ve been able to accomplish in a year.”Seventeen-year-old Sully McLellan was one of the high schoolers at last year’s dance — one of at least 100 kids.“There was more food than we needed. We had, like, pints of ice cream that was donated that were never broken into,” he said. “It was just a really good experience. And the drag queen was really good, too.”This year, the youth dance will be held at City Hall. McLellan is taking the lead on organizing with a blacklight, outer-space theme. Members of the new Wolfe Club will be stationed outside, donning shirts that read “safety and support.”Hundreds of T-shirts and stickers are on their way for people and businesses around town to advertise their LGBTQ+ pride, and groups are readying to march their way down Green Street to the city’s waterfront on Saturday.For parade co-chair MacGregor, who grew up in a New Hampshire town just across the border from Newburyport, it’s coming full circle, too.“Growing up as a young queer person, I didn’t feel like I had community. And being able to be part of this volunteer mission, to create community where there is so much support and where young people can grow up and see these events happening and feel valued by their community?” she said. “That’s the goal.”"

The incident has resulted in protests and multiple lengthy community meetings. In response, city officialshave pledgedto implement body cameras for police and look at alternative responses to 911 calls.“Following the tragic police shooting of Arif Sayed Faisal, I have been committed to charting a path forward by working with the Police Commissioner and City department heads to evaluate our existing services and implement the six recommendations outlined by the City Council that will strengthen our overall safety and support for the Cambridge community,” City Manager Yi-An Huang said in a press release announcing the move on Friday. “Bringing on PERF is one of several commitments we are in the process of implementing and they have a strong record on police reform and helping departments make meaningful changes.”The independent review will be conducted by a team at the Washington, D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum that will include both law enforcement officials and civilian members, including one who specializes in officer-involved shooting investigations, according to the press release. Part of the review will involve interviews with those involved in Cambridge’s emergency response, such as dispatchers and trainers.Barbara Dougan, legal director for the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was cautiously optimistic about the announcement.“It may turn out to be a good thing if they are willing to look at this beyond the confines of your traditional policing analysis. If they’re willing to be visionary and explore alternative ways of responding to an incident where someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis,” Dougan said. “If instead, they limit themselves to kind of the traditional analysis, they may not end up with anything that, at least from our perspective, is that much more helpful.”Dougan emphasized that the external review will have no effect onthe judicial inquest,an independent investigation that began last month to determine whether there’s probable cause that the officer who shot Faisal committed a crime. That investigation is being conducted at the request of the Middlesex district attorney's office and involves the DA's office, Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the DA's office and the Cambridge Police.“[PERF’s independent review] will help us continue to learn and grow from the January 4th fatal shooting, particularly from the lens of our policies and procedures,” Police Commissioner Christine Elow said in the release. “Additionally, we expect they will help us with recommendations on less-than-lethal alternatives, how we could evolve the department and city’s capacity for alternative responses to mental health crisis’; and identify new or enhanced prospective training opportunities that would support safe, effective crisis response services to residents with behavioral health challenges. Ensuring that our officers and staff receive training that is consistent with national best practices will enhance the safety of our residents and officers, and help promote trust within the community.”Cambridge has separately allocated $3 million for the creation of a newcommunity safety departmentoutside of the police department, formed at the recommendation of a task force in 2021 that would be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals to respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The department’s interim director says they're planning to have responders from the new department begin responding to 911 calls in the fall of this year."

Caleb has a diagnosis of an extremely rare, life-threatening condition called cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD. The disease took the life of Caleb’s cousin, Evan, when he was just 9 years old, pushing Caleb and his brother Tyler to both get tested. Both boys ended up having the genetic mutation that could lead to CALD.In December of last year, Caleb’s lesions began to appear. Teams of doctors and specialists led them to Boston from their home in Ohio, and he’ll be undergoing a new type of gene therapy at Mass General: Skysona, a treatment approved by the FDA last fall, that could save his life. Caleb’s parents, Shauna and Lonnie McMillan, joined GBH’sAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath to tellCaleb’s story, share each step of the journey and explain where they’ll go from here.Arun Rath:Shauna, take us back to when you decided to take your boys to be tested. Had you ever heard about this disease before what happened with Caleb’s cousin, Evan?Shauna McMillan:Well, kind of, but not really. When I was eight years old, I watched [the movie] “Lorenzo’s Oil,” and it was about a little boy with ALD. So back in the past, I had heard of it, but I never imagined it would have affected our family like this. It all just kind of flashed back.With this diagnosis, we just right away knew with it being an X-linked disorder, I could have inherited it and passed it on. So right after we had suspicions and genetic testing back for Evan, we had both of the boys immediately tested. After about two weeks, we had our results back, and we were able to confirm the diagnosis.Rath:As a parent, it’s hard for me to get my mind around what that would be like. You can’t be paralyzed, so what do you do from there?Lonnie McMillan:We were fortunate enough to be put in touch with some other people who had gone through this. We learned pretty quickly about what the whole journey would be like. There’s a lot of different ways that it can go.Every six months, they have to get MRIs to make sure that nothing shows up. For our other son, Tyler, it’s come back clean every time, but for Caleb, back in his December MRI, we found out, which was the most difficult thing.Rath:Tell us about the path that led you to Massachusetts, to what could be a potentially life-saving treatment here.Shauna:In 2018, our geneticist recommended: the only way to stop this from forming was a bone marrow transplant. But for a small group of boys, there aren’t any available donors. Our geneticist recommended that we do this testing in advance to kind of have an idea, if the boys develop a cerebral form of the disease. In 2018, we had them both tested. Tyler, again on the lucky side, had 230 matches. Caleb had none.So we followed up to see what our options were. We were, at the time, following some gene therapy clinical trials that were going on, so that became a reality once we knew that Caleb would not have a match. We knew that the only option for him would be this gene therapy.Thankfully, in September of 2022, it was approved by the FDA. Following his MRI in December, we knew right away that we were going to have to go this route. Having followed the study, we knew that it was only available in Boston and Philadelphia, so that was what began our path.After that, there were several phone calls between our doctors, communicating back and forth. Then, in March, they brought us out to do another MRI to make sure the disease was progressing; every now and then, it’ll show up, and then it’ll just halt. From there, we arrived in Boston last Tuesday, and we had doctor’s appointments. On Monday, he was admitted to Boston Children’s, where they put in a tube that harvests the white blood cells that they will send for the therapy to be created.Rath:That’s amazing. And he was discharged?Shauna:We had a very successful harvest. Typically, the kids are on the machine for about six hours. He was kind of borderline in terms of whether or not they would have the cells, so they proactively said, “Let’s go for two more hours.” So he was hooked up to the machine for eight hours.Rath:It’s incredible, using his own cells to heal.Shauna:It’s pretty amazing. In 8 to 10 weeks, those cells will be ready, and they’ll send them back.Rath:Had it not been for the tragedy with his cousin, you wouldn’t have had any reason to think to test your boys. Should screening for this be more widespread?Shauna:Oh, absolutely. There is a community right now trying to get newborn screenings in every state. The earliest detection is essential for keeping this managed, for the best outcome for the kids.Lonnie:If it weren’t for us knowing, it would have been the same result for Caleb. If we found it too late, there would have been nothing that could have been done. Kids have a chance if they know what they’re up against before it takes their life away.Shauna:It’s a very risky procedure. Obviously, a gene therapy transplant like this has a lot of components. It’s the only thing available right now to stop this disease, so just being aware is absolutely essential for the best outcomes.Lonnie:And for Caleb’s specific case, the fact that this gene therapy is available is truly amazing, especially the timing of it. A coupe of years ago, we may have been able to get it done through a clinical trial, but beyond that, it really would have been limited options.You probably would have had to go through with the bone marrow, and with him not having a good match, it really wouldn’t have been a good option if therapy hadn’t been developed. Fortunately, it came just in time."

Peter Benson said. “The big thing was really where the funding was going to come from.”Dennis police plan to start using body cameras this May, using a $100,900 grant from the state to implement and support a 40-camera program for three years.The grant is part of $2.5 million in state funding issued in November to help 32 police departments adopt or expand body-worn camera programs.In announcing the first round of these grants in 2021, state officials said only 10% of municipal police departments in the state already had body cameras, but75% of departments were interested in using the devices. Overall, the state plans to distribute $20 million over five years, which it has said would be enough to buy about 9,000 body-worn cameras and servers for video storage.Discussions about police transparency and accountability have led many departments to consider implementing bodycams. Last summer, a task force created under the state's 2020 police reform law issued specific body camera guidelines for towns and cities. Thetask force also concludedthat financing these programs would be a critical issue for local governments to address.Police departments that have benefited from state funding say the grants can help get them up and running, but some — especially those in smaller towns — are concerned about finding funds to support ongoing costs.It's all about the moneyMichael White, a professor at Arizona State University and co-author of ""Cops, Cameras, and Crisis: The Potential and the Perils of Police Body-Worn Cameras,"" said cost is one of the main issues departments face when implementing body-worn camera programs.He said that beyond startup funding, it’s important for departments to address long-term financial considerations like maintenance and storage. Police body cameras generate large video files that must be stored for years for investigative purposes.“The ongoing costs are what add up really quickly,” White said.Dalton, a suburb of Pittsfield, received $129,368 from the state's latest round of grants. It used the money to equip 14 police officers with body-worn cameras, launching the program in March.“I’ve always been interested in them,” said Deanna L. Strout, who has been Dalton’s police chief for two years. “When the state’s putting out grant funding for the body cams, I think it’s just a smart move to be proactive and get ahead of it.”Strout said her department's funding should cover the program for five years, but she worries about the long-term cost. She hopes future grant funding will ease some of the community burden.“It’s a mandated situation,” she said. “It’s not fair to the taxpayers of small towns to have to foot such a large bill.”SeparatorGBH News is committed to providing in-depth coverage of police body camera issues, and will be reporting on this subject throughout the year. If you have story ideas or suggestions, contact us atinvestigations@wgbh.org.SeparatorHanover Police Chief Timothy Kane, whose department received $110,702 to equip 30 officers for their program launching in July, said data storage costs are a pain point for many departments, especially with the grant’s requirement that departments save files on their own servers, rather than in the cloud. Kane said the department worked closely with Hanover’s information technology office to identify the most cost-effective option.“We know many cities/towns face a significant challenge when it comes to funding storage,” Kane said in a statement to GBH News. “We looked at this challenge as one we would overcome so long as we purchased the correct equipment.”Southborough received $78,547 from the state, and deployed 19 cameras in April as part of a trial program to get officers acquainted with equipment and sort out any technical issues. Southborough Police Chief Ryan Newell said that the department planned on full implementation for May 2.Newell said that grant will support the town's body camera program for five years. After that, the costs will be treated like any other police equipment needs and be factored into the town's capital budget — the same approach Benson will apply in Dennis.Shifting perspectivesWorcester, which was part of the first round of state grants,launched its body camera program in February. The city had been studying the issue for more than eight years. Funding was a major factor in the slow rollout. In addition, some police officials expressed concern that body cameras would change officers' behavior, such as not using force even when deemed appropriate, due to potential public criticism.Cambridge faced a different hurdle, with a local ordinance meaning police needed approval from City Council to acquire surveillance technology. After thepolice killing of Sayed Faisal, which led to greater calls in the community for police transparency, the cityannounced it would pursue a bodycam program. Officials have not yet provided a timeline or additional details.North Reading Police Chief Michael Murphy, who’s department received a $133,994 grant in the latest distribution, said in a statement to GBH News that he and three lieutenants have agreed to wear body cameras, however the Patrol/Sergeant’s Union has not.“I believe every police officer should be equipped with them,” Murphy said in a statement to GBH News. “Although the camera does not provide a complete view of what an officer sees, they should be utilized despite the shortcomings.”Murphy said so far, the state has released funding for him and the three lieutenants to buy cameras and storage, with the rest of the funding set to be released once an agreement is reached with the Patrol/Sergeant’s Union. North Reading Patrol/Sergeant Union President Tim King declined to comment but said the union anticipates the issue to be a subject of upcoming contract negotiations.Shekia Scott, who founded the Boston Police Camera Action Team in 2014, said over the years she has seen the issue shift from controversial to an expectation for police departments. She said as more departments adopt body-worn cameras, she hopes the programs can be used to examine policing at a deeper level.“Body cameras initially give us more insight into the psychology and sociology of policing,” she said.However, Scott said in adopting new technology, it is important to keep the community at the table for oversight.“We’re funding something where again the police are policing themselves,” she said.White, the Arizona State University professor, said most departments have taken the approach of using body-worn cameras to show they have “nothing to hide.”In the Dennis Police Department, Benson said he had seen officers' attitudes toward body cameras change as they recognized the benefits. He said in the past, many officers looked at body cameras with skepticism, but that has largely evaporated.“A lot of [police] thought ‘They’re just trying to catch us doing things that we shouldn’t be doing’ or looking for a gotcha moment,’” he said. “The attitude [now] is more ‘no, this is a protection for us.’”Strout said she has also seen many officers understand the value footage from body cameras can have for officers.“If there’s a question about what happened it’s there,” Strout said. “It’s not ‘he said versus she said.’ It’s documented evidence.”Southborough Chief Newell agreed.“All you have to do is press play,” he said."

In 2013, a statue of father and son was erected near the Boston Marathon’s starting line in Hopkinton.Dick Hoyt died in 2021.“It’s hard to believe they both have now passed on but their legacy will never die. Dick and Rick Hoyt have inspired millions around the world,” said Dave McGillivray, the race director of the Boston Marathon and other events that the Hoyts participated in. “We will always be grateful, Rick, for your courage, determination, tenacity and willingness to give of yourself so that others, too, could believe in themselves, set goals and make a difference in this world as you have.”"

The report also found, for the first time ever, that children of color are being diagnosed at a higher rate than white children.To help make sense of what the new data mean, autism researcher Dr. Sarabeth Broder-Fingert spoke with GBH'sAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath. Broder-Fingert is a professor of pediatrics and associate director of research at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath:Before we dive into the details of this new data, help us understand a bit more about what an autism diagnosis means for a child and their family.Sarabeth Broder-Fingert:Well, an autism diagnosis can actually mean a range of things because it's such a spectrum. In general, children will undergo relatively extensive testing to determine if they meet criteria for autism. Once obtaining a diagnosis, that's the gateway into getting a variety of treatment services that children need. Those can range from daily support for social communication, many children will also need additional support, things like occupational therapy and physical therapy. There are very high rates of other comorbid conditions, particularly mental health disorders, so it may also mean additional support for mental health concerns — along with the supports for core symptoms of autism.Rath:When you're looking at new data like this, how do you tell whether autism rates are rising versus, maybe, the testing is revealing more than it did in the past?Broder-Fingert:Yeah, this is a common point of conversation. I think that the rates are likely both rising, and we're doing a better job at detecting autism. I think it's probably both things together, although it is a little hard to pull apart because it's certainly possible that a lot of this relates to our ability to understand and detect autism more accurately and more fully than in years past, which allows us to find kids who are out there who had been missed previously. I think, and many people believe, that probably the larger contributor here is that we're doing a better job of actually finding these kids and being able to get them a diagnosis. With that said, it's undeniable that the rapid increase in prevalence is likely multifactorial.Rath:With what looks like a dramatic increase over just five years, do we have a sense of why autism rates are rising in that way?Broder-Fingert:Well, I think first, for sure, one reason is just that we're getting better at finding it. I think that the new data on race and ethnicity is a great example of that. Many of us in the field have been working for years, really focused on these dramatic disparities that exist in diagnosis.In the original CDC data that that came out almost 20 years ago now, there were profound differences by race and ethnicity in the prevalence numbers. We've been working hard to close that gap. Most people believe that that gap is only related, really, to society's ability to help diagnose and support those families and those kids have just been getting missed. In some ways, the new data is showing that both the prevalence and those numbers by race ethnicity have have dramatically changed are really a reflection of a lot of, I think, successes that we've had in the community trying to improve diagnostic services and address health disparities.With that said, I do think that although there's things to celebrate about the fact that we're doing a better job diagnosing children of color particularly, I think this is the the first step in a long list of things that need to be accomplished. I think we have achieved some better equity in diagnosis but these data don't reflect how many of these kids are actually getting into treatment.I do worry greatly that although we've decreased the disparities in actual diagnostic numbers, we haven't decreased the disparities in which of these kids are actually getting evidence-based treatment and all the support that they need. So, I think we still have a long way to go, but I do think that that these numbers should give us some hope that we are doing a better job at finding kids and getting them a diagnosis.Rath:That's fascinating. So, it used to be that the gap was that more white children were diagnosed with autism? And it's been a correction?Broder-Fingert:That's exactly right. There used to be really large differences by race and ethnicity. The challenge has been that, as a society, we were just not diagnosing Black children or children of color at the rate that we were diagnosing white children — for reasons such as bias within the health care system, structural racism and the tools that we use not being sensitive to different racial and ethnic backgrounds. I think there's been a huge effort across the country to try to close some of those gaps and I think that's that's what's happened here.Rath:That's fascinating, because it also seems like it would enforce a stereotype of autism somehow being a disease of affluence.Broder-Fingert:Exactly, and I do think that was a stereotype for a long time and has been a huge problem. There have been a number of us who have been working really hard to change that perception. I do think that we're having some impact, although we have a long way to go. For many years, it was believed that autism was a condition that was only in affluent or white populations.Rath:So, if there's been this lag with children of color not getting diagnosed and there's been this catching up on that, it would seem like there would also have to be a lag in treatment, right? And getting these children of color treatment at the same rate?Broder-Fingert:I think anyone who works in the community and anyone who looks at the data would know that, although we're now catching up on diagnostics, we still have a ways to go on treatment. Children of color still have a harder time getting all the different evidence-based treatments. As I mentioned before, autistic children will often need multiple treatments from different providers, from different service settings — whether it's the school and the health system or community resources.We know that, although we've made this gain in diagnosing children of color, we have not yet caught up in getting them into treatment. I think for those who are focused on equity and disparities, that is going to be a next really important step to focus on: really getting these kids into treatment and and supporting their families so that, once they're diagnosed, they have all the services they need. We're certainly not close there. But with that said, 15 years ago, I would have been very surprised that we have now made such an impact on diagnostic disparities. So I would say there's hope that, with the focus on treatment, that we can achieve a similar outcome that has been achieved here.Rath:Dr. Broder-Fingert, it is really eye-opening and helpful to be able to break down this data from the headlines in this way. You've done a brilliant job of it. Thank you so much.Broder-Fingert:Oh, my pleasure."

Hoo boy.Both new and used prices have stopped skyrocketing. In fact, both dipped slightly in February.But the average new-vehicle transaction price is still $48,763, according to Kelley Blue Book. Before the pandemic, the average new vehicle sold for $37,876.At an auto show this year, Noah and India Grabisch of Laurel, Md., were looking at new SUVs, which they liked. But an $86,000 price tag for a Chevrolet Suburban?Well ...""It looks nice,"" India Grabisch said. ""But ... no.""The used-car market doesn't provide much relief either. Retail used-vehicle prices now average $26,510.And after falling last year, closely watched wholesale prices, a key indicator of where markets are headed, are actually rising again.Why are prices remaining stubbornly high? Here are a few reasons.Supply chain woes are still reverberatingThe semiconductor shortage has gotten much better since 2021, but it hasn't gone away entirely, and other supply chain snarls continue to periodically disrupt output.Because of these supply chain problems, the global automotive industry has produced millions fewer vehicles than it would have otherwise.The supply of new vehicles is starting to improve, but those millions of ""missing"" vehicles are still gone. Lower supply, higher prices: It's basic economics.Which cars are being made? Not the cheap onesWhen automakers can't make as many vehicles as they would like, they prioritize their most profitable cars. Cheap ones get the boot.Consider what happened at Nissan, which continued to struggle with supply chain challenges throughout 2022. In response, it cut production of one of its cheapest cars, the Nissan Versa, by 78%. Nissan also reduced sales of two other cheap models, the Sentra and the Kicks.Bigger, slightly more expensive vehicles, like the Altima and the Pathfinder? Nissan boosted production of those.It wasn't because of a lack of buyers on the cheap end, says Judy Wheeler, Nissan U.S.'s vice president for sales and regional operations.""In the last month, we have seen search increase for the Nissan Versa, Sentra and Kicks, indicating a growing interest in this segment among consumers,"" she told NPR via email.She said Nissan intends to build more of those entry-level vehicles when the supply chain permits.It's not just Nissan. Across the board, automakers have been focusing on bigger, more luxurious, more expensive vehicles. And the ones they make also tend to be packed with extra features that bump up prices even more.Fewer cars — and higher prices — are very profitableThe shift in the market has been remarkable, and automakers are in no hurry to reverse course.Consider just how big the change has been. Cox Automotive crunched the numbers and found that from December 2017 to December 2022, sales of new cars under $25,000 — affordable, by new-car standards — dropped 78% and went from almost 13% of total new-vehicle sales to just under 4%.Sales of new cars over $60,000, meanwhile, skyrocketed. Those vehicles, costing more than the annual income of the average American, went from 8% of the auto market to 25% of sales.Because those $60,000 vehicles are significantly more profitable than the $25,000 ones, this shift is very, very lucrative for car companies. And they're especially focused on fat margins, instead of big volumes, because they're investing heavily in new electric vehicles (EVs).""The pricing environment that we're in right now has been very good, very robust,"" General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors on an earnings call last year. ""And ... running the business for cash flow is critical to help fund our journey in the EV transformation.""Yesterday's new cars are today's used cars ...Three years ago, when production lines started to slow, it affected both the new- and used-car markets immediately. Fewer new cars sent new prices up. That, in turn, pushed many shoppers into the used-car market. And more shoppers in the used market pushed prices up there, too.But the new-car woes also had a delayed effect on the used-car market — because new cars, obviously, become used cars after some time.So all those top-of-the line cars that were made in 2021 are now some very nice two-year-old cars, which means even in the used market, the high end of the market is booming.Meanwhile, because automakers cut production of cheap, no-frill sedans, people looking for cheaper late-model used cars are now out of luck.""We are firmly in the teeth of an extremely tight used-vehicle market, and that is directly a function of what has happened over the past three years,"" says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.Lonnie Smith, president of the nonprofit On the Road Lending, works to help working families get affordable loans for decent used cars, preferably those still under warranty.""Typically we're looking for vehicles that are two to four years old, less than 60,000 miles — a modest type of vehicle,"" he says.Those have gotten so hard to find lately that On the Road got licensed to be an auto dealer so it could buy vehicles at auction — the few cars that fit the bill on dealer lots were getting snapped up immediately.And the average loan for those cars, which was $13,000 ten years ago, has now risen to $24,000.Because, well, that's just the price of a modest used car in America these days.But there is some hope: EV prices could come downAs the chip shortage eases, automakers say they want to make more vehicles for people who can't afford top-of-the-line full-size SUVs. But don't expect a tsunami of $15,000 cars.""We're not really expecting to see, you know, this resurgence of inexpensive gasoline-powered vehicles,"" says Ed Kim, chief analyst at AutoPacific. ""Really where the industry is going is putting in a lot of effort to get more affordable plug-in vehicles out in the marketplace.""In fact, led by Tesla's aggressive price cuts, electric vehicle prices are dropping. According to the latest Kelley Blue Book data, they're down 7.5% year over year, and that's before federal tax credits (including for used vehicles).But there are daunting challenges — especially around charging infrastructure — before many car buyers will purchase an EV. And prices have a long way to fall before they're truly affordable. Investors were recently disappointed when Tesla, which has long promised a cheaper vehicle, did not unveil one.So cheaper vehicles are on the way. But many of them will be powered by batteries, and they'll take a long time to get here. [Copyright 2023 NPR]"

Correcting that deficiency is the central piece of the MBTA’s new safety plan, submitted Monday to the FTA. The federal agency still must approve the plan.The revised plan prioritizes improving communication procedures so that train dispatchers and train operators know exactly where and when crews will be working on repairs to the transit system’s tracks.A pilot program being tested on the Blue Line employs electronic maps to allow dispatchers to track the presence of workers on rights of way in real time. If it proves to be a success, it will be implemented throughout the systemAnother pilot is being tested on the Green Line, where most of the near misses occurred, employs flaggers who alert train operators to the presence of workers on tracks ahead.The plan also addresses problems with radio communications. It seeks to “ensure unambiguous and explicit communication” between flaggers and dispatchers by reviewing and revising the information that should be exchanged during those interactions. And potentially thousands of radios will have to reconfigured with specific channels established to improve communications between workers and supervisors.The proposal submitted Monday was the MBTA's second version of this safety plan. The FTA judged the initial submission in May to be insufficient, as it would take months to enact new protocols and procedures. The FTA cited an imminent danger to workers and required a new plan that would have the MBTA implement corrective actions within 60 days.In a cover letter to the FTA, General Manager Philip Eng said many of the actions in the new plan are already underway, but some will require longer than a 60-day window. After meeting with FTA representatives last week, Eng said both sides agreed that too many changes made too quickly could increase the risk to workers and be counterproductive.Eng has said the FTA’s order to direct the T to resubmit a safety plan was “no big deal’ and normally how the agency interacts with the transit systems it oversees. Eng sees the relationship with the FTA as more cooperative than adversarial, and he welcomes the FTA’s involvement. He says the ultimate goal is enhancing safety which is good not only for T workers, but also the traveling public."

Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners.After crossing the starting line on East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle, then takes Beacon Street into Brookline and through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square.Find recommended spectator spots along GBH News'Boston Marathon route mapbelow.

That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don’t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September.The other way to run the marathon is as part of thecharity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who’s running the 2023 marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the “fastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.”The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men’s side are:Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who’s taking on Boston for the first timeafter winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon and setting the marathon world record; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men’s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women’s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia’s Atsede Baysa.The women’s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland’s Manuela Schär, who has won Boston four times; Australia’s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times.The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year.How much money do athletes win in the Boston Marathon?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments.

The FBI said it is not aware of any specific or credible threats to the race, but officials still recommend attendees remain aware.""Check your cellphone settings and make sure that your phone can receive emergency and public safety alerts to ensure that you receive any urgent public safety messages,"" MEMA acting director Dawn Brantley said during an April 13 press conference. ""This is a good idea every day and not just on marathon Monday.""How old is the Boston Marathon?The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest continually run marathon, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year.This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots’ Day — the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots’ Day.This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects forOne Boston Day.What other events will be happening the weekend of the 2023 race?The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay.April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels.

He called the situation a “full-scale humanitarian crisis.”Whether or not staff from the nonprofit La Colaborativa was aware of their arrival is up for debate. Gladys Vega, head of the social-services nonprofit, originally told members of themediathat she wasn’t given a heads-up about their arrival.But state officials told GBH News that the state Office of Refugees and Immigrants “had multiple conversations with La Colaborativa about their capacity and willingness to support these families.”“We have been working closely with La Colaborativa since last week on an orderly process to transition families to hotels,” state officials told GBH News on Monday in a statement released by Gov. Maura Healey's office.Healey’s office says the state is contracting with La Colaborativa to provide hotel rooms for homeless families under the Emergency Assistance program, with costs covered by the state. Nearly 70 municipalities across the state are hosting families needing emergency assistance, state officials said.The governor’s office said it continues to work with local and federal partners and community organizations to expand capacity of the emergency assistance system and find long-term solutions. In a high-cost state like Massachusetts, housing can be hard to find — even in the short term.La Colaborativa is currently helping temporarily house new arrivals in hotels in Everett, Saugus, Quincy and other areas. The state’s emergency shelter system is strained by the regional housing affordability crisis, and the lack of capacity is warranting the opening of new facilities, likeJoint Base Cape Cod.“Due to a critical shortage of available shelter beds and an increase in demand, we have had to use hotels and motels as a temporary, last resort to ensure families have safe housing,” the statement from Healey’s office continued. “The Family Welcome Center in Allston remains open as a central intake center, and we are connecting families with shelter as quickly as possible – whether that’s at Joint Base Cape Cod, hotels or other sites based on availability.”Officials from La Colaborativa declined to comment, saying that “due to rapid ongoing development of the situation and the sensitive nature of the cases, the state had asked the organization to refrain from interviews.”The nonprofitshared Instagram postslast week saying that, in just three days, its triage department “provided wraparound services for 250 individuals,” most of whom are Haitian. “Those services include food, housing, health assessments, and rapid reemployment.” Photos posted show families eating and children coloring at the organization’s offices in Chelsea.The Rev. Myrlande Desrosier, who heads the Everett Haitian Community Center, said she sent members of her team to Chelsea on Wednesday night when she heard La Colaborativa needed help.“Three things, people ask for. The first thing is spiritual support for the trauma. Secondly, people ask for some Haitian food. And the third is the housing,” she said. “In the beginning it’s like, ‘Let’s just get them some food.’ Many had not eaten in quite some time.”During the first two days, she said at least one woman needed medical care.“There was some cases, at least one of emergency pregnancy issues,” said Desrosiers.Train said many migrants have arrived in Massachusetts after beingbusedby Republican governors to New York City and eventually traveling north to Boston.“The city, La Colaborativa and our community-based partners barely sufficient resources to provide ample services for our existing residents, so this is truly outstripping our resource levels at this point, warranting state and federal resources,” he said.Train said the city was surprised by the arrivals, but the state has no way of predicting the numbers for planning purposes.“We see the state partners here doing the best they can with the systems that they have,'' he said. ""Unfortunately, those systems are not at adequate capacity don't have enough resources and need to be rapidly scaled. And what occurred Wednesday night was a major byproduct of that.”"

""I'm 25 and I have a curfew,"" she says. ""This is so gross. I hate it.""NPR is not using Faith's last name for this story. She says her ex-boyfriend emotionally and verbally abused her, and she doesn't want him to know where she is. On this day, she reclines on a couch in the living room of the recently renovated house where she now lives. It's a maternity home. Faith is 20 weeks pregnant.Called the Nesting Place, it's part of a Christian organization in Nampa, Idaho, that tries to dissuade people from abortion and persuade them to take up parenthood. Women can live in the home for free while they carry pregnancies. After their babies are born, they can stay for six months longer.Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the pugilistic state and federal legal battles that have followed have garnered all the attention. But another quieter story has played out for women in life-changing ways as the number of abortions has declined markedly.One group of researchers forecasts 60,000 fewer abortions in the year since abortion became largely illegal in much of the United States. These declines are in the states where pregnant women already faced the greatest risks of maternal mortality and poverty.For the women navigating these dangers, allies are hard to come by. Maternity homes are a rare source of support. They're free — but not without conditions.Faith struggled to accept the rules: phones turned in at night, home by 11 p.m., visitors only in common spaces, clean drug tests, compliance with the program and contributions to the household. Permission to leave overnight — even for just one night — must be earned through good behavior.""Those words were scary to me,"" says Faith. She'd lived on her own for five years before coming here. But she couldn't deny that it was the best option given her circumstances: single, pregnant, little family support, unemployed and homeless.She believed turning down the offer of a place to live would be a mistake. ""I just knew immediately,"" she says. ""I was like, 'I'd be so stupid.'""Pregnancy comes with many costsFaith grew up in Idaho in a family of hunters and sportsmen. But she's a born singer. Her voice is her gift. ""I am very, like — soulful rock,"" she says. ""Gospel worship is, like, a part of me."" Raised Mormon, she left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a teenager and discovered rock 'n' roll and singers like Adele. ""I'm a powerhouse, like belter, type of singer.""She knew she had talent, and neither Idaho nor Colorado, where she moved after high school to live with her sister, was the place to foster it. At 21, Faith packed her car for Los Angeles. She worked there in hospitality at some of the city's most breathtaking high-end hotels. She was the woman behind the front desk. ""I was good at it,"" she says. ""I loved it.""But last year, she met a man, also an aspiring musician, and threw herself into the relationship. Not long after, she says, she was feeling depressed, unsure where her music career was heading.With him, her life unraveled. She lost her apartment. They were soon homeless, bouncing from her car to motels. ""We would book the studio for music time and also sleep there,"" she explains. Her boyfriend told her he was a chef, but she became suspicious. He didn't work much.Faith realized how toxic the relationship was at just about the time she learned she was pregnant. The thought of entanglement with this man forever terrified her. ""My first thought was abortion,"" she says.But something held her back. She'd had an abortion a few years earlier. She still grieved that pregnancy. She felt certain it would have been a girl. She couldn't stop thinking about the child she might have had.""I don't live life with regrets,"" Faith says. ""I take on my choices. This is the one thing that I can't not regret. It's really heavy on my heart a lot of the time.""She called her mom back in Idaho. She recalls her mother saying that ""you can do this"" and that ""we'll figure it out. I think that you'll be a wonderful mom.""""I didn't know that that's what I needed to hear until she told me that.""Faith got rid of half her possessions and flew home. She still remembers the relief she felt that day as she watched LA recede in the distance, out the airplane window.But shortly after she got to Idaho, things began to fall apart there, as well. Her stepfather kicked her out of the house. She had already let keeping the pregnancy take root in her mind. It would be a girl, she thought. The thought of not having a place to bring her baby home to terrified her.That's when she walked into Robin Watters' crisis pregnancy center.Maternity homes are a solution the Christian right can supportBack in 2018, Watters read an article in a Christian publication. It posed a question: ""What would your state do if Roe v. Wade was overturned?"" At the time, that seemed like an outlandish possibility. But it got her thinking. ""Wouldn't a maternity home,"" she says, ""be the perfect answer?""There are more than 400 maternity homes across the U.S., according to the Maternity Housing Coalition, an umbrella advisory group. Many are associated with crisis pregnancy centers and — like the Nesting Place — a Christian ministry.Watters was already running a crisis pregnancy center called Lifeline Pregnancy Care Center when she began dreaming about building a maternity home. She'd seen hundreds of pregnant young women who needed a place to live and, she thought, would benefit from a relationship with the church. She pitched the idea to her board of directors. They went for it, and contractors were finishing renovations on the home that the center had purchased when the Supreme Court issued the decision that overturned Roe. The Nesting Place opened in February.Nampa, a bedroom suburb of Boise, is not a rich community, but Watters says support for this project is broad and deep. To renovate and staff the house, the organization doubled its budget to a half-million dollars annually. It's now working to build an endowment to finance the operation indefinitely without depending on year-to-year donations.Nearby churches are a primary means of financial support. On a recent day, Keith Wagner, an evangelical pastor, stopped by. It was the first time he'd seen the house since its completion. He seemed awed. ""Robin,"" he said, ""This is amazing!""Sitting in the living room minutes later, Wagner said last summer's Supreme Court decision ending the national right to abortion took the Christian right by surprise.""Their position has way too often been only defined by what they're against — 'I'm against abortion.'"" But Wagner says after the court victory, things changed. ""They had to say, 'Oh, hold on a second. OK. We've prayed for this. Now what are we going to do?'""This year, thousands of low-income women and those living in poverty will have babies in Idaho. And more than 7,000 women a year in Idaho are reliant on Medicaid to cover births. The state now has some of the more austere abortion laws in the country. It's the only state where people can be prosecuted and go to prison for helping a minor leave the state to get an abortion.Wagner says he encourages people in his congregation of 4,000 to consider adoption or foster-parenting. But that level of sacrifice isn't something many are ready to make. Supporting an organization like the Nesting Place gives people a way to put money behind words.Even in best-case scenarios, this kind of organization cannot give women all the resources they need for 18 or more years of parenting. ""They chose life,"" Wagner said, ""but it's expensive."" That's why he supports the organization's stated commitment to helping women build financial skills and learn a trade.Even then, people will fall through cracks.Maternity homes don't work for everyoneThings have not worked out for at least one person who came to the Nesting Place. Autumn Hendry, who's 29, found the organization when she was nine weeks pregnant. She says her circumstances felt insurmountable: homeless and struggling with substance abuse. Abortion seemed her best option.But when Hendry met with the staff members at the crisis pregnancy center, they laid out another path: move into the Nesting Place, get clean, have the baby. ""They made me feel really comfortable,"" she said. ""I was able to quit using.""She stopped using methamphetamines and alcohol for a few weeks and earned an overnight pass for good behavior. While she was away from the maternity home visiting a friend, she relapsed.Watters and Nesting Place staff worked to find Hendry in-patient treatment. She enrolled but then left. Now, she's 26 weeks pregnant, unable to stop using and has no place to live.She regrets not having the abortion. ""I don't want to be pregnant anymore,"" she says. ""But it's too late now.""Placing her baby for adoption seems like an obvious path for Hendry. But she has already been down that road. She describes the day several years ago when authorities took her 5-year-old son, Jacob, from school. Child abuse, they said.""The loss was so bad,"" she says. Talking about it is wrenching for her. After Jacob's removal, Hendry says, she ""dove hard into drugs.""She fought to get Jacob back, but after a few years she could see his life was improving in foster care. She made the excruciating decision to sign over her rights. ""I decided it was probably best for him.""When she thinks about adoption and this pregnancy, she relives that trauma.She's couch-surfing now. On a recent day, she was sitting outside a friend's house not sure whether he'd open the door for her.The Maternity Housing Coalition acknowledges that substance abuse is a growing issue for maternity homes like the Nesting Place. But these homes are not typically based on a medical model of recovery or equipped to provide in-patient treatment.""I knew drugs would be in the mix,"" says Watters, the executive director. ""I just didn't know where or how much."" The twin issues of homelessness and substance abuse surprised her. She had imagined clients differently.""I thought it was just like, 'Oh, someone's pregnant, but they have, you know, their parents aren't wanting them to be,'"" says Watters. ""Or they have no friends, or they need a job."" She feels bad for Hendry, but she can't let her come back while she's using drugs. The rules are in place for everyone's safety. ""These are choices she's making,"" she says.Research shows that women with substance use disorders are at greater risk for unplanned pregnancies. And nearly 20% of people who seek abortions are homeless, according to one study.Still, Watters sees Hendry's case as a kind of victory. She persuaded this young woman not to have an abortion. ""The outcomes in this ministry are so hard to see,"" Watters says. ""It can be years later.""Faith forges a new pathFaith stands in the kitchen of the Nesting Place, sorting a pile of paperwork. ""This is what I'm working on now."" She gestures to a paper calendar. The days are filled with activities offered by Christian support groups — one for single moms and another that includes instruction on using Christianity to change behaviors. Recently, she says she has found her way to a new faith.She's hopeful that six months after she has the baby, she'll be eligible for free or reduced housing through a program that helps participants build financial skills. She plans to start massage therapy school in a few weeks.The staff members at the house breeze in and out. This place is staffed 24 hours a day. There are only two pregnant women living here now, but the staff hopes to expand to four soon.Another potential resident, 18-year-old Auna, comes by for an interview and to look around.She is 25 weeks pregnant. There is no turning back now. ""This is happening,"" she says, telling the staff that she'll think about moving in.Auna asks to be identified only by her first name because she hasn't told her school or employer yet. She doesn't want people to know about her situation or that she considered getting an abortion and even made calls about getting an appointment in the neighboring state of Oregon.Ultimately, she decided against it. ""My mom's always raised me to believe that abortion's not OK. I didn't realize how much it stuck with me until I got pregnant."" She's finding out the gender soon, she says with an excited smile. Auna is still in high school.Faith is also feeling excited, among other emotions. She's grappling with what it will mean to be a single mom; she's lonely at times, carrying a pregnancy without a partner.She's also mad. She's not planning to ask her ex-boyfriend for help, afraid of what he might do. It's unfair, she says, how little this situation demands of the father of her child. As far as she knows, he's still in Los Angeles. ""He gets to be there and continue his music journey and do what he's doing.""She's only 25, Faith reminds herself. She imagines someday — maybe four or five years from now — driving back to Los Angeles to resume her dream of singing professionally, this time with her daughter in tow.""I'm just pressing pause right now.""

Because the grass was greener on the other side.In Idaho, it's not unusual to see ranchers moving a bleating herd of sheep up to higher elevation at this time of year. But the sight of 2,500 wooly beasts trotting across a highway earlier this week brought a crowd about 300 people.It was the largest turnout that Steve Stuebner, spokesperson for the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission, has seen in 15 years.""It's a novelty. Maybe they've never seen anything like that before, but it's real typical in Idaho,"" he told KTVB-TV. ""When you're out in rural parts of Idaho in the spring and summer, or fall, you could run into a cattle drive or a sheep drive.""Curious onlookers lined the road as the animals sheepishly entered the highway, guided by ranchers and steered by sheepdogs. They traveled up the road a little ways, the fluffy white herd obscuring the yellow-painted centerline amid a chorus of ""baas"" and the lead ewe's jangling bell.Leaving the open road behind, they will journey through the sagebrush-dotted foothills for a few weeks to their summer home in the Boise National Forest.This trip up to higher elevations is a tradition dating back around 100 years, the Boise-area TV station reported, and having the sheep graze in the forest helps prevent fires and invigorates plant growth.The ovine spectacle will return when the sheep are brought back down again in the fall.

Maura Healey declared midday Monday that a common abortion drug “will remain safe, legal and accessible here in Massachusetts.” But a couple days later, the limits of that vow were already being tested.Wednesday night’s order from an appeals court will keep the drug, mifepristone, legal across the country, following a Texas judge’s decision last week that would have suspended its FDA approval. But the appeals court will allow years-old restrictions on when and how it can be distributed to women seeking abortions, a decision the Justice Department quickly appealed.In an order Friday,Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito postponed those restrictions from going into place until Wednesday night at the soonest.It’s created murky legal territory for providers and patients as they hope for clarity.The new order will shorten the timeframe mifepristone is approved for, from 10 weeks to 7 weeks of pregnancy; reverse the decision that allowed patients to receive the drug by mail; require multiple in-person visits; and limit which medical professionals are allowed to prescribe the drug. Providers and legal experts here in Massachusetts are closely watching how the Supreme Court will rule.Elizabeth Barnes said this week has been a “perfect storm nightmare” for women and providers.Barnes grew up on Martha’s Vineyard and is now president of The Women’s Centers, a group of independent abortion providers in Georgia, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The New Jersey clinic had just launched their mifepristone-by-mail telemedicine program this week and five patients were scheduled to get the abortion pills.They saw two of those patients earlier in the week, but mifepristone can no longer be sent through the mail after the new order goes into effect.The telemedicine director “had to break the news to these patients who were hysterically crying, could not figure out how they would change their planned schedule and call out of work so that they could now come in for services,” Barnes said.She said the provider was “heartbroken” that they had to turn the patients away so suddenly. They will have to find a clinic to get a surgical abortion — but Barnes notes that clinics in states where abortion is legal are already overburdened with people traveling across state lines to get abortions. Barnes said that Thursday one of the clinics treated a 14-year-old girl who had traveled more than 1,000 miles with her parents to access an abortion.Many hope that Massachusetts law will legally protect abortion providers and leave some discretion to individuals to use their medical judgment — for example, continuing to prescribe mifepristone after seven weeks. An executive order from Gov. Maura Healey Monday affirmed that a law signed last summer protects providers’ use of mifepristone, and UMass Amherst is stockpiling 15,000 doses of the drug at the governor’s request. But it’s not yet clear how far the law reaches to protect providers from legal liability.“Because of our Executive Order and large purchases of the medication, mifepristone will continue to be available in Massachusetts as it was before the ruling,” Healey said in a statement Thursday.Despite the reassurance from political leaders, providers and legal experts say the conflicting rulings and rapid changes are creating confusion.“You know, it could be different by the end of the day tomorrow,” said Sarah Burg, an attorney at Foley Hoag who advocates and works pro bono in the reproductive rights world.For providers, the confusion is disorienting.“People are scared and honestly very disturbed,” Julia Kehoe, president and CEO of Health Imperatives, which serves low-income populations at clinics in Hyannis, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket, Brockton, New Bedford, Plymouth and Wareham, said about their staff.Barnes said she’s frustrated that so much time has to be spent trying to figure out how conflicting legal opinions impact their day-to-day operations.“We’re spending hours and hours and hours on the phone and with our staff and our providers, again, trying to pivot around something that has absolutely nothing to do with the practice of medicine or the caring for people,” she said. “It’s the story of being an abortion provider. And I think in many ways it’s by design.”Attorney General Andrea Campbellsaid Fridaythat she “urged [the Supreme Court] to reject ... efforts to reinstate outdated and unwarranted restrictions on access to mifepristone.”The FDA is weighing two conflicting federal rulings. A second ruling out of Washington state, which came down minutes after the original Texas ruling last week, mandates that the FDA preserve existing access to mifepristone in 17 Democratic-led states after that group brought a lawsuit, a group that does not include Massachusetts.Dr. Danielle Roncari, vice president of medical services at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, called the restrictions “severe” and not based in medicine. She said providers will hopefully be able to rely on new protections in Massachusetts to keep offering mifepristone to patients, regardless of what happens.“Right now, mifepristone’s approval has not changed and Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts will continue providing medication abortion care as usual,” Roncari said.Kehoe has been consulting with legal experts about whether medical staff could count on protections in Massachusetts to offer medication abortion. They plan to start offering medication abortion at their clinics and via telehealth in July with newly awarded funding from the state.“We’re still looking into that. And we've been in touch with some national organizations who are looking into that exact issue right now. And there may be a possibility, but we just don't know yet,” Kehoe said.Recent figures suggest that the changes set to go into effect would change how tens or hundreds of thousands of women in the United States get abortions each year.More than 40% of medication abortions in the United States were at or beyond seven weeks of pregnancy, according to a2020 federal survey, something that would no longer be approved by the FDA.Lowering the limit to when a person can take mifepristone to seven weeks rather than 10 weeks is a significant change, Kehoe said, as many women don’t know they are pregnant at that point and are only just starting to consider their options.“We know that most people come [to the clinics] around or slightly after six weeks, six to nine weeks. Most people don't even know they're pregnant earlier than seven weeks,” she said. “And so this would require people to choose a surgical abortion, even if it's better for them to opt for the medication.”Prohibiting mifepristone to be sent through the mail would also be a significant barrier for patients, especially in rural areas, Kehoe said. A recent report found that one in 10 abortions nationally wereprovided by a virtual clinic, via telehealth, in December of last year.“I’m very concerned about the inability to mail the drugs, especially because we operate clinics in Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and then in large areas around Plymouth and the south coast where there's not a lot of access, whether it’s transportation barriers or other reasons, where people rely on getting through the mail,” she said. “So this would be a real problem and it would have a disparate impact on low-income people in communities without adequate transportation.”Update: This story was updated to include the order from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s action on the case."

Contract negotiations began three months ago, with the last contract expiring at the end of June.The 750 resident physicians — unionized with the Committee of Interns and Residents — are looking for higher wages and better benefits, arguing that it will create more livable conditions for current employees and help attract a more diverse workforce. Per the union, the first-year salary for resident physicians is under $67,000 — less than Cambridge Health Alliance, Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Mass General Brigham. Medical residents and fellows at Mass General Brigham justvoted to unionized this yearover their long hours and salaries, which start at $78,540.“Our ask is very simple. Boston Medical Center needs to pay us enough and provide the benefits we need to live and work in one of the most expensive cities in this country,” said Dr. Taha Khan, a resident physician in pediatric neurology. “Like so many BMC residents, I am constantly worried about being able to pay my rent. My bills are for parking at the hospital where I come to work and care for my patients.”Khan said, with a fair contract, the hospital could bring in more doctors of color who mirror the diversity of the hospital’s patients.Psychiatry resident Dr. Anisah Hashmi said the upfront cost of a medical degree can create workforce inequities, too.“That reinforces the model where only the wealthy have access to become doctors,” Hashmi said. “And when we reinforce that model, we do not have doctors that reflect the diverse patient population that we serve.”In an emailed statement to GBH News, Boston Medical Center said it, “greatly values the contribution our residents and fellows make to our hospital. We are actively in conversation with the Committee of Interns and Residents and look forward to, once again, negotiating a mutually agreeable contract.”Medical students, nurses, medical interpreters and teachers — as well as local officials such as City Councilors Ed Flynn, Liz Breadon and Ruthzee Louijeune — came out to support the physicians.“I'm really hopeful about this turnout that we had. It was phenomenal,” Hashmi said. “So I'm optimistic that when we go to the bargaining table tonight, we're going to get a different, better outcome, hopefully.”"

Then at age 15, he had an epiphany.“It was always going to be a part of my life,” he said. “I grew up in a household that allowed me to understand what it meant to be a professional musician.”Washington’s father, Rickey, was a saxophonist and flutist. And when Washington turned 13, he picked up his father’s old saxophone. But it took another two years, and an unexpected act by a music teacher, for him to realize his calling.Washington attended the Academy of Music of Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and was a member of the prestigious L.A. Multi School Jazz Band, a special program for exceptionally talented students. There, he played alongside young musicians who would go on to become heavyweights in the industry, likeTerrace Martin, trombonistIsaac Smithand the Bruner brothers — Grammy-winning drummerRonald Bruner Jr.and bassistStephen Lee ""Thundercat"" Bruner.“They were all so good,” he said. “I was good in my school, but in that band, I wasn’t one of the soloists.”During a performance at the Playboy Jazz Festival — a yearly gathering of established and up-and-coming jazz musicians, now renamed the Hollywood Bowl Jazz Festival — the band's teacher,Reggie Andrews, did something that startled the young Washington.“He just randomly gave me a solo,” Washington said. “While I was on stage, he pointed to me. And I literally looked around like, 'What? Me?'”The scene remains emblazoned in his mind. He recalls the solo as being a sub-par.“People said I sounded good, but I just wasn’t happy with how I sounded,” he said.But it was that moment — and the awareness that he could have done better — that set Washington on the path to becoming a living legend.“That was the moment when I was like, ‘I’m going to really take this seriously,’” he said. “That’s when I was like, 'You know what? I’m going to practice eight hours a day.' Because I knew what I was supposed to do to get good. My dad had told me. I had read it in the books. And I knew I wasn’t really doing that.”Nearly three decades later, Washington’s name is synonymous with contemporary jazz and improvisation. He is a frequent collaborator with Kendrick Lamar, providing the saxophone on the rapper's award-winning albums, “To Pimp A Butterfly” and “DAMN.” He has performed with legends like Herbie Hancock. And he composed the Grammy-nominated score for Michelle Obama’s Netflix documentary, “Becoming.”But even with a stack of accolades, Washington doesn’t feel pressured to continue raising the bar.“I don’t think of it as pressure,” he said. “I’ve always looked at it as opportunity.”It’s a nonchalant attitude that might have come from the unexpected beginnings of his professional career.“I’m already beyond what I was dreaming about at that point in my life,” he said. His philosophy is that music is ""an expression of who you are,” rather than what a person hopes to become.At least one thing remains unchanged from that young, 13-year-old Washington to the 42-year-old he is today: his saxophone. Washington has continued to play the same horn his father gave him even before he had settled on music as a lifelong endeavor. Many artists spend their entire careers searching for the perfect instrument or equipment — but for Washington, it was love at first sight.“It is very, very, very rare. I play the same saxophone, same mouthpiece, even the same type of reeds,” he said. “I’m like the guy who married his high school sweetheart.”Kamasi Washington will perform at theCity Winery in Bostonwith vocalist Ami Taf Ra on May 9, 10 and 11."

The members of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts concert choir joined Bono and The Edge for their Tiny Desk performance.Kirsten Holmes and Jevon Skipper are both students at the arts-centered school in Washington, D.C, and received a call from their choir director about a month earlier with the opportunity to join the rock stars in performing.The two vocalists, who aspire to use their talents to dip into the worlds of gospel, opera and R&B music, agreed to the performance with a few other classmates and members of the choir.What's the big deal? It's a Tiny Desk! Enough said, right?The performance features four songs, including a version of ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of ""Walk On.""The performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender.Though that may not have immediately impressed Kirsten and Jevon as much as some others. The Gen Z duo admitted they weren't very familiar with the Irish crooners and their band.(I guess they never had to deal with the shock of an unsolicited album showing up on their iTunes one fateful morning in 2014.)What are they saying?On learning about Bono's existence:Kirsten: I had found out prior... but [because] my parents [know].Jevon: Not even my parents. My dad. Because I know my dad was like, 'Look them up!' So I look them up, and I see they performed at the Super Bowl. I'm like, 'Oh, they must be like big news if they're performing at the Super Bowl.'Kirsten: We're youngins. You know, we are young, so we're still learning and stuff, but it's just a wow moment.On meeting Bono:Kirsten:  [He was] really chill, like down down to earth. And I love how they weren't big headed, because I know how sometimes when you're in the presence of someone with a higher status, it could be really intimidating. And I didn't feel like any of us felt intimidation from them. It was just really like a learning experience. They were like, 'Well, what do you think will fit good in this part?'Jevon: One of our friends, by accident, didn't get the words right. So he accidentally sung the wrong thing. And Bono was like, 'Oh, wait, what did you do?' He was like, 'I like that, man.'It was fun. It was funny because we all knew it was an accident, but then we kind of went along with it and Bono liked it. So we just did it.On the joy of performing:Kirsten: It was amazing, really happy. I think my moment was just seeing the people's reaction, just to allow other people to feel the enjoyment of what we are gifted to do. And it was just really good.Javon: I guess I just like the feeling that I can make someone's day with the gift that God gave me.

Regulators had worked all weekend to try to find a buyer for the bank, which was the second-largest bank failure in history. Those efforts appeared to have failed Sunday.In a sign of how fast the financial bleeding was occurring, regulators announced that New York-based Signature Bank had also failed and was being seized on Sunday. At more than $110 billion in assets, Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.The near-financial crisis that U.S. regulators had to intervene to prevent left Asian markets jittery as trading began Monday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 1.6% in morning trading, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4%. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite increased 0.3%.In an effort to shore up confidence in the banking system, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC said Sunday that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be protected and able to access their money. They also announced steps that are intended to protect the bank's customers and prevent additional bank runs.""This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth,"" the agencies said in a joint statement.Under the plan, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including those whose holdings exceed the $250,000 insurance limit, will be able to access their money on Monday.Also Sunday, another beleaguered bank, First Republic Bank, announced that it had bolstered its financial health by gaining access to funding from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase.In a separate announcement, the Fed late Sunday announced an expansive emergency lending program that's intended to prevent a wave of bank runs that would threaten the stability of the banking system and the economy as a whole. Fed officials characterized the program as akin to what central banks have done for decades: Lend freely to the banking system so that customers would be confident that they could access their accounts whenever needed.The lending facility will allow banks that need to raise cash to pay depositors to borrow that money from the Fed, rather than having to sell Treasuries and other securities to raise the money. Silicon Valley Bank had been forced to dump some of its Treasuries at at a loss to fund its customers' withdrawals. Under the Fed's new program, banks can post those securities as collateral and borrow from the emergency facility.The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses incurred under the Fed's emergency lending facility. Fed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.Analysts said the Fed's program should be enough to calm financial markets on Monday.""Monday will surely be a stressful day for many in the regional banking sector, but today's action dramatically reduces the risk of further contagion,"" economists at Jefferies, an investment bank, said in a research note.Though Sunday's steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, its actions are relatively limited compared with what was done 15 years ago. The two failed banks themselves have not been rescued, and taxpayer money has not been provided to the banks.President Joe Biden said Sunday evening as he boarded Air Force One back to Washington that he would speak about the bank situation on Monday. In a statement, Biden also said he was ""firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess fully accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.""Regulators had to rush to close Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution with more than $200 billion in assets, on Friday when it experienced a traditional run on the bank where depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once. It is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind only the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual.Some prominent Silicon Valley executives feared that if Washington didn't rescue the failed bank, customers would make runs on other financial institutions in the coming days. Stock prices plunged over the last few days at other banks that cater to technology companies, including First Republic Bank and PacWest Bank.Among the bank's customers are a range of companies from California's wine industry, where many wineries rely on Silicon Valley Bank for loans, and technology startups devoted to combating climate change. Sunrun, which sells and leases solar energy systems, had less than $80 million of cash deposits with Silicon Valley. Stitchfix, the clothing retail website, disclosed recently that it had a credit line of up to $100 million with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders.Tiffany Dufu, founder and CEO of The Cru, a New York-based career coaching platform and community for women, posted a video Sunday on LinkedIn from an airport bathroom, saying the bank crisis was testing her resiliency. Given that her money was tied up at Silicon Valley Bank, she had to pay her employees out of her personal bank account. With two teenagers to support who will be heading to college, she said she was relieved to hear that the government's intent is to make depositors whole.""Small businesses and early-stage startups don't have a lot of access to leverage in a situation like this, and we're often in a very vulnerable position, particularly when we have to fight so hard to get the wires into your bank account to begin with, particularly for me, as a Black female founder,"" Dufu told The Associated Press.Silicon Valley Bank began its slide into insolvency when its customers, largely technology companies that needed cash as they struggled to get financing, started withdrawing their deposits. The bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals, leading to the largest failure of a U.S. financial institution since the height of the financial crisis.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed to rising interest rates, which have been increased by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, as the core problem for Silicon Valley Bank. Many of its assets, such as bonds or mortgage-backed securities, lost market value as rates climbed.Sheila Bair, who was chairwoman of the FDIC during the 2008 financial crisis, recalled that with nearly all the bank failures then, ""we sold a failed bank to a healthy bank. And usually, the healthy acquirer would also cover the uninsured because they wanted the franchise value of those large depositors so optimally, that's the best outcome.""But with Silicon Valley Bank, she told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""this was a liquidity failure, it was a bank run, so they didn't have time to prepare to market the bank. So they're having to do that now, and playing catch-up.""___Rugaber and Megerian reported from Washington.

She wore a traditional embroidered blouse called asorochka.Abakumova came to the U.S. with her eight-year-old daughter in June as part of a special refugee program for Ukrainian citizens. They're now living in Sudbury, where she says the pine trees remind her of the place she grew up. Still, much of her family remains back in Ukraine.""And I hope everything will be alright,” she said. “And I hope this terrible war [is] stopped.”Life before the Russian invasion used to be normal, Abakumova said.""I had a lot of concerts, a lot of performances. I was enjoying life with my family,” she said in Ukrainian, as interpreted by Iryna Piotrowska, a Ukrainian woman who lives in Belmont, and whose idea it was to put on Friday's fundraising concert. “But on the February 24th, everything changed.""They left their home because Russian bombs were targeting cities, and they moved to a village where her in-laws lived. But they couldn't escape the war there, either.""We were hearing the loud noises of missiles,” she said through the interpreter. “So my daughter and I, we were spending time, days, in the bathroom. I was actually making her bed in the bathroom, and she was sleeping there because it was the safest place in the house.""They applied for the U.S. refugee program, and Abakumova and her daughter came to America in June, leaving her husband behind.

My husband was crying,” she said. “It was heartbreaking because we just don't know when we will see each other again.""One of the songs Abakumova will sing Friday is called ""Two Colors"" and is about a sorochka shirt like the one she was wearing. The song tells of a son leaving home, and his mother sewing him a red and black sorochka.""Red symbolizes love and black symbolizes sadness,” she said. “It's very apt for the situation, for the current situation now, because it's all tied together: love, and black for sadness, for the difficult situation that we're in.""The idea to hold afundraising concertcame from Iryna Piotrowska, who grew up in Ukraine and now lives in Belmont, where she takes a Zumba dance fitness class in the large auditorium in the town hall where the concert will be held.

So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joinedMorning Editionhosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel:So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens?Daniel Medwed:So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain.Paris Alston:Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations?Medwed:Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident.Siegel:Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts.Medwed:Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts.Alston:So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you?Medwed:Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action.Siegel:But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident?Medwed:And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 — It's not a huge fine but you can get fined — if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that.Alston:So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope?Medwed:There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter.

Let’s partner with a Boston band that can bring young people’ — meaning, like, 40-year-olds,” said Adam Gardner, the band’s guitarist.“This was our first-ever orchestra show, 18 years ago,” frontman Ryan Miller chimed in, estimating that the band had performed with the Pops about a dozen times. “And then Keith walked in yesterday. I don’t know if he said this, but in my mind, he was like, ‘Oh, time is a cruel mistress.’ He looked at us and his own life flashed before his eyes.”The band members also took the time to address their friendship and fans.“We’ve been having a blast for 30 years now — and if we weren’t, we probably wouldn’t be doing this,” drummer Brian Rosenworcel said. “We keep the relationships strong. If you’re communicating and your friendships are strong, you’re gonna want to make music together.”“A lot of it, too is just having people that continue to show up to support the band,” Miller added. “Part of it for us, I think, is the amazement that every time we can put up a Tanglewood or a Pops or do three days at a festival that there could be 3, 4, 5,000 people that show up, that still cares about our music. We feel like we have to take this very seriously, keep trying really hard, to challenge ourselves, and really honor our relationships — and just try and make good stuff so they’re not embarrassed to wear their Guster T-shirts.”Tickets go on sale June 12 for Guster’s performance at the BSO’s Tanglewood. Later this summer, the band will headline its third annualOn the Ocean festivalin Portland, Maine, August 11-13."

The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including “population equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.”“[The council’s] primary objective,” Flaherty argued, was “population balancing” — which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city’s nine voting districts.Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city’s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures.“We didn’t need to do anything else,” he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council’s “rushed” adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection.The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor.Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.""I need to have this done by the end of April?"" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case.Flaherty’s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston’s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.“This case is ultimately about choices,” said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made “modest” changesto the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.An evolving casePlaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses,including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston.The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs.Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city’s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city’s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters.Councilor Arroyo, who wasstripped of chairmanshipof the city’s redistricting committee amid last year’s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday’s hearing and said his colleague’s testimony illustrated “just how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.”“I think it’s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs … and I think it’s pretty clear at this point that there’s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,"" he said.The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday."

One is a ground-based radar that allows pilots to see both vehicles and other airplanes on the ground. It also will alert the pilot and control tower if an airplane on final approach is not headed for the runway on which it is cleared to land. The other safety system is a network of runway status lights installed along taxiways and runways throughout the airport. They flash red and warn pilots of potential conflicts between planes taking off and landing.

And the impact of such a rampant practice is clear.“In any given state, you'll find about a quarter of the prison population are folks that have been sent to prison while on probation or parole, largely for a technical violation. Like speeding, or staying out past curfew, or going to a neighboring city, town or state,” Robert Rooks, CEO ofREFORM Alliancesaid onBoston Public Radioon Thursday.Rooks shared the story of his nephew from Philadelphia, who was on probation but had a job in New Jersey. He had to quit because his probation officer prevented him from traveling out of state.“Those are the types of decisions that people on probation, parole often have to face. It's just not fair. It's not connected or related to why they're on probation or parole. It's not real accountability. And we've been working to change this all across the country.”Established in 2019, the REFORM Alliance has passed 16 bills in 10 different states to change the way probation and parole works in the criminal justice system — states that range from Florida to Louisiana to California.“We are headed to Illinois in two weeks to pass our 17th piece of legislation. Our goal is to reform — transform — our nation's probation and parole system, to be one that moves away from its current trapdoor: from community to prison back to community,” Rooks said.According to Rooks, research indicates that prolonged periods of probation and parole hinder individuals' ability to reintegrate successfully into society.“Just imagine ... you’re out on probation or parole. You have a probation officer that you have to meet with, say, two days a week. ... Meet with your probation officer for an hour. And then you have an education course, sometimes drug education, sometimes it’s another thematic course you have to take for an hour. And then you have curfew at 6 or 6:30,” he said. “Where is someone to work? Where are you able to earn a living?”To address this issue, Rooks and others have been working on removing unnecessary barriers in states like Pennsylvania. Their efforts incentivize going to work or school to shorten the supervision period.“If you're on probation and you're enrolled in school, college or some kind of education program, you get credit to work time off of your probation. If you were working, you would get work credits to work time off of your probation,” he said.The REFORM Alliance was born after artist Meek Mill was reincarcerated for popping wheelies while he was on probation in 2017. A judge found out and sentenced him to two to four years in prison. This spurred the#FreeMeekMill Movementon social media.“It wasn't easy,” Rooks said. “Took six months to get him out. But when he got out, through his credit, [Meek] said, ‘This is not about me. It's about the millions of people on probation and parole all across this country that are free but not free’,”Rooks said.He credits Meek Mill for bringing attention to the issue of probation and parole.“I've been doing this work for 25 years,” Rooks said. “I've worked on sentencing reform. I worked on the death penalty. I worked on the war on drugs. This issue of probation and parole was seen as so technical that many folks in the field just missed. And he brought attention to it, and REFORM was born.”Meek Mill will be part of a panel at theNAACP’s 114th National Conventionhosted in Boston, as well as Robert Kraft, who is a founding partner of REFORM and sits on the board. Rook expressed deep admiration for Kraft and how his involvement helps REFORM’s reputation, saying that his involvement lends “tremendous credibility” to the organization.“Everywhere I go across this country, especially in the center part of the country, because we were founded in relation to Meek, much of our membership is on the coast, on the West Coast. But when I go to the center part of the country, guess who people ask about? They ask about Robert Kraft,” Rooks said.He explained that making change to such deeply entrenched systems takes time, especially with the layers of U.S. government bureaucracy.“The beauty and the pain of our great country is that, with something that has been built at the government level, you have to undo it by changing laws at the federal, state and sometimes county level. And that’s what we have in our massive justice system,” Rooks said.“Probation is a form of accountability, and we're not trying to take the accountability away,” he added. “What we are doing is saying that there's a better way to do it and as a way we can incentivize good behaviors.”Correction: A previous version of this story said 16 bills were passed in nine different states, but the correct number is 10 states."

Harris discussed recent Supreme Court rulings, Boston’s complex history in the legacy of civil rights, challenges to our democracy, the power of Black women voters, and her love for hop-hop music and former Boston mayor Marty Walsh. The transcript below has been lightly edited for clarity.Paris Alston:We caught up with Vice President Kamala Harris at the 2023 NAACP convention. We talked about Boston busing and the issues facing Black Americans today. Well, Madam Vice President, thank you so much for joining us here at the 114th NAACP Convention. We know that you could have been anywhere in the country, in the world today. So we appreciate you making time to be here.Now, I want to go ahead and set the tone here to let you know that we all have at least one thing in common, and that is love for Tupac Shakur. I know that's true for you because you are a Bay Area girl.Harris:It is true.Alston:And Jim in fact babysat him.Harris:You're kidding me.Braude:His mother was my paralegal when I was a young legal services lawyer. I can't believe she's bringing this up.Harris:Oh my goodness. Wow.Braude:We can talk after.Alston:Yeah, you have to hear that story. And I'm just a big hip hop lover, so that's for me, too.Harris:Me, too. And 50th anniversary, right?Alston:Yes.Harris:Although it's so funny, because people are now, you know, younger hip hop lovers are now talking about, Oh, you like the classic hip hop, right?Alston:Hey, listen, it's all relevant. It all builds on one way or another, right. So why was it important for you to be here at the convention today?Harris:Well, first of all, I am a lifetime member of the NAACP, and so we can start with that. And for a number of reasons, I am. But also Boston's relationship to the work of this organization is historic. Boston was the first chartered chapter of the NAACP. This is the I'm told, the first time in 40 years that the convention has been held in Boston.And, you know, you combine all of that with this moment in time.Alston:Yeah. I mean, let's talk about that, because we know that part of the reason it took so long for the convention to come back to Boston is because the last time that it was here in 1982 was right in the aftermath of the 1970s’ busing crises which helped earn Boston the racist reputation that it has around the rest of the country.Now, you're familiar with busing. You are a product of that. We know that from that moment that happened between you and the president during the 2020 presidential debates. But where does Boston, a changing Boston fit into the current landscape of civil rights?Harris:Well, let's first talk about the moment we're in and then put it in that context and the moment that we are in and our country is that I believe there is a full on attack against hard won, hard fought rights and freedoms. And this is a moment in time that we need to recognize that that is, in fact, taking place.And then do what we must to renew ourselves to the work that took place here in Boston those many years ago. That was about coalition building. It was about fighting for the foundational principles of our country. It was a fight that was fueled and in so many ways based on love of country and our true and earnest belief in the promise of our country.And so when I think about us being here in Boston, in the midst of the highest court in our land, taking a fundamental constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America. When I look at the attack on an educational system where there are those who would dare to suggest that enslaved people benefited from slavery.When I look at those who would suggest that it is a bad, if not horrendous idea to focus on issues like diversity and equity and inclusion. And I contrast that with the fight that originated here in Boston around education, around desegregation, around fairness, around justice. I think that it's a very good coincidence that we are here in Boston at this moment in time.Braude:We talk about the tsunami of rights reversal, Madam Vice President. We have a Supreme Court. Three of the Trump selections are in their fifties. Could be there 30 years, not just affirmative action, reproductive freedom. We've spoken about loss, climate justice, voting rights. The president [of the] United States has said no to what a lot of Democrats are calling for, expansion of the courts.If that's off the table in terms of the administration, what is on the table to stop, as I said, this tsunami that could go on for decades?Harris:Well, first of all, you know, the issue of the court has been a long standing priority for those of us who attempt to get people to vote. And often for many election cycles, the most important and the least persuasive is, I think, now because of these recent decisions by the court in the last couple of years — well, you could argue since 2013 — shall be the holder which gutted the Voting Rights Act, that there is a renewed understanding of the importance of that court and the connection between that and elections.Harris:So part of it is we have to remind people that elections matter and not only elections that are about the United States Supreme Court, but the federal judiciary as a whole, which is the feeder for the Supreme Court, local elections, and in particular things that are happening that affect the rights and justice for people at a local level as much as at a federal level.Braude:And you might argue that there's no greater segment of the population to whom it matters more than Black Americans. I think you would agree there wouldn't be a Biden-Harris administration had it not been particularly for Black women, but Black voters in general.Harris:There's no question about that.Braude:But the numbers are down there. The support is weaker. There was a poll in the Washington Post not too long ago where how have the Biden-Harris policies affected your life? 49% of Black Americans said they've made no difference at all. Are you worried about that? I mean, where's the disconnect?Harris:Well, that tells me that we have more work to do, which we are doing, which is to inform people about what we have achieved and to also thank them by reminding them that it was because they voted in historic numbers, Black Americans voted in historic numbers. Young voters are off the charts. It's historic numbers in the height of a pandemic in 2020.And here's what happened when they voted. They changed the whole terrain on the issues, for example, like what we are doing around the medical debt issue. Now, for the first time, we are capping the cost of insulin for seniors [at] $35 a month. For the first time, we are allowing Medicare to negotiate against the pharmaceutical companies for drug prices.We are finally addressing medical debt as a whole and capping prescription medication to $2,000 a year for seniors. We are dealing with issues like gun safety. For the first time in 30 years, we've been able to pass legislation that gets us closer to where we need to be about reasonable gun safety laws as it relates to background checks and things of that nature.We have done the work that has been about one of my passion projects, which is dealing and highlighting with the issue of maternal mortality. We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world and we have one of the highest rates of maternal mortality. Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die in connection with childbirth.And we have elevated this issue to the stage of the White House, so much so that I issued a challenge over a year ago that states would expand postpartum care from two months to 12 months. When I started, three states were doing it, now 35 are doing it. These are some of the many examples and the challenges.But it is it is absolutely a challenge. We will meet to let folks know that when they voted, it made a difference. There is a nexus between them standing in line and achieving this goal.Alston:Madam Vice President, you're listing all of these accomplishments that the administration has made so far. But we also know you mentioned young voters. I mean, that's my age group, 18 to 34. Right. But we know that patriotism is declining among that age group right now. So how do you make people confident about casting a reelection vote for the Biden-Harris administration in 2024, getting all of that?Harris:Listen, first of all, let's agree, folks got a lot going on. They are trying to get their kids to school. They are trying to get to work. They are trying to just get through the day. So I fully and our administration fully recognizes that we have to be able to talk to them where they are, which is why I'm traveling around the country, which is why today I'm in Boston and I was in Iowa yesterday.I'll be I'll be in Florida next week and talking with folks where they are and letting them know that we heard them and we continue to hear them about their highest priorities. So you look at, for example, young voters. I've been traveling the country, meeting with our young leaders who in particular are talking to me about the climate crisis.They turn me on to a term I've not heard before as to tell me how you all are thinking about the climate crisis. And they shared with me a term “climate anxiety.” They're concerned about their future in almost a doomsday fear about what might be within a couple of decades of now. They are concerned about whether they should have children, whether they should even try to buy a home, because what does the future hold for that prospect?So what did we do as an administration? First of all, we put ourselves back into international cooperation around things like the Paris Agreement. But more importantly, what we have also done is we have, by my calculation, invested $1 trillion over the next ten years in a clean energy economy that is about resilience, adaptation and what we need to do to get in front of this issue and for America to be a global leader on this issue.That is one example of an issue that is impacting young people who will be young voters when they see the connection between their vote and outcomes.Braude:Madam Vice President, you talked about fear. When you look at the numbers, tens of millions of people in this country, roughly 75% of Republicans, support a guy who's been adjudicated a sexual abuser, likely an insurrectionist. The number two man in the race is somebody, as you referenced, [who] believes apparently that slavery was a job training program. I mean, I know the goal is to get one more vote than the opposition, but isn't it dangerous, horribly dangerous, for this country when maybe 70, 80 million people support people who believe those kinds of things?Harris:I would not pretend to offer you a full and concise explanation for why people support the person you are referring to. I think there are a myriad of reasons. I also believe this, and I truly do. I have traveled our country back and forth, and when I'm sitting down with folks, whether it is in red states and blue states, and I will tell you, I've been in just about as many red states as I have blue states.As vice president, when you're sitting down in a one-on-one conversation with, for example, seniors, whoever they voted for or will vote for. Capping insulin at $35 a month, big deal to them. Student loan debt. That's not about a red state blue state thing. We're fighting to relieve student loan debt that. So I do believe that the American people as a whole recognize that true leadership is about lifting people up, not beating them down.And I'm not giving up.Braude:Before you go, one very quick thing. We were talking to somebody yesterday who says he's a close friend of yours, local guy. He said he visited you last week. So, on behalf of the people of Boston, we have a question: what do you actually see in Marty Walsh? What is that about?Harris:I love Marty. I love Marty.Braude:Why?Harris:You know why? I will tell you why. He is a Bostonian to his core in that, in my long experience with people from Boston, you don't take any B.S. You shoot straight. You call it for what it is. You've got heart, you've got soul and you love our country and you care about working people.Alston:And you started in the trenches. As a union laborer.Harris:Yeah. We started from the bottom.Alston:And now we're here!Braude:We'll tell Marty what you said. Madam Vice President, we really appreciate your time. Thank you so much.Harris:Thank you both. I appreciate it."

Two kitchens. Two grand pianos. A pipe organ. A bell tower. And, of course, the sanctuary. It has curved wooden pews and tall, stained glass windows.Kenya Lazuli is now in charge of all this space. ""I still come in here, and I'm like, ‘What, we get to use this, whenever we want?’"" she said, as she walked through the sanctuary.Lazuli is from Corinth and works for theNortheast Farmers of Color Land Trust, which took ownership of the building at the beginning of the year.She’s converting a sunny meeting room into a library, a basement room into a tool lending library. She plans to renovate the 1950s-era kitchen into a commercial-grade space. She found a popcorn machine on Craigslist for an upcoming movie night.Despite these changes, Lazuli said the church already has most everything they could need.""It has all the chairs and tables even,"" she said. ""All the bathrooms you need, it’s accessible for mobility devices. It’s set up already to be a community center.""The community center she's building is still in its infancy. It doesn’t yet have a name, and they had their first public events this month — an open house and a tool drive. The vision for this space is clear, though.""There are lots of places to gather that white-led organizations either own or run that don't feel safe or welcoming to communities of color,"" Lazuli said.""The whole point of this place is to be welcoming to communities of color, and anyone else who needs a space to gather or wants to have an event or anything.""For much of its history, the church has been a place for community gatherings. Throughout the 20th century, it hostedmusic and folk dancingclasses,buffet suppers,Halloween parties, and hymn festivals that drew crowds of overfour hundredpeople. Part of the appeal was where it’s located.""There was a store in town, sawmill in town, all that kind of stuff. So people drove by it, and saw it, and went to it,"" said Brigid Farrell, a retired principal from Norwich and the part-time pastor of the church.Farrell says over the years, the community changed. The mills closed. I-91 went in. A bridgethat connected the townto New Hampshire came out. And younger generations stopped going to church as much.When Farrell came to the United Church of Thetford five years ago, it was no longer a bustling place. About 30 people regularly attended services, and they wanted to make a change.The church had enough money to maintain the building, but after lots of deliberation, they decided that wasn’t what they really cared about.“It was like, ‘Well, what is God calling us to do?’” said Farrell. “Once we got to that point, it really wasn't a hard decision to get rid of the building.”What they wanted was to have the building serve the community. It couldn't be converted to housing units, and they didn't want to sell it — it's worth about $150,000. So they started looking for a new owner. They reached out to arts organizations and posted messages on a town listserv. That’s how, eventually, they connected with Lazuli, who pitched using the building as a community center.“Because this space is here and not being used, it's like finding a secret treasure,” she said. “We just need to open it up.”For her, the church is the start of a much bigger project she dreamed up years ago: Forevery town in Vermontto designate a piece of healthy land for stewardship by people of color.Lazuli does not expect to reach this goal in her lifetime, but she says the effort feels essential.“This project is based in reparations, and beginning — just beginning, scratching the surface — of a way to repair for past harm that has been perpetrated against people of color, specifically Black and Indigenous people in this country, but also in the state,” she said. “This state is my context. So that’s why this project is happening here. But there’s a lot here.”The church in North Thetford is their first land donation. Lazuli did not originally expect the project to include a church, but she says it makes sense that their first piece of land is for everyone.As for the congregation, they’ll keep meeting in the sanctuary once a week. They’re looking forward to see the building used for more than a couple hours on Sundays.Lexi Krupp is a corps member forReport for America, a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on under-covered issues and regions.

Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.“Fare-free buses are better buses”, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. “It really does add up, especially for lower income households.""The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered “transit critical,” meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds.“These routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,” Franklin-Hodge said. “If there’s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it’s the people who need it most.""While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders.“I go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it’s on a straight route,” one rider who participated in a focus group said. “The 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister’s house.”A recent GBH news reportanalyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.“It reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,” Franklin-Hodge said. “We have video. You can see, at some of the big stations … the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.”The fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It’s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future — and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.“Where can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?” Franklin-Hodge said. “We’re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.”"

It’s not the only one of its kind.“That was shocking to people because they understood that that was minimizing what enslavement was all about. But the whole point ... of anti-wokeness is to fundamentally change the story of the continuing relevance of enslavement and segregation,” Kimberlé Crenshaw said onBoston Public RadioMonday.Crenshaw, the co-founder and executive director of theAfrican American Policy Forum, says that many members of the public see the topline problems of censorship, but they don’t see how deep the problems go. Recognizing the intersectionality of the issues of race, gender and ideology, she says, is key to addressing the ongoing attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion — and Black history, in particular — in education.It’s an issue she also sees in colleges, such as the recent affirmative action ruling from the Supreme Court that dictated universities can no longer use race-conscious admissions. So far this year,40 billshave been introduced across the country restricting colleges from having offices and staff devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion. Of those, seven have become law in North Dakota, Tenneesse, Florida and Texas.As more bills aimed at restricting diversity efforts in schools and the teaching of Black American history are proposed in statehouses across the nation, Crenshaw says these measures' effects will last far longer than the politcians who introduced them.""It chills teachers not to teach this material. That is still going to be on the books. That will last long after we don't even remember who [Gov. Ron] DeSantis was. That's what we have to wake up to,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's not just about 2024, it's really about the rest of this century.""Crenshaw created the concept of intersectionality and isone of the scholars behind critical race theory. Critical race theory is, in part, an academic framework tolook at institutional racial biasrather than individual actors. In many corners, critical race theory — often shortened as CRT — has become an imprecise catchall for ideas or parts of American history that some would rather not see taught in schools.But the exact definition doesn't matter, according to Crenshaw. She said that right-wing outrage over CRT is less about the specific material being taught and more about the loss of identity among white individuals.""Most of those people who are upset, going to a school board meeting, saying 'I don't want CRT in schools' — they couldn't define that. Racial justice, diversity, they couldn't define it. But they don't have to. All they need to do is be wound up with the message that: this is something that's taking something away from you,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's getting people upset about what they feel they're personally losing. And it's not necessarily material, it could be psychological. It is: 'We [white people] are no longer the center of American story, we have to share it with other people — and we have to share it with other stories.'""In Feburary, after backlash from conservatives, theCollege Boardexpunged the topics of intersectionality, critical race theory, the queer experience and more from its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies. The move was highly criticized by civil rights advocates, including Crenshaw, and the College Board later walked it backin April.""We need to not racially appease. We need to realize that there's a long connection between racism and fascism and anti-Blackness — we're seeing it play out now,"" Crenshaw said.She says that putting up resistance to restrictions on Black education is vital.""We need to recognize that when we see the likes of DeSantis, and others, coming after modest changes in the story that we tell about ourselves, that is calling us to defend the full narrative of the U.S. They're coming after those of us who value a multiracial democracy, so we need to show up as well,"" she said.Crenshaw will be participating in a panel Tuesday in Boston during the annual NAACP convention."

People experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder have received medical care and housing at the hotel since a sweep of a nearby homeless encampment in December 2021.A Boston Medical Center clinic at the formerly abandoned hotel will shut down by the end of March, according to a spokesperson for the medical center. The clinic currently provides area residents with access to clinical staff, methadone clinics, emergency triage and resources to cope with withdrawal and intoxication — all efforts to reduce strain on nearby emergency rooms.The city will continue to provide transitional housing at the Roundhouse Hotel until the end of June, and is currently “looking for other sites to decentralize” while “evaluating what options are available to us” in the interim, according to a spokesman for Mayor Michelle Wu.“Any reduction in services is going to negatively impact the population of people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs,” said Azzy Mae, a harm reduction activist and member of the New England Users Union, a local advocacy group for people who use drugs. “With the warmer months approaching, it’s important that the services are near where folks are congregating. It’s definitely not the time to be reducing services.”The closure comes after months of stalled negotiations between Boston Medical Center and neighborhood groups on a memorandum of agreement about a long-term plan and final end date for services at the Roundhouse.“It’s not that the services aren’t necessary, just not there,” said Sue Sullivan, executive director of the Newmarket Business Association, who suggested the creation of an “enclave” of housing and clinical support in another part of Roxbury, Dorchester or South Boston. “I see loitering, vandalism and aggressive panhandling.

Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House.The verdict was announced in a federal courtroom in New York City on the first day of jury deliberations. Jurors rejected Carroll’s claims that she was raped, but found Trump liable for sexually abusing her.Hours earlier, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan read instructions on the law to the nine-person jury before the panelbegan discussingCarroll's allegations of battery and defamation shortly before noon.Trump, who did not attend the trial, has insisted he never sexually assaulted Carroll or even knew her.Kaplan told jurors that the first question on the verdict form was to decide whether they think there is more than a 50% chance that Trump raped Carroll inside a store dressing room. If they answered yes, they would then decide whether compensatory and punitive damages should be awarded.If they answered no on the rape question, they could then decide if Trump subjected her to lesser forms of assault involving sexual contact without her consent or forcible touching to degrade her or gratify his sexual desire. If they answered yes on either of those questions, they will decide if damages are appropriate.On defamation claims stemming from a statement Trump made on social media last October, Kaplan said jurors needed to be guided by a higher legal standard — clear and convincing evidence.He said they would have to agree it was “highly probable” that Trump's statement was false and was made maliciously with deliberate intent to injure or out of hatred or ill will with reckless disregard for Carroll's rights.Meanwhile, Trump posted a new message on social media, complaining that he is now awaiting the jury's decision “on a False Accusation.” He said he is “not allowed to speak or defend myself, even as hard nosed reporters scream questions about this case at me.”Trump said he will not speak until after the trial, “but will appeal the Unconstitutional silencing of me ... no matter the outcome!”Trump never attended the trial, which is in its third week, and rejected an invitation to testify, which the judge extended through the weekend even after Trump's attorney, Joe Tacopina, said Thursday that his client would not testify.Tacopina told the juryin closing arguments Mondaythat Carroll's account is too far fetched to be believed. He said she made it up to fuel sales of a 2019 memoir in which she first publicly revealed her claims and to disparage Trump for political reasons.Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, cited excerpts from Trump's October deposition and his notorious comments on a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which he said celebrities can grab women between the legs without asking.She urged jurors to believe her client.“He didn’t even bother to show up here in person,” Kaplan said. She said much of what he said in his deposition and in public statements “actually supports our side of the case.”“In a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself,” she said. “He knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll.”Carroll, 79, testified that she had a chance encounter with Trump at the Bergdorf Goodman store across the street from Trump Tower. She said it was a lighthearted interaction in which they teased each other about trying on a piece of lingerie before Trump became violent inside a dressing room.Tacopina told jurors there was no reason to call Trump as a witness when Carroll can't even recall when her encounter with Trump happened.He told the jury Carroll made up her claims after hearing about a 2012 “Law and Order” episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store.“They modeled their secret scheme on an episode of one of the most popular shows on television,” he said of Carroll.Two of Carroll's friends testified that she told them about the encounter with Trump shortly after it happened, many years before the “Law and Order” episode aired."

Ryan requested the independent investigation by a judge last month, a move that family members and local officials hope will offer clarity and transparency.Faisal was a 20-year-old UMass Boston student and Cambridge resident, who appeared to be having a mental health crisis when he was killed on Jan. 4. He allegedly approached officers with a knife and was shot.Barbara Dougan, legal director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is representing Faisal's family and said the family welcomes the inquest.Unlike a grand jury investigation, family members — and officers involved in the shooting — can be present for the process. Judges can summon witnesses and examine relevant documents, often in coordination with the district attorney. Inquests typically take several months to conclude, after which the district attorney reviews the judge’s report and decides whether to pursue charges or not.“It’s going to be a process that's going to play out, a long-haul process that we're going to need all the support they can get,” Dougan said. “I guess if there's any goal, it’s not only to get justice for their son, but to prevent any other family from going through something like this.”In Massachusetts, all officer-involved shootings are investigated by county district attorneys. Ryan’s office has made it a practice of requesting inquests into fatal police shootings in Middlesex County since 2018.The killing of Faisal by Cambridge policestirred a strong community response,reported protests in Bangladeshandan ongoing response from the city’s government.“It’s a very frustrating thing that [the inquest] is going to take a couple of months,” said Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem. “There’s a lot of frustrations in the community that this has happened, and the police report and other things are not yet public. ... But all of the evidence, everything that people want to see, will be public at the end of the day. And I think that what is good and bad about our legal process is that we are very, very thorough. And so it takes a long time.”Also unlike a grand jury, at the end of an inquest, a detailed report and full transcript of the proceedings are made public.“An inquest is far more independent and leads to more transparency after the fact,” Dougan said. “I mean, during the investigation stage of the inquest, it's all closed to the public, but after the fact a report is made public. So there's more transparency, more independence, hopefully more accountability.”Azeem outlined responses the city is taking, including the recent announcement of implementing a body camera program for police and alternative responses to emergency calls that involve people in a mental health crisis.“We’re also not waiting for the monthslong inquest process to conclude,” Azeem said. “I personally don't use the word ‘tragic’ because it makes it seem as though there's nothing you could have done. And I do think that there are things that we can do and we are doing.”Cambridge police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick told GBH News that the department has conducted a number of recent trainings. One in December 2022, the month before Faisal’s killing, was “designed to provide officers with more response options to help them de-escalate incidents” involving mental health crises. He highlighted that officers regularly receive training on issues such as domestic violence, elder abuse and LGBTQ cultural competency.“Our officers are trained and prepared to handle the evolving demands placed on them,” Warnick said in an email. “There are a number of noteworthy trainings that CPD has been at the forefront of across the region and country.”Warnick said regular training programs also included emphases on veterans and PTSD, fair and impartial policing and management of aggressive behavior.Azeem added that the city is exploring more non-lethal response options for police, including Tasers, which he says are currently not used by the department.“We are also looking at it in a different aspect as well, which is: how can we use increased mental health resources?” Azeem said. “You know, police perhaps should not be the first line of defense for a mental health call. And if we can prevent these calls from even happening in the first place, that would be wonderful.”Dougan said Faisal’s family is gratified that steps are being taken to decrease the likelihood of a similar deadly outcome with Cambridge police for someone in crisis. But, she added, that’s not their focus.“We’re not going to step in front of those folks who've already been working on this issue for years,” Dougan said, “[and] the family is not paying attention to body camera policies at this point. Other people are, which is good and we’re glad they are. But they’re just still trying to get through each day with this gaping hole in their lives, which is the loss of their only child.”"

A similar split was evident on the question of whether Warren should run again: 43% said she should, while 36% said she shouldn’t.But MassINC pollster Steve Koczela says when it comes to gauging Warren’s current prospects, those results might actually paint an inordinately bleak picture.“She starts off in a pretty similar place, honestly, to where she was in 2018,” Koczela said, referring to Warren’s last reelection bid. “Her polling, looking back at 2017, wasn’t particularly sparkling, but she went on and cruised to reelection.”In the 2018 general election, Warren faced former state representative Geoff Diehl — who had triumphed in a three-way Republican primary — and beat him handily, 60% to 36%.How the commonwealth’s changing GOP factors inKoczela’s caveat comes with an asterisk of its own: Diehl, who’d been an early supporter of Donald Trump, personified the Massachusetts Republican Party’s recent turn to the right and preference for ideological purity over electability. A few years after losing to Warren, when then-Republican Gov. Charlie Baker was still weighing whether to seek a third term, Diehl announced a gubernatorial bid of his own, seemingly undeterred by his Senate loss or Baker’s high statewide approval ratings. Baker didn’t run again, and Diehl lost the governor’s race to Maura Healey in a landslide.After a disastrous 2022 election cycle, the Mass. GOP ousted former party chair Jim Lyons andreplaced him with Amy Carnevale, who has vowed to rebuild it from the ground up. But Carnevale’s project is just beginning, and the Mass. GOP is still at a nadir in terms of influence and reputation. Against that backdrop, it’s not clear that any electable Republican capable of going toe to toe with Warren — who made a strong run for the presidency in the 2020 cycle — will try to unseat her next year.“We’ve seen quality Republican moderates run and win the governor’s office in Massachusetts,” said UMass Boston political scientist Erin O’Brien. “But the Massachusetts Republican Party has put out people like Charlie Baker, who was that popular governor, and run people like Geoff Diehl.“In the abstract, a moderate Republican could do well in Massachusetts,” O’Brien added. “But it’s only in the abstract, because that individual either doesn’t exist or has been forced out of Massachusetts politics.”In a text message, Carnevale told GBH News that she expects the party will field a credible challenge to Warren 2024, and that “at least two Republicans” are currently considering a run. She declined to identify them.Highly favorable among DemocratsWarren will also be boosted, in her latest bid, by high popularity among members of her own party — which make up roughly a third of the state’s voters. In MassINC’s poll, which was conducted in late January and early February, 68% of Democrats viewed her favorably and 69% thought she should run again. In March, anotherpoll, conducted by Change Research for Northwind Strategies, found that while almost as many people viewed Warren unfavorably as favorably, 30% viewed herveryfavorably — more than any other Massachusetts politician polled, including Baker.Those numbers suggest two things. First, in a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, Warren would benefit from a loyal core of supporters who would organize for her, give her money and show up at the polls. And second, anyone who might entertain the prospect of a primary challenge against Warren would face a daunting challenge.The timing of Warren’s announcement is also fortuitous. As bad as the crisis of confidence currently roiling the U.S. banking system is, it’s likely to be a political asset for Warren as she begins campaigning again in earnest.“That’s ... her bread-and-butter sort of issue,” said Shannon Jenkins, a political scientist at UMass Dartmouth. “That’s what she knows inside and out. She’s one of the foremost experts on banking policy in the U.S. government right now.”By renewing her calls for rigorous regulation of the banking industry, Jenkins added, Warren can bolster her standing with the progressive Democrats who make up her political base while appealing to other voters, as well.“Not a lot of people are pro-big banks, right?” said Jenkins. “It’s just kind of a gut reaction from voters.”Where Warren remains vulnerableDespite all these advantages, though, Warren has some weaknesses that are worth bearing in mind as the 2024 Massachusetts Senate race shapes up.Koczela notes that, when the MassINC poll was conducted earlier this year, Warren’s standing was relatively weak among younger voters, many of whom hadn’t yet formed an opinion of her. Within the state, she’s also more popular with well-educated voters and voters who live close to Boston.In an email, Tatishe Nteta, a political scientist at UMass Amherst and the director of the UMass Poll, noted thatsurveys he’s worked onshow a “steady majority” of Massachusetts residents approve of Warren’s performance, and that she’s been a reliable champion on student-loan forgiveness, income inequality and several other progressive causes highlightedin her campaign kickoff video.But Nteta also said Warren’s performance in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary — in which she finished third, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — suggests she could be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right.“Some will say that voters in Massachusetts voted strategically for a candidate that could win in a general election matchup with Trump, but some might view these results as evidence of Warren’s weakness among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and among independents in the state,” Nteta wrote."

About 2% of all unemployment payments, or roughly $30 million, were overpayments in Massachusetts in 2019, per the state’s Department of Unemployment Assistance. But chaos in the early days of the pandemic and short-term federal programs — rapidly built, executed and shuttered — made the money owed now at a magnitude that’s anything but normal.Administrative errors, fraud and confusion about who qualified for new, short-term federal programs led to billions being overpaid. After years of forgiveness efforts slowly whittled down that sum, the department is now trying to get $719 million back from taxpayers on this year’s tax refunds. The 112,000 claimants owe, on average, $6,400 to the federal and state government. Any tax refunds that would be given to a claimant will instead be put toward paying down their debt to the unemployment overpayments.“There has been tremendous outreach that has been done to date, especially through a campaign last year, to reach as many claimants as possible,” Lauren Jones, Massachusetts’ secretary of labor, told GBH News.But it still won’t put an end to the multiyear problem. There are tens of thousands more people whose money isn’t being taken out of their tax refunds this year — but the state still plans to recoup their money, so their time will eventually come.The conditions in 2020 created a “powder keg,” as Rory MacAneney, an employment attorney at Community Legal Aid, explained it.Overnight shutdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic created a sudden need that the state’s Department of Unemployment Assistance tried to fill, with help from new federal programs. The amount of money distributed in 2020 — a total of $21 billion — was 15 times more than what it gave out in 2019. More than two-thirds of the overpayments were tied to federal pandemic programs.“You’ve got the combination of: state workforce agencies aren’t able to work in person, they don’t have all their usual facilities, they are trying to learn how to do things remotely,” MacAneney said. “They’re facing a huge increase in the number of people who are applying for regular unemployment. And on top of that now, they’re also getting people who are applying for these pandemic programs, and each of the federal pandemic programs had its own sort of guidance.”Governments often take back unemployment overpayments through tax intercepts. But after a multiyear pause on such intercepts during the pandemic and a huge increase in the number of people filing for unemployment benefits, many are experiencing this for the first time.“I’ve had people who had no idea that there was an overpayment on their account,” MacEnaney said. “It’s from, like, 2015 ... and they’re just finding out now.”The 112,000 claimants whose tax refunds will be intercepted this year, if they’re not in the process of applying for a waiver, are the group that’s been extensively narrowed down and been contacted several times by the department, Jones said.“They never qualified for that one-click waiver program, nor did they take any action from all the previous attempts that we’ve tried through the additional relief programs that the Department of Unemployment Assistance has provided,” she said.Jones isn’t sure how much the state will get back with the refunds.“Every case is really going to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. And we also don’t know how much of a refund people would be eligible to receive,” she said.Another 59,000 people who collectively owe roughly $370 million are still on the hook with the state and federal governments. What sets them apart from those whose refunds may be intercepted is that theyqualified for a “one-click waiver” last year. But they didn’t click before it closed in October.They won’t have it taken out of their tax refunds as the state conducts more outreach to figure out repayment plans.Jones said that her department cannot reopen the waiver under state and federal law.Employment lawyers suggest that anyone facing a debt to the state applies for what’s commonly called a “hardship waiver,” which could wipe the balance they owe if their expenses are more than they’re earning — or if they meet other criteriaoutlined on the state’s website.Some still hope that the state will opt to forgive more of the money that’s owed.Lydia Edwards, a state senator representing parts of Boston, Winthrop and Revere, sees payments from the early days of the pandemic as a crucial tool that helped workers and businesses stay stable during a tumultuous time.She proposed a bill that would give the Department of Unemployment Assistance the power to waive any overpayments for “non-fault” cases: in other words, where the applicant was not at fault.“What I find abhorrent is that when there were true mistakes made — the person didn’t do this, didn’t try to defraud the government — they’re now being stuck with some bills I’ve heard as high as $50,000 to pay back the unemployment,” she said, saying such forgiveness would be similar to the governmentforgiving PPP loans.Jones did not take a stance on the bill.“We’d have to see how that plays out in the legislative process,” she said.Clarification: This story was updated to clarify that intercepts due to overpayments could have occurred after multiple years prior to the pandemic, as well."

All he got was “the run-around.”The vast majority of the roughly 6,000 men and women incarcerated by the state of Massachusetts will be released eventually, and top state officials agree that educating prisoners is key to helping them survive and stay out of trouble when they’re freed.“The best way to reduce recidivism and make somebody successful on the outside is through education,” said Department of Correction Commissioner Carol Mici in March at a roundtable discussion in Roslindale with about 20 corrections officials, volunteer educators and some formerly incarcerated men.But in reality only a minority of state prisoners are getting into classes. An incarcerated person is nearly four times more likely to be on a waitlist than enrolled in a class that could help them find work upon their release, according to data obtained by GBH News.Some 3,100 state prisoners — more than half of all those incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons — were waiting to get into academic, vocational or technology classes last fall, records show. About 850, or just 15% of prisoners, were actually enrolled in a class.And instead of boosting programs, the state Department of Correction is moving away from in-person classes and relying more on online learning, the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found.Last fall, the correctional department opted not to reapply for more than $2 million in state educational grants that support prison programs. Those state grants covered 80% of the DOC’s expenses for educational programs at a high school level or below, according to data compiled by a special legislative commission on correctional spending.State prison officials declined to be interviewed for this story, and failed to respond to document requests for details on some of the programs. Corrections officials also declined to appear before the state Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee last December to answer questions about education.Instead, the department sent a detailed statement Saturday saying that GBH News was missing critical context. They argue that many people in prison are not eligible for or even interested in taking classes, and others may be enrolled in social skills training or other pre-release programming that limits the time they have availble for classes. They also contend that the state is actively trying to expand educational opportunities.The lack of education and training programs is seen as a key failure in Massachusetts to preparing prisoners for life outside the walls — even as officials tout such education as important for their success. Several current and former prisoners, like Henriquez, and their advocates told GBH News they wait for years for training opportunities.Maria Valerio of Clinton says she requested data on waitlists because she was so appalled by the lack of opportunities for prisoners.“Massachusetts is such a highly educated state ... and we have so much money that we’re putting into the prisons. And yet you can’t educate people,” said Valerio, a prison activist involved with the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ. “I think it’s disgraceful.”Policymakers in several recent reports also point to structural racism in the system: theminiscule rates of inmates accessing college classes, almost noservices for young prisoners with special educational needsandlimited access to educational programmingdisproportionately affect prisoners of color.Even those who got some training maintain it’s insufficient. Jose Bueno, 36, told GBH News he was released on parole last year after 16 years in prison, in part because the parole board concluded he had “completed vocational training.” But Bueno says he was repeatedly denied access to other vocational classes that led to a professional certification.“I was on the welding program list for 10 years and ... I never got in,” he said. Instead, he went to work for a prison workshop that builds park benches and other commercial products. He says he learned useful skills, but he never received a certificate he was promised. “I was just, like, working in a sweatshop,” he said.Bueno said he has no documentation to show a potential employer that he had been trained in the work. A year after his release, he says he is still bouncing between temp jobs while trying to get a foothold in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. He says he can’t get stable housing until he gets a stable job.“I’m hanging on by a thread, you know, and I don’t know where to turn,” he said.An investment in tabletsAt the roundtable meeting in March, Commissioner Mici sold the idea of educating Massachusetts prisoners with tablet computers, pre-loaded with educational materials that they can use to study on their own. The state has already spent $14 million on the devices, which started being distributed last year.“When you’re in your room yourself, you can always be working on education. You don’t have to wait to go to that classroom Monday, Wednesday, Friday for an hour, because that’s unfortunately sometimes all you get in the department because of space, because of waitlists,” Mici said.The department said in its statement to GBH News that ""Tablets have not replaced any teachers for any of our programs and the goal is to accentuate the learning experience and offer more enrichment opportunities through programming on tablets.""But advocates and some current state prisoners said studying on a tablet falls way short of meaningful education.Dwight Williams, an inmate at the state prison in Norfolk, told GBH News that it’s almost impossible to use a tablet in a prison cell. “The WiFi sucks,” he said. “You have to stand out in the hallway to get a signal.”Ann Jacobs, former executive director of the John Jay College Institute for Justice and Opportunity at the City University of New York, said online programs can complement education. But she said they can’t do the work of a live teacher — especially for adult learners whose earlier school experiences often were negative.“We want to get knowledge and experience that’s going to equip us to get a job, do fulfilling work and make a living in the community,” she said. “A tablet-based education that you do on your own in a cell doesn’t do any of that.”Karen DeCoster, a former corrections education specialist with the state Office of Adult and Community Learning Services, also said most prisoners need to be in a classroom to benefit from education.“More than anybody, they need the opportunity to learn social skills, to learn how to interact with eachother, how to self-monitor and manage their behavior in group settings,” said DeCoster, who once oversaw educational grants to the DOC. “These are transferable skills for employment and further education.”Lizz Matos, the executive director of the local advocacy group Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, says the purchase of tablets is a “welcome development.” But the scale of the investment compared to DOC’s overall programming budget “should make clear that programming and education have not been prioritized.”“Tablets should be utilized to supplement out-of-cell programming, education, and vocational training that is robust,” Matos told GBH News in a statement. “We hope that DOC spending going forward will prioritize rehabilitative programming so that people can get out and stay out of prison.”Prisoners themselves are begging for more training. Ina reportdistributed in January by Prisoners’ Legal Services, men incarcerated in three state prisons complained that the DOC had cut back on vocational certifications for a series of programs — including welding, carpentry and plumbing — that could lead to stable jobs outside the walls.“There are classrooms in almost every DOC facility that regularly sit empty hours out of each day,” prisoners wrote. “It should be the goal of the DOC education division to have learning activities occurring in every classroom, at every available movement time, every day.”In the 2020 fiscal year, the state Department of Correction spent just 2% of its $732 million operating budget on programming for inmates, according to alegislative commission’s study of DOC spending.That study also concluded that the state corrections agency can’t clearly account for how its resources are used, or the outcomes produced.One side effect of the DOC’s decision to walk away from state educational grants is that it also spares the agency from oversight by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which has found major flaws in prison education programs.An internal educationdraft reportfrom 2018, obtained by GBH News, found that only 26% of incarcerated students enrolled in high school–level or below programs at five DOC prisons and five county jails made a “measurable learning gain,” like earning a high school equivalency certification. DeCoster, whose was based out of the state’s education department, said DOC officials bristled at such scrutiny.“It was really questionable whether or not a curriculum was being followed,” she said. “They would show us a written curriculum, but then we would see no evidence of it when we went in to monitor. So we would try to have conversations around what’s really happening here. And people didn’t like being questioned.”The department said in its statement that it walked away from the grants because the program was not really designed to be implemented in prisons and it required too much paperwork. Nevertheless, “The DOC continues to provide the same level services, classroom instruction, and programs to more than 800 learners without the grant.”Getting an educationThe Department of Correction does understand how to provide inmates a quality educational experience — and sees its value.Housed inside a pre-release center in Roslindale is what the state calls its School of Reentry. The program, launched in 2016, is meant to immerse prisoners nearing release in education and an array of social services not generally available systemwide.“We found that around the DOC, a guy might get an educational program for an hour a day, or an hour a week. Whatever it was, it wasn’t enough,” the program’s co-founder Alan Spencer told a March roundtable of corrections officials, incarcerated students and some who had completed the program.Instead, the School of Reentry offers six hours of daily classroom instruction in subject areas that lead to the equivalent of a high school diploma, or a vocational training program in computer programming. Lasting up to 18 months, the pre-release prison facility also provides counseling for substance abuse, mental health and employment.Participants, sharing their stories at the event in March, said they were grateful for the chance at an education.Roberto Rivera said when he was incarcerated at MCI-Norfolk, there was no education available, only waitlists. And Kenneth Gumes said he’d been in and out of Massachusetts prisons for more than 20 years before winning a spot at the Roslindale program in 2017 — which has helped him stay clean and sober.“I never got any rehabilitation until they invented the School of Reentry,” he said at the roundtable. “The Department of Corrections didn’t do too much for me but house me and throw me back out in society.”State data show results are promising. More than 80% of students who have attended the program earned a high school equivalency. And of those released to the community from the program, only 9% ended up back in the criminal justice system.This is far below the state’s 33% recidivism rate over three years. And also not surprising: Nationally, prisoners who receive education or vocational training are 43% less likely to be put back in prison in that timeframe and stand a better chance at finding a job than their peers who didn’t see such opportunities, according to a2013 RAND Corporation report.“We’re getting them ready to hit the streets. We’re getting them ready for life beyond here,” said Lisa Millwood, the School of Reentry’s director. “It gets started while they're here so that we're able to provide all the support, love and care that they need before they have to do it on their own.”But the reach of the School of Reentry is limited. So far only 100 students have graduated. The school has room for just 25 people and has only run four cohorts since opening. The Department of Correction intends to double the capacity of this program, but that will still serve just a sliver of the total population.At the same time, officials from universities across the state tell GBH News they are practically banging on the prison doors trying to get in to teach eligible students.Last fall, 213 incarcerated people in Massachusetts state prisons were taking some college-level courses from five colleges and universities running programs behind bars, according to areportfrom The Boston Foundation. That’s less than 4% of the total incarcerated population.“It has been a missed opportunity,” said Mneesha Gellman, who directs the Emerson Prison Initiative and was a signatory to the foundation’s report. “We are, in this state, world-famous for higher education, and yet we’re not extending that even when the benefits of higher educational access for incarcerated people are so clear.”One of the biggest barriers is the lack of dedicated learning spaces inside DOC prisons, the report found.Basic needs such as classrooms, libraries, computer labs, and meeting space for office hours with professors would be available if prison leadership saw higher education as a priority, the report said. Authors also found that the DOC practice of suddenly relocating or reclassifying prisoners disrupts learning and enrollment.Jose Bueno was one of the lucky ones: he got a college degree in prison. Bueno says he got into the classes taught by Boston University, but that was largely despite, not because of, the Department of Correction. “That was B.U. on its own. And I had a push for that. I had to get it on my own,” he said.And then DOC staff told him that the degree disqualified him from the prison’s vocational classes, classes he believes would be more useful to him now that he is desperate to get a job with no real resume.Bueno said he considers his college degree a huge accomplishment. “That is the one thing in my life that I am truly proud of,” he said. “It built up my confidence to where I know I can learn how to do anything.”But he said that it has been no help in trying to find a job since leaving prison.‘Hollowed out’Massachusetts pales in providing college classes to prisoners compared to some nearby states. In Maine prisons, the per-capita rate of inmates taking college classes is four times higher than Massachusetts, based on data provided by the Maine Department of Corrections. And in New York’s prison system, the rate is two times greater than Massachusetts, according to New York state numbers. (New York has far more prisoners than Massachusetts, and Maine has far fewer.)It wasn’t always like this. In the nearly four decades that former prisoner Joseph Jabir Pope was incarcerated inside Massachusetts prisons, he says he watched the state gradually abandon education programs.“The programs that are available, for the most part, ... are hollowed out,” Popetold state lawmakers last Decemberat a Joint Judiciary Committee hearing on criminal justice reforms.In 2004, a corrections reform commission created under then-Gov. Mitt Romneydocumentedhow prior administrations had rolled back educational programs in state prisons.In 1991, Gov. William Weld moved the corrections agency from Health and Human Services to what is now the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. The move came in the midst of a tough-on-crime approach and marks what prison reform advocates say was DOC’s shift from a rehabilitation model to one focused on punishment.“[T]he DOC cut back in-prison education and programs significantly, which resulted in the layoff of 36 full time teachers and the elimination of several vocational programs,” the Romney-era report stated. “The Commission heard repeatedly that since the deep program cuts, the demand for education and programming has greatly outweighed the supply.” The 19-year-old report went on to criticize the changes, saying that it failed to reflect “’what works’ in successfully preparing offenders for law-abiding lives post-release.”There’s renewed hope for expanded opportunities for college education behind bars with the return of federal Pell Grant funding for the incarcerated. The federal money, which was taken out of prisons under President Bill Clinton, will be restored this July. But only if corrections agencies removebarriers. For one thing, the programs need tomeet federal criteriafor prisoners to receive the grants. The department says it is expanding college classes, but the physical infrastructure in prisons provides limited classroom space.State Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a chair on the judiciary committee, told GBH News that the DOC has a track record at the “superintendent level” of resisting expansion of college programming inside its walls.“There’s just this cultural sort of opposition to more education,” he said. “When colleges have tried to expand in some of our prisons, they’re just either met with silence or opposition.”Eldridge also said many programs are lacking in real-world needs.“Why aren’t there programs to train people to go into clean energy or solar installation, higher-level trade jobs, computer programing?” he asked. “Those are jobs that clearly the workforce is in need of.”WATCH: Reentry school preps inmates to leave prison — if they can get a spotAristides Henriquez, who said he is unemployed and seeing a mental health therapist for PTSD, agrees. He said people returning home from prison need these skills to build stable lives in their communities. Otherwise, they are tempted to fall back into selling drugs or other criminal activity.“You end up doing such a long time and it’s like, at least if you could learn something there, you would have a fighting chance when you get to the street,” said Henriquez. “You get back out here and you're stuck not knowing anything — the same as you went in. And then it becomes a reoccurring thing, going back into the prison system.”Have a tip or a comment about education in prisons, or reentering society after prison, in Massachusetts?

In his acting roles, like for HBO’s cult-hit “Search Party,” he spends a lot of time “playing gay, psycho monsters” in rude, edgy shows.But in stand-up, Early has a chance to be more warm, a style that will be on display at his live show — called “John Early Live!” — at The Wilbur on Wednesday night.“It's really, really nice in stand-up to be a little more ... generous and tap-dance-y,” he said. “I get to use some of my Southern hospitality.”He found his comedic partner in Kate Berlant in New York City as they both performed their way through the New York stand-up scene. The two met in 2012 and immediately connected.“It’s, like, the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me,” Early said. “We just totally fell in love.”Berlant and Early developed their own shared comedic language and began writing and performing comedy sketches onYouTube. “All our work just kind of comes from endless hanging out and making each other laugh,” Early said. Last year they starred in Peacock’s “Would It Kill You to Laugh?”.They each have their own careers — Berlant recently headlined herone-woman showand acted in Amazon’s “A League of Their Own” reboot — but Early said they continue to collaborate: “We always have kind of one foot in our collaboration and one foot in our solo work.”"

It's a signal that someone may have been using, and could continue to use, seniors' Medicare information to improperly bill the federal government.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General has received complaints from around the country about unsolicited tests being billed to Medicare, said a top investigator. Earlier this year, the office posted a fraud warning on its website, urging consumers to report this and other covid-related scams.""Unfortunately, most of these schemes are the result of bad actors receiving stolen Medicare beneficiary information,"" Scott Lampert, assistant inspector general for investigations, tells KFF Health News.Medicare numbers on the dark webBeing targeted once can mean a person is vulnerable to future scams. A stolen Medicare number can be used repeatedly to get payment for all kinds of things or sold to other fraudsters, says María Alvarez, who oversees New York state's Senior Medicare Patrol. The organization helps identify and educate beneficiaries about Medicare fraud throughout the country.""If you have someone's Medicare number, you can bill Medicare for procedures, tests, drugs, services, and durable medical equipment,"" Alvarez says. ""On the dark web, Medicare numbers are more valuable than credit card or Social Security numbers.""One beneficiary in Indiana suspected something was amiss after receiving 32 unrequested tests over a 10-day period, says Nancy Moore, the Senior Medicare Patrol program director for Indiana. None of the people who submitted a complaint recalled giving out their Medicare number, she said.In another variation of the problem, Medicare paid for tests for some Ohio beneficiaries who never received them, says Lisa Dalga, project manager for Ohio's Senior Medicare Patrol.""Information is the commodity of the 21st century,"" says Moore, who said she urges beneficiaries to guard their Medicare numbers.It is possible that some unwanted packages were a mistake, after pharmacies or other suppliers turned a one-time request into a continuing monthly order, a switch allowed under the program's rules that beneficiaries were responsible for correcting.Complaints around the countryAlong with those from New York, Indiana, and Ohio, Senior Medicare Patrol directors in Tennessee, Texas, and Utah told KFF Health News they noted a rise in complaints about the unwanted tests as the benefit's cutoff date approached.Alvarez says lately test suppliers had ""gotten more aggressive,"" calling and emailing seniors — something legitimate Medicare representatives do not do — as well as running misleading internet ads.When the COVID-19 public health emergency ended on May 11, Medicare stopped paying for over-the-counter tests, though it continues to cover those provided in a clinic, doctor's office, or other health care setting and processed by a laboratory. Some private Medicare Advantage plans may continue paying for the at-home tests.Medicare spent $900.8 billion providing health coverage to 64 million beneficiaries in 2021. But the program loses as much as $90 billion a year to fraudulent claims. Some of the more well-known scams have involved medical equipment like power wheelchairs.Sara Lonardo, a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, confirmed Medicare received complaints about unwanted tests but said they came from only ""a small portion"" of Medicare beneficiaries who received tests.Last year, President Joe Biden's administration offered all households a limited number of at-home tests for free, increasing access to testing as part of its effort to combat COVID.A few months later, in April 2022, CMS decided to pay for eight tests per month for those with Medicare Part B outpatient coverage, including tens of millions of seniors, one of the groups most susceptible to severe illness and death from the virus. It was the first time the agency agreed to cover non-prescription, over-the-counter products at no cost to beneficiaries.In a statement last month, federal law enforcement officials said ""wrongdoers allegedly sought to exploit the program by repeatedly supplying patients or, in some instances, deceased patients, with dozens of COVID-19 tests that they did not want or need.""So far, prosecutors at the Department of Justice have confirmed only one case involving the testing scam. A doctor in Florida and a test supplier in Georgia face charges after they were accused of illegally paying an unnamed Virginia marketing company approximately $85,000 to obtain beneficiary numbers ""for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries throughout the United States,"" according to an indictment filed by the Department of Justice last month and obtained by KFF Health News.The indictment says the pair submitted more than $8.4 million in fraudulent claims for covid tests ""regardless of whether the Medicare beneficiaries had requested or needed the tests.""$94.08 for one test?Lampert declined to say how many complaints the OIG had received, adding, ""There may or may not be some other ongoing investigations that we just cannot discuss yet.""The details of several Medicare Summary Notices — quarterly statements of services beneficiaries received — obtained by KFF Health News show Medicare paid suppliers $94.08 for at-home covid testing using a billing code for ""a single test."" Most retail pharmacies sell a two-pack of tests for about $24.Lonardo said Medicare paid up to $12 for one test and that the number of covered tests was limited to reduce ""the risk of abusive billing."" She declined to explain why the Medicare Summary Notices indicated a payment of $94.08.Beneficiaries may be the best fraud detectives for preventing medical identity theft. Senior Medicare Patrol programs encourage them to look for any items on their benefits statements — like back braces and lab tests — that Medicare paid for but that they never received.If Medicare has paid for an item once, beneficiaries may not be able to get it when they really need it — regardless of whether they actually received it.Diane Borton, a 72-year-old from New Smyrna Beach, Fla., has thrown out some of the expired tests she received but never asked for, yet she still has 25 tests. She said she called the 1-800-MEDICARE helpline twice about the unwanted packages but was told nothing could be done to stop them.Borton didn't pay for her supply, but that's not why she's concerned. ""I don't want my government paying for something that I'm not going to use and I didn't ask for,"" she said. ""I feel like it is such a waste of money.""People with Medicare or private Medicare Advantage plans who receive medical supplies they didn't order can contact the Senior Medicare Patrol Resource Center at 1-877-808-2468.KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Campbell shared the news amid a push from her office to raise awareness about legal protections for young people from labor abuses, especially in immigrant communities.“What we do see is a cross section of the children that are more likely to be exploited are children who live in low-income communities, immigrants, communities of color,” Campbell said. “That's not by accident, it’s the way systems are designed. That's where people go to exploit folks because of lack of information and language barriers.”The attorney general’s office is launching a child labor working group to “identify investigations targets” and develop new practices to enforce the labor laws on the books.Her office’s Fair Labor Division enforces the laws that govern youth employment. Within the past three years, the Office’s Fair Labor Division cited nearly 130 employers for violating Massachusetts child labor laws, with penalties totaling almost over $1.3 million. Those citations affected roughly 2,000 minors from across the state, according to Campbell. Her office later confirmed some of those employers subjugated immigrant minors to child labor exploitation.Between October 2021 to April 2023, over 4,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in Massachusetts, according tofederal datafrom the Office of Refugee Resettlement. This number doesn’t include youth who arrived with their families.Campbell said the settlement with Dave & Buster's included $275,000 in restitution to resolve allegations of labor violations in multiple locations, a figure that includes compensation for more than 800 employees. The company was cited for not providing meal breaks of at least 30 minutes to employees who worked shifts lasting longer than six hours, not obtaining work permits for minors before they began employment and by employing 16- or 17-year-old minors for later hours than permitted by law.The complaint was launched by a parent who alleged their child was made to work past midnight on a weeknight.A spokesperson for Dave and Buster's could not be reached for comment.“Even over the past year, multiple fast-food restaurants and dining establishments across the state have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for violating child labor laws,” said Liam Quinn, youth programs director at the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety. “These violations include young people working too many hours, working with deep-fat fryers, high-speed ovens, and have resulted in multiple youth being burned.”Campbell said her office is issuing a guidance to remind employers of labor laws to ensure minors are safe at work, including a reminder of the state $15 hourly wage for workers age 15 and older. Minors under 14 cannot legally work, with the few exceptions of babysitting, working as a news carrier, working on farms, or working in entertainment with a special waiver.Campbell says her office is also meeting regularly with immigrant worker centers and providing know-your-rights education to vulnerable communities. It recently sent letters to all state public school superintendents responsible for issuing work permits to minors and fact sheets in multiple languages to be distributed among guardians of high school students about the rights of immigrant workers and labor trafficking.According to Gladys Vega, the executive director of the Chelsea-based service organization La Colaborativa, parents are often behind the long hours their children work.“Sometimes parents don't know any different. Sometimes parents are worried about paying the coyote they need to pay whatever they left behind in their country wherever they borrow the money to come here. So everyone in that family has to work,” she said. Vega said that at least 250 children work in Chelsea alone, and often parents rely on their teenagers’ checks for utility bills.In one instance, Vega said a 15-year-old skinned his finger on a machine in the deli department of a supermarket while he was working in a position he wasn’t supposed to be working in. Vega said it’s essential that employers and parents both made aware of the stringent child labor laws."

Two of the people injured were teens, and police arrested one young person for alleged illegal possession of a firearm.Neenah Estrella-Luna, a sociologist in East Boston — who co-authored an Amherst College study last year about inequities in access to open space —said more multigenerational beaches is a good idea.She urged the beach commission and the State Department of Conservation and Recreation to go a step further, hiring older staff skilled in youth social work.“If they had people who've experienced detention and experienced incarceration, who are doing more anti-violence, anti-gang social healing work, they're going to have those calming presences on the beaches and in the park spaces that would help mitigate some of this [violence],” Estrella-Luna told GBH News.A report on beach accessibility released earlier this month by the Metropolitan Beaches Commission highlighted public safety but also concerns that heavy-handed police response could “unfairly target groups of young people who are simply trying to beat the heat and have some fun.”Revere resident Jacqueline Monterroso, who participated in some of the commission’s hearings last year, told GBH News she appreciates seeing the police because she’s grown increasingly concerned about safety at the beach.“I think we really need to address this,” said Monterroso. “If this is how it's starting and it's not even summer yet and schools aren't out yet, I’m really fearing what's to come in the next months.”In aseries of stories last year, the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting documented the uneven access to the state’s shoreline, partly because state law allows private property ownership of beachfront down to the low-tide line. Many coastal communities also impose parking and residency restrictions that dramatically limit beach access for non-residents. Such restrictions historically kept people of color from gettingaccess to the shoreand continue to do so, GBH’s report found.That leaves public beaches and those nearest public transportation, like Revere, as the only beach option for many city residents.Mancini and Monterroso both said they'd like to see improved transportation systems that could bring people to other beaches in state that are otherwise off-limits due to municipal restrictions. Such efforts could take some of the pressure off the urban beaches where parking lots often hit capacity early in the day.“These are in-demand places,” Mancini said. “They're being loved to their very limits,”"

Gelberg, who specializes in identifying unmarked graves, was there to identify the resting place of Mary Powell, who as a young woman introduced Martin Luther King Jr. to his future bride, Coretta Scott, in Boston.“So she's in this row right here,” Gelberg said. “That's where she is. She's between — I think that says — 'Withen’ and ‘Vanderwood.’ And that is her location right in front of us.”In Boston, you can hardly throw a stone and not hit a monument or grave marker identifying where a person of note is buried. But standing at the grave of the woman who brought together this iconic civil rights couple, there’s nothing whatsoever to indicate her significance in the world — or even her presence in it.“I just think it's sad. Somebody lived a life that deserves to be recognized. And even for people who don't know the person who's passed. It's very heartwarming, actually, to see the tributes,” Gelberg said, pointing to a sea of polished gravestones and inscribed words of remembrance for loved ones spread across the breadth of the cemetery. But there was nothing but snow-covered ground and a plot number in Gelberg's notebook to mark where Powell was buried. There was no name.""There's no name because there's no headstone,"" said Gelberg.Mary Powell: singer, teacher and community leaderThe Embrace, the new sculpture on Boston Common, was inspired by the story of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott coming together in this city. But in all of the celebration surrounding the sculpture's unveiling in January, little was said about the woman who introduced them to each other.Powell, a former Boston school teacher and and local opera singer, passed away from leukemia on Sept. 11, 1991, at the age of 76.An obituary published in the Boston Globe confirms that Mary Louise Powell founded ""World Day"" in Roxbury to assist children and the homeless. Powell, who graduated from Spellman College and the New England Conservatory of Music, had taught biology in Boston Public Schools for nearly 20 years, including several at English High.As a young woman, she'd been friends with both King and Scott. King was a student at Boston University. Scott and Powell were sopranos studying at conservatory. Powell also knew MLK from her association with 12th Street Baptist Church and the Urban League.The search for Mary LouiseThere aretens of thousands of unmarked and unengraved gravesitesof Black and Indigenous people spread across the United States, according to the African American Intellectual History Society. Identifying those graves has garnered more attention and scholarship in recent years.Gelberg came to know about Powell through a genealogy website that researches death records calledfindagrave.com,an internet site used by people all over the world to find burial sites. The platform relies on a community of volunteers to help pinpoint often difficult to find graves. In December,a stranger reached out for help to find the resting place of a former school teacher and opera singer in Boston who had changed her name to Mary Louise Gordon.“I happened to see a request one day that happened to have a deadline associated with it. And it was, I think, two days before Christmas, and he had a 24-hour deadline,” said Gelberg.The request came from Clennon King, a Georgia-born documentarian, historian and former Boston reporter, who for decades has researched Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott’s relationship. Clennon King lives in Georgia, returning there from Boston several years ago.Weeks before The Embrace sculpture was unveiled on the Common, 14 miles away, Gelberg picked up the telephone to inform King that MLK and Scott’s college friend has rested in near total obscurity since her burial. Clennon King said he found it sadly ironic.“Here is all of this hullabaloo around this courtship,” he said, “and the person who was really responsible for connecting them lies in an unmarked grave over in West Roxbury.”Clennon King, no relationship to MLK, had a second purpose in seeking to find out what became of Mary Powell.""What I was trying to do is to get a hold of her son,"" King said. ""Her son, believe it or not, lives in Boston. She had one child, and he lives in Jamaica Plain.""Mary Powell's only childMichael Powell, a tall, bearded man, looks younger than his 76 years suggest. Now retired, he's a former social worker who started a construction business later in life. He also describes himself as a proud father of five children. Over coffee in Jamaica Plain, he spoke adoringly of his late mother.""I say for a little Black girl born in 1915 from Atlanta, she had a great head on her shoulders,"" Powell said, smiling.He recalled how at his mother's funeral, the Rev. Michael Haynes, then senior pastor at the 12th Baptist Church and longtime friend of Martin Luther King Jr., delivered the eulogy before a small gathering of loved ones.Michael Powell remembers the many recitals he attended with his mother, who aspired to be an opera singer like her idol,Marian Anderson. But overcoming the racial barriers in classical music was extremely difficult. She was she not able to perform as widely as she dreamed. Michael said sometimes when the wind is calm, he can almost hear his mother's melodious soprano in the air.""She sang in the Gardner Museum, the 12th Baptist Church, the First Church in Roxbury. She was a singer, and I'm like 7 or 8 years old just tagging along,"" he said.Almost apologetically, Powell explains that the reason for his mother's unmarked grave is far more complicated than might be assumed, and that it has to do with his own mortality.“I purchased two graves there. I was going to make one stone for two graves when I passed away. So I just never deemed it to be something that I needed to do sooner than later,” he said.For years, the memory of his mother was the only inscription he needed. But in recent months, Powell says he’s come to realize that his mother’s story deserves to be shared with others.The introductionOn many occasions, Powell heard his mother detail her role in introducing the Kings.“Coretta and my mother were on their way someplace,” her said. “And Martin came by, and my mother introduces Coretta to him. You know, they chat for a little while and then they part. And then later that afternoon, my mother says he called her on the telephone, and he wanted to know who that lady — who Coretta — was. And that's how they met.”In 1953, Mary Powell drove with other friends through the Jim Crow South to Atlanta to celebrate the new couple, and then to Scott's hometown of Heiberger, Alabama, for the wedding.That fateful meeting arranged by Powell led to the love story that’s now honored on the Boston Common.Boston NAACP President Tanisha Sullivan suggests that the local community go even further by honoring Powell with a gravestone and prominent inscription.“As a community, we could work with the family to help get a marker in recognition of her serving as the spark that connected two of the world's most influential and impactful leaders,” said Sullivan.That's a gesture Michael Powell, Mary Powell's son, would welcome.""It's a great idea. I just think that it's a wonderful thing that the community gets to recognize and honor her, as she should have been,"" he said."

And when the mayor has threatened to have people arrested for speaking too long during the public comment period. Last year, councilors debated international nuclear weapon disarmament.“I don’t know what the heck that has to do with the city of Worcester,” said Hazard, who’s been regularly watching the city council meetings for more than four decades. “I’ll be honest, I’ve sat there a couple times laughing out loud and getting dirty looks from a couple of the councilors and the mayor.”She’s far from alone. Local journalist Bill Shaner calls himself the “Jane Goodall of the Worcester City Council” and organizes weekly council watch parties.“I kind of like to default to watching it like a reality show,” Shaner said. “Just sort of see the humor in all of it.”Traditionally, council meetings like Worcester’s are a way elected officials in Massachusetts cities and towns oversee local operations and pass new policies and laws. But Worcester’s meetings are unique because they can be an unpredictable spectacle.They often run for at least three hours and can involve long discussions about trash and rats, passive-aggressive barbs between councilors, and votes on issues as minute as whether to place asingle accessible parking spotin front of an apartment complex.“It could become a mess, a chaotic mess at any turn,” Councilor Thu Nguyen said. “There’s meetings where I’m like, ‘Oh this is going to be a 45-minute meeting.’ And the next thing you know, it’s three hours.”Unpredictable meetingsThe cast and characters of the “reality show” include all 10 councilors, the mayor, city manager and city clerk, along with guest stars from the public. Although the drama during the meetings sometimes involves more significant issues like housing or policing, it more often arises from drawn-out discussions of minute problems that impact small groups of people.Take the story of the Indian Lake watercraft ban. People with homes along the lake asked councilors to ban motorized boats and personal vessels, like Jet Skis, in 2021. And they did. When the ban came back up for renewal a year later, a city council subcommittee recommended councilors continue it. Instead, councilors delayed a vote on the issue using a procedural maneuver known as a hold. They then engaged in an hours-long debate over two meetings on the ban, which eventually passed 9-1.“People hold a lot of things and it just prolongs things,” Councilor Sean Rose said. “That can be frustrating.”Another common practice that takes up time? Shaner and Hazard said councilors constantly repeat each other during debates — even if they agree on the issue.“There's no way of knowing which item is going to be one of the items where everyone has to speak on it,” Shaner said. “There's a tendency for Worcester City Council to see themselves as deserving of the limelight that the position affords — that the point of the job is speech time.”While the time spent on random, less significant issues can be a form of theater for residents watching, Nguyen and Rose said the meetings take a toll. Nguyen, a first-term councilor in their second year, has suffered from anxiety as a result of the unpredictability of meetings each week. The councilor usually tries to manage through the meetings with coffee, chocolate or gummy bears.“It gets tiring,” Nguyen said. “It’s really hard to focus. Sometimes I just start doodling.”Rose added when he first joined City Council about six years ago, he was so excited for the meetings that he ran into City Hall for them. Now, it’s more like a slow “Army crawl,” he said.A lack of City Council staffWorcester councilors and officials attribute the length and unpredictability of the meetings in part to Worcester’s form of government. Unlike Boston and dozens of other cities where a mayor is in charge of all operations, a city manager is the chief executive in Worcester. City councilors and the mayor hire and oversee the manager.However, Rose said because council positions are part-time and councilors share just one full-time staff member, they have little time and assistance to supervise the city manager on a day-to-day basis. As a result, city council meetings are a main opportunity to seek information from the manager on mundane issues like pothole repairs and snowplowing.For comparison, city councilors in Cambridge and Springfield are also part-time positions, but both councils have more people working for them. The staff help the councils keep in regular touch with city leaders about municipal operations, letting councilors focus more on bigger policy issues during meetings.“[Meetings are] always extremely efficient,” Springfield City Clerk Gladys Oyola-Lopez said. “There’s always real work that’s getting done. … For [Worcester’s] council to not have a dedicated staff, that would be a huge problem.”Worcester City Clerk Niko Vangjeli haslooked into staffingin other municipalities at the City Council's request as a step toward possibly hiring additional staff. However, the council has yet to take action on the information.Some Worcester city officials and watchdogs say there are benefits to councilors meeting so often and discussing such a wide range of issues. David Rushford, who spent 37 years as Worcester’s city clerk before retiring, said the meetings help make the city’s government process more transparent.Still, he added that modifications other than hiring more staff may be necessary to help City Council meetings run smoother. He suggested councilors go along with subcommittee votes more regularly. Each committee consists of a different group of councilors. Too often, Rushford said, the council holds long debates on issues that a committee has already discussed and made a recommendation on — like the Indian Lake watercraft band.“The rules are [that subcommittee] is where the work is done,” Rushford said. “If the councilors are routinely taking up items in council that were already handled in committee, then they're making life miserable for themselves.”Idella Hazard, the longtime City Council watchdog, would appreciate more efficient council meetings. She values City Council as an essential party of democracy, and she walks 15 minutes from home to City Hall every Tuesday to send a message to councilors that the public is watching them. But sometimes she fantasizes about doing something else on a Tuesday night.“I would go to the library and do some arts and crafts there,” she said, adding that attending meetings every week is “exhausting.”"

The event, hosted by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, launched the group’s ‘Face Jewish Hate’ campaign in collaboration with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism.Robert Kraft, the 81-year-old founder of the foundation and owner of the New England Patriots, told the crowd that the America he sees today reflects Germany in the late 1930s.“We’re seeing neo-Nazis raising swastikas and demonstrating, saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and ‘down with the Jews,’” Kraft said. “This is the United States of America in 2023. There’s no room for that kind of hate — or hate of any kind.”The campaign features afive-point plan: Face Jewish hate, empower the community, build allyship, inform and educate the next generation and strengthen communal security. Those steps were determined by a task force of community leaders and experts on combating antisemitism with antisemitic incidents on the rise.According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were over3,600 reported antisemitic incidentsacross the country in 2022 — the highest number on record since the ADL began tracking the incidents more than 40 years ago. In Massachusetts, antisemitic incidentsjumped 41%from 2021 to 2022.Along with top elected officials like Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Attorney General Andrea Campbell, local Jewish leaders like Kraft addressed the crowd. Speakers stood in front of screens that shared stories of local antisemitic hate crimes, like that ofRabbi Shlomo Noginski, who was stabbed eight times last summer in Brighton outside of a Jewish school. Noginski attended the event but did not address the crowd.Dr. Jeremy Schiller, who, during his tenure as the Chair of the Salem Board of Health during the COVID-19 pandemic, received severalantisemitic messages and threatsfrom people who opposed vaccination and mitigation efforts.He said that, on top of his outrage and indignation, he also felt a growing sense of loneliness and isolation from the lack of attention to antisemitic hate during the pandemic.“If [antisemitism] is not called out, if our communities stay silent, then we enter into that same dangerous debate,” he said. “That’s sending me a yellow star or depicting me with a noose around my neck to my kids, or equating COVID mitigation measures ... to Nuremberg laws.”Members of other faiths also spoke on the resurgence of antisemitism locally and nationally. Cardinal Sean Patrick O’Malley, who serves as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, said he was stunned to hear Jewish leaders’ testimony at a joint Catholic and Jewish community event about the measures Jewish folks must take to practice their faith safely.“I was horrified to hear about how they have to have their services with doors locked in all kinds of security and cameras and armed guards,” he said. “Racism and antisemitism have always been the original sins of our country, and we must never let our guard down.”Correction: This story was updated to correct the misspelling of Rabbi Shlomo Noginski's name."

So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.""Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil.“What we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,” Vilar said.Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury.“In order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,” he said.Most produce won’t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said.“Typically when you start to put things into the ground and it’s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,” he said. “There are things that you can start early on — like peas — that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.”Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said.The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens.Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant — but not quite yet.Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners ofPemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont,said now’s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go.“We’re itching to get outside,” he said. “We are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale — all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost — so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.”Though most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold.“I appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,” he said. “This will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.”Most local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs — tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few — that will be ready to go into the ground.“Pansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,” Saidnawey said. “They'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.”Perennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: “Hellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.”Trees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it’s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.“By the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,” he said.It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens.“If you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,” Saidnawey said. “So it’s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.”People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said.Leftover containers from last season are still just fine, Saidnawey said. They may need some fresh soil, a bit of compost and new plants.“One of the greatest joys is to watch people walk into this place with a smile on their face,” Saidnawey said. “I mean, if you're walking into a plant store without a smile on your face, something's wrong.”"

Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state’s future, saying she sees a “big need” to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families.Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state’s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states.“We need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,” Healey said.As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up.Healey’s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey’s tax package — a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million — earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.""By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor’s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state’s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,"" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement.In an interview later Thursday on GBH’sBoston Public Radio,Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts’ tax policy more in line with other states.“Only 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, … we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,” Healey said. “But honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state.She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year.Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance.In other budget matters, Healey said she’s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education.She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. “We need to do everything we can to get rid of them,” Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country.Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people’s voices to the table and that she “might even have a youth council of my own” at some point.She said she’ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected."

He last came on GBH’sAll Things Consideredto discuss his idea that the strange, extrasolar object known as Oumuamua might have been an interstellar alien spacecraft. Since then, he’s become even more serious about searching for evidence of alien intelligence with his own organization and with the Pentagon. Loeb returned toAll Things Consideredand joined host Arun Rath to explain his research in detail.Arun Rath:First off, give us a little bit of context on where we are with this situation. It was last summer when the Department of Defense created a new office to track unidentified aerial phenomenons — what we used to call unidentified flying objects or UFOs. But could you briefly explain what’s going on here, and why the Pentagon decided to get serious about this?Avi Loeb:About half a year ago, the director of the new office in government that deals with anomalies wrote me an email and said that he is visiting the Boston area in the coming weeks and asked me whether I’m available to meet with him. I said yes, of course, and he came to my home. As a result of that, we wrote a scientific paper together in which we talked about the physical constraints that can be put on unidentified objects based on the limited data we have.In thispaper, we speculated about possible scenarios by which probes may be released toward the Earth; for example, from a mothership, because the second interstellar meteor had the same distance of closest approach to the sun. So more and more, I thought to myself, “Well, maybe it was released by a smaller probe released by a mothership.” But then it turned out to have originated from a different direction, and so they were not actually related.But in the paper with Sean Kirkpatrick, we mentioned the possibility that the mothership would come by or pass near Earth — just like Oumuamua did — and release a lot of probes that can visit different planets in the habitable zone.Rath:Based on what we’ve seen of some of these objects, I imagine there’s an argument to be made that this technology would be beyond any of our adversaries.Loeb:Not necessarily. I think the government is confused. It’s unclear what the nature of these unidentified objects might be.From a scientific point of view, the fundamental question is whether there is even one object that is of extraterrestrial technological origin. That’s what theGalileo Projectthat I established a year and a half ago is trying to find out.We have an operating observatory at Harvard University that we assembled over the past year. It has infrared optical cameras and a radio and audio sensor that are monitoring the sky 24/7. The data is being fed to an artificial intelligence classification software that tries to figure out whether any of the objects we look at are natural in origin, like birds, or human-made objects, like drones, balloons or airplanes.My approach to this puzzle is that rather than deal with past events that were anecdotally reported with compromised instruments that we can never revisit because the data was collected from months or years ago, it’s much better to have instruments that are fully under our control.After all, the sky is not classified; it’s only the sensors that the government used that are classified that make the data classified. The best data is not available to us, to scientists, or to the public simply because it was collected by sensors that are classified that the government doesn’t want adversaries to be aware of.Rath:How much has your project, the Galileo Project, been involved with the Pentagon office? Have you been sharing a lot of data?Loeb:Well, the past couple of years were very interesting. After my book “Extraterrestrial” came out, a lot of high-level people came to my home. They included multibillionaires that funded the Galileo Project. They were inspired by the vision and the fact that there was no scientific search for technological devices near Earth from an extraterrestrial civilization, and also the fact that the first three out of four interstellar objects that were discovered over the past decade appear to be weird, unusual outliers relative to the rocks that we found from the solar system before the asteroids or the comets just over the past decade. We could find those objects that entered the solar system from outside with no survey telescopes, with no satellites the government employs.The first two were meteors roughly the size of a meter that collided with the Earth and burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere. We realized that both of them arrived from outside the solar system. They were moving very fast. So we discovered the first two interstellar meteors.Then, about seven months after the second one, there was the object, Oumuamua, which was discovered by a telescope in Hawaii. That object was much bigger, the size of a football field — about 200 times bigger than those meteors. It also looked weird because it had an extreme shape, most likely flat, and it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force without showing any cometary evaporation. There was no comet around it. I suggested it [the force] was the reflection of sunlight, and for that, the object had to be very thin, unlike the asteroids or comets we had seen before.And actually, three years later, the same telescope in Hawaii discovered another object with no cometary tail, and it ended up being a rocket booster that NASA launched in 1966. It had thin walls and was made of stainless steel, so clearly, it was artificial in origin; that’s why it didn’t evaporate, and we know it because we produced it.The question is: who produced Oumuamua, or the meteors? And I should say the meteors are also unusual in the sense that they are made of material that has a strength that is at least ten times bigger than all other space rocks in NASA’s catalog of meteors over the past decade. But it’s also possible that there are spacecrafts made of some artificial alloy, like stainless steel.We’re going to find out. We’ve planned an expedition to the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2023, and we will look for the fragments of the first interstellar meteor and try to figure out what it was made of.Rath:So if you recover this object deep in the Pacific, will that be the first interstellar object that we’ve recovered?Loeb:Yeah. It would be the first time that humans put their hands on the material that makes an object the size of a person from outside the solar system. So no matter what, it will be exciting. Since we expect its material strength to be quite unusual, we will learn something new, irrespective of whether it’s natural or artificial in origin. That’s why I find it exciting, and I’m willing to sleep on the deck next to the machine room for a couple of weeks this summer."

""These new forms of medical debt can create financial ruin for individuals who get sick.""Nationwide, about 100 million people — including 41% of adults — have some kind of health care debt, KFF Health News found in an investigation conducted with NPR to explore the scale and impact of the nation's medical debt crisis.The vast scope of the problem is feeding a multibillion-dollar patient financing business, with private equity and big banks looking to cash in when patients and their families can't pay for care, KFF Health News and NPR found. In the patient financing industry, profit margins top 29%, according to research firm IBISWorld, or seven times what is considered a solid hospital profit margin.Millions of patients sign up for credit cards, such as CareCredit offered by Synchrony Bank. These cards are often marketed in the waiting rooms of physicians' and dentists' offices to help people with their bills.The cards typically offer a promotional period during which patients pay no interest, but if patients miss a payment or can't pay off the loan during the promotional period, they can face interest rates that reach as high as 27%, according to the CFPB.Patients are also increasingly being routed by hospitals and other providers into loans administered by financing companies such as AccessOne. These loans, which often replace no-interest installment plans that hospitals once commonly offered, can add hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest to the debts patients owe.A KFF Health News analysis of public records from UNC Health, North Carolina's public university medical system, found that after AccessOne began administering payment plans for the system's patients, the share paying interest on their bills jumped from 9% to 46%.Hospital and finance industry officials insist they take care to educate patients about the risks of taking out loans with interest rates.But federal regulators have found that many patients remain confused about the terms of the loans. In 2013, the CFPB ordered CareCredit to create a $34.1 million reimbursement fund for consumers the agency said had been victims of ""deceptive credit card enrollment tactics.""The new CFPB report does not recommend new sanctions against lenders. Regulators cautioned, however, that the system still traps many patients in damaging financing arrangements. ""Patients appear not to fully understand the terms of the products and sometimes end up with credit they are unable to afford,"" the agency said.The risks are particularly high for lower-income borrowers and those with poor credit.Regulators found, for example, that about a quarter of people with a low credit score who signed up for a deferred-interest medical loan were unable to pay it off before interest rates jumped. By contrast, just 10% of borrowers with excellent credit failed to avoid the high interest rates.The CFPB warned that the growth of patient financing products poses yet another risk to low-income patients, saying they should be offered financial assistance with large medical bills but instead are being routed into credit cards or loans that pile interest on top of medical bills they can't afford.""Consumer complaints to the CFPB suggest that, rather than benefiting consumers, as claimed by the companies offering these products, these products in fact may cause confusion and hardship,"" the report concluded. ""Many people would be better off without these products.""KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

For Harvard women’s basketball this year, it may have started on the Charles River.Last fall, after a pre-season practice had wrapped up, first-year head coach Carrie Moore took her team out with Harvard women’s lightweight rowing team to get a taste of  navigating as a team on the water. Unfortunately, the conditions weren’t the best.“It was, like, freezing and raining and we had just had practice and [Moore was] like, ‘All right, let’s go, let’s go to the river!’” said senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy, who had never been rowing before.Moore — who herself had also never rowed before — admits that she was scared. But the rowers, who were sprinkled among the basketball players in the boats, assured them that the odds of tipping over were low. After that, the reason for the trip started to come through.“I think you learn a lot on the boat,” Moore said. “Just in terms of it’s not an individual sport by any means. If one person is off at all in terms of their technique, the boat is shifting left or right. The balance has to be perfect.”It’s not the typical exercise for a basketball program that for 40 seasons was led by Kathy Delaney-Smith, after whom the head coaching position at Harvard is named. But in her first year as skipper, Moore has steered the Crimson’s ship to the Ivy League tournament with a 16-10 record in her first year, two wins away from an automatic berth in the NCAA tourney. For Moore, it’s all part of the plan as she aims to keep Harvard on the course Delaney-Smith set — and even go beyond.Big shoes to fillIt would be natural for just about anyone to be intimidated when trying to fill the big shoes of Delaney-Smith. Over her four decades at Harvard, she racked up 630 wins, winning nearly 70% of her games in the Ivy League along the way.But for Moore, who came to Harvard from the University of Michigan, that torch wasn’t a burden.“I don’t know if I necessarily have ever felt it as pressure,” Moore said. “I think, if anything, I just see it as a tremendous opportunity. Because she proved that you can win at a very high level here. Which means that it’s possible for us to do what we want to do.”For players like senior guard and captain McKenzie Forbes, one of the things that helped with the transition is that Moore made a lasting first impression.“I feel like the person we got that day is like the same Coach Moore that we have to this day, and I think everyone can appreciate that,” Forbes said. “And like feel that when you’re meeting someone new, you can kind of like get that vibe of like, ‘OK, what kind of person are they?’ And I think she’s very authentic, very genuine with us.”Authenticity on and off the courtOn the court, the seeds of that authenticity are on full display. During the regular season finale against Dartmouth at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion, Moore roamed the sidelines, her hands in her pockets, picking up every little detail and pulling players to the side for quick conversations the moment they stepped off the court.Even though the Big Green hadn’t won an Ivy League game all year, Moore coached with the focus you'd expect of someone in the Final Four. Harvard would go on to win in a 64-40 route.It’s the kind of attention to detail that Harvard will need as it heads into the Ivy League Tournament. But Moore’s core mantra of “Believe It” has the team feeling like they can run the table even as they face Columbia, the only Ivy League team Harvard hasn’t beaten this year.“This whole season, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and changing of the lineups with different injuries, different players being out. But she’s always like, ‘Believe It,’” McCarthy said with a snap of her finger.“All we have is all we need,” Forbes added.Over the course of the season, Moore’s learned a lot. One of the main lessons she’s come to understand is just how much patience the profession requires. She wants to hang banners and doesn’t want to settle for being third or fourth in the conference. She wants to recruit players who can change the trajectory of the program, and she hopes to make them into better people and players.Moore knows that’s coming. But if basketball is anything like rowing down a river, then even the best coaches have to get used to the water first.“I’m a Taurus and I’m extremely stubborn. And it’s incredibly hard for me to not have it all right now,” Moore said. “But I think I’ve learned that the lessons and the enjoyment is in the journey, not necessarily the destination. But we’ll get there.”"

Should legislation advance in the State House, Massachusetts would join the 10 states and Washington, D.C. that have already legalized physician-assisted death.One of those states is California, where the legislation passed and was signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016. Health reporter April Dembosky of California’s KQED station covering the Bay Area joined GBH’sAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath to discuss the rollout of physician-assisted death in California. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath:There are a few different terms and euphemisms for the process: medical aid in dying, physician-assisted suicide, the right to die, to name a few. You’ve written about these euphemisms. What is the evolution of it? Is it all about just moving away from the term ""suicide""?April Dembosky:It’s interesting. I covered the debates around this bill throughout the time that it was moving through the Legislature. And throughout that time, I was actually lobbied by people on both sides about what terms to use. At the time, in California, we started out referring to the practice as assisted suicide because that was the term that people knew and because this was the style that was recommended by the Associated Press.But during that time, proponents really argued that that term was not accurate. They said, you know, suicide refers to someone who wants to die, whereas people who were seeking this kind of care wanted to live but were already dying, and the process was about hastening their death, not causing it.At the same time, the terms that proponents were using tended to be jargony or, as you said, euphemistic. They were difficult to grasp. You know, especially back then — aid in dying, death with dignity — people didn't really understand exactly what those terms meant. What we ended up doing was we ended up trying to avoid using either side's preferred language. We would just try to put the law in context and say, this is a law that allows terminally ill people to take lethal medication to hasten their death.I will say once the bill became law here, we did become a little bit more sympathetic to the proponents and started to veer away from using terms like assisted suicide, although I do believe that is still the official term used by the AP.Rath:Tell us about how the process has worked as it’s been rolled out over the last several years.Dembosky:The first thing to say is that since this became law, not a lot of people have actually taken advantage of it. In the last three years, our state data shows that less than 500 people a year will take these lethal medications to end their lives.Rath:For a state the size of California, that’s not a lot of people.Dembosky:It is .001% of the number of people who die in California every year. So it’s a very, very small number. Part of this is because a lot of people aren’t interested, or a lot of people don’t know about it. But especially in the earlier years, there was also an issue with being able to find a doctor who was willing and trained to provide this kind of service. So even people who didn't know about it and wanted to take advantage of it couldn't necessarily find someone to help them.Our law in California was quite clear that this is optional, that no doctor has to do it if they have objections to it. So, for example, all of the Catholic systems in our state actually forbid their doctors from participating. But other large health care systems, like Kaiser Permanente and Sutter, started programs where they started to reach out to physicians to find out who was interested. And then they started to do training and education so that they would understand all the protocols and science around the medication.We also had a nonprofit group that began a centralized referral system. It's called the American Clinicians Academy on Medical Aid in Dying. Patients can go to this website, fill out an intake form, and if they qualify, they'll be matched with a doctor near them who's willing to provide the service.Rath:So overall, on the patient’s side, for people who do want to pursue that option, how difficult is it to go through legally?Dembosky:It's interesting that you phrase it as difficult, because I think some of the early adopters, if you will, who did try to take advantage of this law made complaints that it was too difficult. I think if you were to ask some of the opponents of the bill, that was, by design, there was really fierce debate around this bill.Most of the opposition came from disability rights advocates who feared that there would be coercion, that people who were living with disabilities might be pressured by their family members or even by doctors to give up on life-saving care that was perhaps expensive and choose this option to end their lives.The people who were pushing the bill really listened to these concerns and worked a lot of safeguards into the bill. For example, two doctors have to verify that the person has a terminal illness and has six months or less to live. The patient has to request the medication three times before they can get it, and one of those times has to be in writing. And then there's also a waiting period of 15 days between the first two requests.One of the early studies that was done around the practice actually found that close to a quarter of the people who wanted this medication were actually dying during that 15-day waiting period and were unable to have the deaths that they had hoped for.Rath:Obviously, this being applied disproportionately to the disabled or to the elderly or to people who might be poorer or other kinds of disadvantaged communities is kind of a nightmare scenario that people who are opposed to these laws tended to lay out. How much are those other fears coming into play?Dembosky:The data we have from California shows that these fears or assertions are not actually being borne out.I would say from a demographic perspective, physician-assisted death or aid in dying has been largely a white enterprise. To date, 87% of people who have taken these medications in California are white.Overwhelmingly, they are highly educated, having at least some college education, if not a college or a graduate degree.The vast majority of people who take the medication take it for a terminal illness like cancer, so 70% of people who have taken it have some kind of cancer. After that, it's 11% that have a neurological disease like ALS or Parkinson's. And then after that, it's heart disease or respiratory disease.We're also not seeing some of the fears around people with disabilities. So we don't know what percentage of people who have taken the drug have a non-terminal disability. But what we do know is that if they took the drug, it's most likely because they also had a terminal illness, most likely cancer.Rath:I’m wondering if, on the other side, if those disparities reflect, say, people of color or people who are economically disadvantaged are not getting as much access to these services or maybe other aspects about why they’re not opting in?Dembosky:The proponents of this practice would certainly argue that that is the case. They would say there hasn’t been enough outreach to let people know that this is available."

This week marks one year since the company announced its Live and Work Anywhere policy, and now, it's time to gloat.""The business has actually never performed better since we moved to this program,"" says Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson. ""It's working really well for us.""Other companies, including tech ones, are taking a very different path.The Pew Research Center found that among people whose jobs can be done remotely, just over a third are still working from home all the time, down from 43% a year ago.At Airbnb, all but a very few employees have a choice: They can work from home (anywhere in the country where they're based), or they can go into an Airbnb office (there are 26 of them around the world).Regardless of where they live, they keep their same salary.And they aren't bound by geography, with the company allowing them to work in over 170 other countries for up to 90 days per year per country. Airbnb is talking to governments abroad about making it easier for all people to work around the world.Talent doesn't want to be tied downThere is an obvious business interest here. People who can jet off somewhere with their laptops are potential Airbnb guests and hosts.Freeing people from the office has also provided savings for the company, whose office footprint is now less than half of what it was before the pandemic.Still, Stephenson insists that Live and Work Anywhere is really about winning the global war for talent.""The best talent in the world is not all within a 50-mile radius of San Francisco,"" he says.And that talent, Stephenson says, no longer wants to be tied down.Before the pandemic, 95% of Airbnb employees lived near a company office. Now, almost a quarter of employees are more than 50 miles from an office, beyond a comfortable commute.A migration out of San FranciscoSteve Stecher has gone even farther than an hour's drive.Stecher moved his family out of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco during the pandemic, and since last fall they have spent most of their time in Buenos Aires.That has dramatically changed their financial picture, says Stecher, a senior manager of quality assurance at Airbnb.""Don't repeat this to my boss, but I think it's about 30%, or maybe 40% maximum, of the cost of living in the Bay Area,"" he says.Stecher manages a team of about 140 people, many of whom have also moved out of California, but primarily to the Midwest and East Coast where they have family, he says.""We did used to have a lot of fun in person,"" Stecher says about one of the tradeoffs in his new life.Airbnb now flies teams in for regular in-person gatherings, which the company sees as critical to success.""We are not remote first. We are just being intentional about how we gather,"" says Stephenson. ""It's not a random three days a week where you hope to run into people at a water cooler.""Deploying a team called Ground Control, Airbnb works to ensure that the right people are in the right place at the right time for these large gatherings.""We're still learning the right rhythms for when people are getting together,"" Stephenson says. ""I think that's the biggest challenge that we have.""Catering to different needs, and a healthy bottom lineAirbnb added 900,000 hosts last year, reaching a total of 6.6 million worldwide. Revenue growth has been strong. Stephenson sees these as signs the company is moving in the right direction.Moreover, employees are happy. Airbnb's attrition rate is close to an all-time low and falling, the company says.And Airbnb's goal of hiring more women and under-represented minorities has gotten a boost from the new policy.""Now that we're in a live anywhere context, it really gives us an opportunity to cater to different needs,"" says Benny Etienne, a leader of Black@, the company's affinity group for Black employees. ""Within a diverse group, we all have very diverse identities and diverse realities.""So far, only about 20% of Airbnb employees have taken advantage of Live and Work Anywhere to relocate domestically or travel abroad.Etienne, who works for Ground Control out of Airbnb's Montreal office, is encouraging anyone who can take their work somewhere else to try it, at least for a week.""The change of scenery has a huge impact on your mental health,"" she says on a call from Mérida, Mexico, where she's spent most of the winter and spring.Further south, the savings that Stecher and his family have enjoyed since leaving San Francisco have allowed his wife Ana Ruiz, who worked in banking, to stay home with their children in Buenos Aires and also to travel, something the family is passionate about.""We were just in our own little world in the U.S.,"" says Ruiz, who grew up in Mexico.

With this increased funding, the program now plans to support about 400 students over the next five years in order to address inequities and further diversify the nursing workforce.Gaurdia Bannister, executive director of the Institute for Patient Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said nurses are in a unique position to improve patients' health outcomes because they spend more time with patients than other clinical staff. And she says being a nurse of color or bringing a particular cultural competence can “really help move the dial” onlong-standingandworseninghealth inequities in Massachusetts.“And I can tell you, these students are extraordinary,” Bannister said. “They are so passionate about wanting to become nurses and have overcome challenges. ... Sometimes these students may be a little bit older, so they have families that they need to take care of. Some of them are immigrants. They're committed, though, to staying.”Lindsey Desameau, who graduated from UMass Boston’s nursing school in May and will soon be working at Brigham Women’s Hospital, received three semesters of tuition assistance and stipends amounting to around $17,000. She was also assigned an experienced nurse mentor who, like her, is Haitian American. She recognizes how her background can help patients.“I've even had doctors come up to me and knowing that I speak Haitian Creole say ‘Can you come in and translate for us and kind of have that small talk with the patient?’ And it's been a tremendous change for that patient,” said Desameau.UMass Boston Chancellor Marcelo Suárez-Orozco told GBH News the increased funding for the program, to support more students like Desameau, will be transformational.“Nursing is the vertebrae of our healthcare system,” he said. “So we need to address nursing shortages. We need to improve patient care. Nurses are at the forefront of cost effectiveness, health promotion, prevention and really adapting to the evolving needs of the patient population.”Katie Murphy, the president of the Massachusetts Nursing Association, said she is concerned aboutnursing shortages in the state, but believes that working conditions, including staff-to-patient ratios that her union feels are too low, have caused nurses to leave Massachusetts after graduating.“From our point of view, I mean, if you look at the numbers on the Board of Registration’s nursing website, we have more nurses today than we did before the pandemic,” Murphy said. “We’re graduating nurses all over the state, a couple of thousand every year. So we don't have a nursing shortage. We really don't. But we have nurses that are not willing to work under these circumstances.”Murphy also agreed increased diversity is important for both patients and providers, but that ""we have a long way to go."" Out of the Massachusetts Nursing Association's more than 22,000 members, a recent internal survey showed about 90% are white, compared to just around 70% in the state population on the whole.Murphy said one factor in that discrepancy may be the cost and time it takes to obtain a nursing degree. There are some associate degrees, but she said a bachelor's degree is effectively required for nurses who want to find work in higher-paying hospitals.“Getting a nursing degree is expensive; and I think that that kind of reflects the systemic racism in our society as a whole.” said Murphy. “Who has the wherewithal, who's got that generational wealth to pay?”UMass Boston’s nursing school said of its approximately 1,800 current students, 20% are Black, 14% Latinx, and 13% Asian — which is close to the racial and ethnic makeup of Boston. Mass General Brigham couldn’t share demographic data on its nursing staff, but did say that 34% of its almost 86,000 total employees are non-white, with around 11% of them being Asian, 11% Black and about 10% being Hispanic.Suárez-Orozco said the investment in this nursing program and the fact most UMass Boston students stay in the area will further diversify the state's nursing workforce. He said that five years after graduation, more than 80% of all UMass Boston students are still working in Massachusetts.“The number of students from other universities that stay here in Boston is minuscule compared to our demographic,” Suárez-Orozco said. “Our bet here is that the fact that the hospitals are reaching out to us to create this partnership around like-minded approaches to the training of the next generation of nurses will prove an enduring investment in our health care, in our patient population, and the [residents] of Boston and the commonwealth.”"

So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joinedMorning Editionhosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel:So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens?Daniel Medwed:So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain.Paris Alston:Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations?Medwed:Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident.Siegel:Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts.Medwed:Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts.Alston:So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you?Medwed:Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action.Siegel:But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident?Medwed:And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 — It's not a huge fine but you can get fined — if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that.Alston:So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope?Medwed:There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter. Did he consciously disregard the substantial risk of death when he engaged in that type of reckless behavior? So it happens. It's relatively rare, but there are criminal actions that derive from ski accidents occasionally."

The report also found, for the first time ever, that children of color are being diagnosed at a higher rate than white children.To help make sense of what the new data mean, autism researcher Dr. Sarabeth Broder-Fingert spoke with GBH'sAll Things Consideredhost Arun Rath. Broder-Fingert is a professor of pediatrics and associate director of research at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath:Before we dive into the details of this new data, help us understand a bit more about what an autism diagnosis means for a child and their family.Sarabeth Broder-Fingert:Well, an autism diagnosis can actually mean a range of things because it's such a spectrum. In general, children will undergo relatively extensive testing to determine if they meet criteria for autism. Once obtaining a diagnosis, that's the gateway into getting a variety of treatment services that children need. Those can range from daily support for social communication, many children will also need additional support, things like occupational therapy and physical therapy. There are very high rates of other comorbid conditions, particularly mental health disorders, so it may also mean additional support for mental health concerns — along with the supports for core symptoms of autism.Rath:When you're looking at new data like this, how do you tell whether autism rates are rising versus, maybe, the testing is revealing more than it did in the past?Broder-Fingert:Yeah, this is a common point of conversation. I think that the rates are likely both rising, and we're doing a better job at detecting autism. I think it's probably both things together, although it is a little hard to pull apart because it's certainly possible that a lot of this relates to our ability to understand and detect autism more accurately and more fully than in years past, which allows us to find kids who are out there who had been missed previously. I think, and many people believe, that probably the larger contributor here is that we're doing a better job of actually finding these kids and being able to get them a diagnosis. With that said, it's undeniable that the rapid increase in prevalence is likely multifactorial.Rath:With what looks like a dramatic increase over just five years, do we have a sense of why autism rates are rising in that way?Broder-Fingert:Well, I think first, for sure, one reason is just that we're getting better at finding it. I think that the new data on race and ethnicity is a great example of that. Many of us in the field have been working for years, really focused on these dramatic disparities that exist in diagnosis.In the original CDC data that that came out almost 20 years ago now, there were profound differences by race and ethnicity in the prevalence numbers. We've been working hard to close that gap. Most people believe that that gap is only related, really, to society's ability to help diagnose and support those families and those kids have just been getting missed. In some ways, the new data is showing that both the prevalence and those numbers by race ethnicity have have dramatically changed are really a reflection of a lot of, I think, successes that we've had in the community trying to improve diagnostic services and address health disparities.With that said, I do think that although there's things to celebrate about the fact that we're doing a better job diagnosing children of color particularly, I think this is the the first step in a long list of things that need to be accomplished. I think we have achieved some better equity in diagnosis but these data don't reflect how many of these kids are actually getting into treatment.I do worry greatly that although we've decreased the disparities in actual diagnostic numbers, we haven't decreased the disparities in which of these kids are actually getting evidence-based treatment and all the support that they need. So, I think we still have a long way to go, but I do think that that these numbers should give us some hope that we are doing a better job at finding kids and getting them a diagnosis.Rath:That's fascinating. So, it used to be that the gap was that more white children were diagnosed with autism? And it's been a correction?Broder-Fingert:That's exactly right. There used to be really large differences by race and ethnicity. The challenge has been that, as a society, we were just not diagnosing Black children or children of color at the rate that we were diagnosing white children — for reasons such as bias within the health care system, structural racism and the tools that we use not being sensitive to different racial and ethnic backgrounds. I think there's been a huge effort across the country to try to close some of those gaps and I think that's that's what's happened here.Rath:That's fascinating, because it also seems like it would enforce a stereotype of autism somehow being a disease of affluence.Broder-Fingert:Exactly, and I do think that was a stereotype for a long time and has been a huge problem. There have been a number of us who have been working really hard to change that perception. I do think that we're having some impact, although we have a long way to go. For many years, it was believed that autism was a condition that was only in affluent or white populations.Rath:So, if there's been this lag with children of color not getting diagnosed and there's been this catching up on that, it would seem like there would also have to be a lag in treatment, right? And getting these children of color treatment at the same rate?Broder-Fingert:I think anyone who works in the community and anyone who looks at the data would know that, although we're now catching up on diagnostics, we still have a ways to go on treatment. Children of color still have a harder time getting all the different evidence-based treatments. As I mentioned before, autistic children will often need multiple treatments from different providers, from different service settings — whether it's the school and the health system or community resources.We know that, although we've made this gain in diagnosing children of color, we have not yet caught up in getting them into treatment. I think for those who are focused on equity and disparities, that is going to be a next really important step to focus on: really getting these kids into treatment and and supporting their families so that, once they're diagnosed, they have all the services they need. We're certainly not close there. But with that said, 15 years ago, I would have been very surprised that we have now made such an impact on diagnostic disparities. So I would say there's hope that, with the focus on treatment, that we can achieve a similar outcome that has been achieved here.Rath:Dr. Broder-Fingert, it is really eye-opening and helpful to be able to break down this data from the headlines in this way. You've done a brilliant job of it. Thank you so much.Broder-Fingert:Oh, my pleasure."

But protecting writers from the negative impacts of these technologies is not an easy proposition.According to a forthcoming report from The Authors Guild, the median income for a full-time writer last year was $23,000. And writers' incomes declined by 42% between 2009 and 2019.The advent of text-based generative AI applications like GPT-4 and Bard, that scrape the Web for authors' content without permission or compensation and then use it to produce new content in response to users' prompts, is giving writers across the country even more cause for worry.""There's no urgent need for AI to write a novel,"" said Alexander Chee, the bestselling author of novels like Edinburgh and The Queen of the Night. ""The only people who might need that are the people who object to paying writers what they're worth.""Chee is among the nearly 8,000 authors who just signed a letter addressed to the leaders of six AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta.""It says it's not fair to use our stuff in your AI without permission or payment,"" said Mary Rasenberger, CEO of The Author's Guild. The non-profit writers' advocacy organization created the letter, and sent it out to the AI companies on Monday. ""So please start compensating us and talking to us.""Rasenberger said the guild is trying to get these companies to settle without suing them.""Lawsuits are a tremendous amount of money,"" Rasenberger said. ""They take a really long time.""But some literary figures are willing to fight the tech companies in court.Authors including Sarah Silverman, Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad recently signed on as plaintiffs in class action lawsuits alleging Meta and/or OpenAI trained their AI programs on pirated copies of their works. The plaintiffs' lawyers, Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick, couldn't be reached in time for NPR's deadline and the AI companies turned down requests for comment.Gina Maccoby is a literary agent in New York. She says the legal actions are a necessary step towards getting writers a fair shake.""It has to happen,"" Maccoby said. ""That's the only way these things are settled.""Maccoby said agents, including herself, are starting to talk to publishers about featuring language in writers' contracts that prohibits unauthorized uses of AI as another way to protect their livelihoods, and those of their clients. (According to a recent Authors Guild survey about AI, while 90% of the writers who responded said that ""they should be compensated for the use of their work in training AI,"" 67% said they ""were not sure whether their publishing contracts or platform terms of service include permissions or grant of rights to use their work for any AI-related purposes."")""What I hear from colleagues is that most publishers are amenable to restricting certain kinds of AI use,"" Maccoby said, adding that she has yet to add such clauses to her own writers' contracts. The Authors Guild updated its model contract in March to include language addressing the use of AI.The major publishers NPR contacted for this story declined to comment.Maccoby said even if authors' contracts explicitly forbid AI companies from scraping and profiting from literary works, the rules are hard to enforce.""How does one even know if a book is in a data set that was ingested by an AI program?"" Maccoby said.In addition to letters, lawsuits and contractual language, the publishing sector is further looking to safeguard authors' futures by advocating for legislation around how generative AI can and cannot be used.The Author's Guild's Rasenberger said her organization is actively lobbying for such bills. Meanwhile, many hearings have been held at various levels of government on AI-related topics lately, such as last week's senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on AI and copyright.""Right now there's a lot of talking about it,"" said Rumman Chowdhury, a Responsible AI Fellow at Harvard University, who gave testimony at one such hearing in June. ""But we're not seeing yet any concrete legislation or regulation coming out.""Chowdhury said the way forward is bound to be messy.""Some of it will be litigated, some of it will be regulated, and some of it people will literally just have to shout until we're heard,"" she said. ""So right now, the best we can do is ask the AI companies 'pretty, pretty please,' and hopefully somebody will respond.""Audio and digital stories edited by Meghan Collins Sullivan.

So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.""Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil.“What we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,” Vilar said.Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury.“In order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,” he said.Most produce won’t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said.“Typically when you start to put things into the ground and it’s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,” he said. “There are things that you can start early on — like peas — that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.”Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said.The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens.Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant — but not quite yet.Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners ofPemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont,said now’s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go.“We’re itching to get outside,” he said. “We are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale — all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost — so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.”Though most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold.“I appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,” he said. “This will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.”Most local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs — tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few — that will be ready to go into the ground.“Pansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,” Saidnawey said. “They'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.”Perennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: “Hellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.”Trees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it’s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.“By the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,” he said.It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens.“If you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,” Saidnawey said. “So it’s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.”People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said.Leftover containers from last season are still just fine, Saidnawey said. They may need some fresh soil, a bit of compost and new plants.“One of the greatest joys is to watch people walk into this place with a smile on their face,” Saidnawey said. “I mean, if you're walking into a plant store without a smile on your face, something's wrong.”"

That risk only grows, they say, as climate change makes severe storms more common.“A lot of these dams are really old,” said Cathy Bozek of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “A lot of them were built to power old mills [and] factories, and they’re not being used anymore. They’re obsolete dams, and many of these dams are not being maintained. They are in unsafe condition and are subject to failing during heavy storms.”Of the roughly 3,000 dams in Massachusetts, about 1,300 are large enough to be listed in theNational Inventory of Damskept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Of those, 328 are ranked as having “high hazard potential.”“Which means that loss of life and significant damage to homes, buildings, infrastructure is likely if the dam fails,” Bozek said. ""An additional 643 are 'significant hazard' rated. And that means that there may not be loss of life, but it can cause significant economic loss, environmental damage and disruption of lifeline facilities.""In Vermont’s capital, Montpelier, officials said early Tuesday morning that the nearby high-hazard Wrightsville Damwas close to capacity. Overflowing had “never happened since the dam was built so there is no precedent for potential damage,” City Manager William Fraser warned. The water level ultimately subsided, but the city was still left withextensive destruction:many businesses and Montpelier’s City Hall are closed while they recover, and one man died.In Massachusetts, Bozek recalled the near-failure of the Whittington Dam in Taunton in 2005 during a strong storm. Thousands of people were told toevacuate the city’s downtown, which sits about a half-mile downstream from the dam.""They had to declare a state of emergency,"" Bozek said. ""That one ended up having emergency repairs and they were able to save the dam and there was no loss of life. But it was a huge risk, and Massachusetts certainly is in danger of seeing significant flooding and infrastructure damage from dam failures in the future.""Standing by the Watertown Dam in Watertown on Wednesday, Robert Kearns of the Charles River Watershed Association pointed to rushing water and recalled a spring Nor’easter in 2010 that brought days of rain to the area.“Back in the 2010 storm, the water on the opposite side of the river came over the earthen embankment and really went over and around the dam,” he said. “A lot of these structures are just either totally left forgotten or are really not designed for the strongest storms, the more increased rainfall that we're seeing here in the Northeast with climate change.”The Watertown Dam is owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Kearns said, and the Charles River Watershed Association is pushing for the department to remove it.“We’re really hoping that they'll make the right decision,” he said.DCR did not make anyone available for an interview, but a spokesperson sent a statement regarding the recent storm.“Dams overflow for a number of reasons, including weather conditions and a blockage of water flow. However, a dam overflow is not the same as a dam failure,” the spokesperson said in the written statement. “So far, there have not been any dam failures or emergency conditions reported to the Office of Dam Safety following the recent weather conditions. We will continue to monitor dams across the state and will respond to any reports of emergencies or failures.”Several dam removals are underway in Massachusetts, including a current project at the High Street Dam in Bridgewater, Bozek said. One barrier to removal — the high cost associated with carefully taking down a dam — eased after billions of dollars were made availableunder the 2021 federal infrastructure bill.“Through the bipartisan infrastructure bill and other funding opportunities, we’re bringing a lot of support for these projects, and we’re able to move a lot of them forward,” Bozek said. “And so, we’re seeing great progress in working with the dam owners, working with communities and really bringing a lot of these projects into implementation.”In the case of a dam overflowing or failing in Massachusetts, Kearns said there's not enough publicly available information about what the likely impact would be.“Here in Massachusetts, there's not a database online where the public and first responders can go and look at if a dam were to fail ... where would that water go?” Kearns said. “That information is in the emergency action plan that some first responders have, but it's not as publicly available as in other states like California, where ... you can look up every dam that's a significant or high hazard dam and see, if that were to fail, where that water would go.”FEMA’s flood maps for the commonwealth are also outdated, he said.“A lot of the areas that have flooded in Vermont are not in the FEMA flood zones,” Kearns said. “So, FEMA flood zones are based on past data ... past floods. But we’re seeing floods today that we haven't seen in the past.”Some cities, like Boston, have updated flood maps that project into a future impacted by climate change.“But really, the state really needs to do this across the whole commonwealth because people are going to be vulnerable,” Kearns said.Making that kind of information more widely available, piece by piece, is one of the ways the Charles River Watershed Association is trying to address the problem.They worked with 20 cities and towns along the Charles River to create asimulationof flooding along the Charles, using climate projections for 2030 and 2070.“With our regional outlook, we’re better able to understand inland flooding impacts and determine the most effective solutions,” said the Rev. Vernon K. Walker, program director of Climate CREW (Communities Responding to Extreme Weather), which is helping CRWA with community engagement on the project.Using those projections, the project is helping those municipalities make changes now to prevent flooding in the future.“We’re looking at building green storm water infrastructure,” Walker said. “We’re looking at reducing impervious cover. We’re looking at land conservation and increasing the tree canopy. And all these are potential opportunities for flood water storage.”And for when those floods eventually do hit, Climate CREW is prepared to give community members “to-go” emergency bags with items like flashlights, can openers and waterproof matches.Correction: This story was updated to clarify the roles of the Charles River Watershed Association and Climate CREW in the flooding simulation project and outreach."

They've also shown how it can be extinguished.The finding involves Huntington's disease, a rare, inherited brain disorder that cut short the life of songwriter Woody Guthrie. But the study has implications for other degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's.It ""opens the path"" to finding the initial event that leads to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, says Corinne Lasmézas, who studies neurodegenerative diseases at the Wertheim UF Scripps Institute in Jupiter, Florida. She was not involved in the study.People with Huntington's ""begin to lose control of their body movements, they have mental impediments over time, and eventually they die,"" says Randal Halfmann, an author of the study and a researcher at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo.Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington's occurs when proteins in the brain fold into an abnormal shape and begin to stick together. Then these clumps of abnormal protein begin to cause nearby proteins to misfold and clump too.""As the disease progresses you're effectively watching a sort of a forest fire,"" Halfmann says. ""And you're trying to figure out what started it.""In essence, Halfmann's team wanted to find the molecular matchstick responsible for the lethal blaze.Looking inside a cellTo do that, they needed to chronicle an event that is fleeting and usually invisible. It's called nucleation, the moment when a misfolded protein begins to aggregate and proliferate.The team developed a way to conduct experiments inside individual cells. They used genetic tweaks to create hundreds of versions of a protein segment called PolyQ, which becomes toxic in Huntington's.The team placed different versions of PolyQ in a cell, then look for signs of misfolding and clumping.""It's sort of like if you're in a dark room and you're trying to figure out what the shape of the room is,"" Halfmann says. ""You just keep bumping into things and eventually you bump into things enough times to figure out exactly what it looks like.""The trial-and-error approach worked, Halfmann says. ""What starts this little forest fire in the brain is a single molecule of PolyQ.""Once the team had identified that molecule, they were able to find a way to prevent it from spreading — at least in the lab. The trick was to flood the cell with proteins that, in effect, smothered the flame before it could do any damage.The next step will be to develop a drug that can do something similar in people, Halfmann says.""Ultimately, it only matters if we actually create a therapy,"" he says. ""Otherwise, it's just academics.""The study could also lead to new treatments for other neurodegenerative diseases, Lasmézas says, treatments that prevent the cascade of events that leads to brain damage.""You have to go back when the fire starts, so that it doesn't propagate in the entire forest,"" she says.Lessons for Alzheimer's research?The Alzheimer's field appears to be learning that lesson.Early drugs targeted the large amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with the disease. But these drugs didn't work, perhaps because the plaques they sought to eliminate are just the charred remains of a forest that has already burned.Lasmézas says the latest drugs, like lecanemab, still remove large clumps of amyloid, ""but they also recognize the ones that are smaller and that are more toxic. And this is why they block more efficiently, the neuronal toxicity.""These smaller clumps form before plaques appear, and are closer to the event that touches off Alzheimer's in the first place, Lasmézas says.Studies like the one on Huntington's show that scientists are finally closing in on strategies that will slow or halt diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, Lasmézas says.""For a long time, we didn't know much about the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases,"" she says.

There's an endless stream of conversations about blue checkmarks on Twitter. And last week, New York's public transit system, the MTA, announced it would no longer be using Twitter for service alerts and information. GBH's Social Media Strategist Zack Waldman joined GBH’sMorning Editionco-host Paris Alston to talk about what’s happening in the social media zeitgeist. This transcript has been lightly edited.Paris Alston:So, Zack, where does Twitter stand on blue checkmarks right now?Zack Waldman:With the blue checkmark, that's an indication of, in theory, whether or not you have signed up for the new Twitter Blue subscription verification program. Twitter Blue costs $8 per month for individuals, and it goes for actually $1,000 per month for organizations. Checkmarks previously were always a symbol of authenticity and credibility. In the last six to 12 months, that is now certainly up for debate and in question.Alston:Because anybody can buy one.Waldman:Anybody can buy one. All it takes is this subscription fee per month to get that checkmark next to your account name on Twitter. There is certainly not as much trust in the checkmark. It has lost really significant luster.Alston:Jeremy and I were both sad to lose ours. He was probably even more sad because he loves Twitter. But I mentioned the MTA, and our very own transit authority here, the MBTA, has told GBH News that it applied for free verified organization status and an associated gray checkmark from Twitter and that it has no plans to subscribe to Twitter Blue or to pay for verification status. Now, it is important to note that both of those organizations are still on Twitter. GBH is too, and we know that our mothership, NPR has left. What goes into an organization's decision to stay or to leave or to treat Twitter differently?Waldman:We certainly gave a ton of time, effort, energy and thought into whether or not we wanted to remain active on Twitter. As a foundation, we represent so many differing production units and programs, individuals, at this company, and we made the decision that we felt like our audience was still there and we still owed it to them to be serving them with the content that we produce.And I think it's also worth noting with the MTA specifically, is that decision that they made was very much based on no longer having free access to API, which is kind of the back end of Twitter's platform. One MTA official said that it was going to cost them upwards of $50,000 per month if they wanted to continue to access the API and therefore be able to send out those emergency alerts that are so critical to informing their audience, their commuters of what's going on with the MTA in New York. So paying to be able to continue to tweet at the rate and frequency that they were doing so before, it just didn't make sense literally for them. And it may mean where they're going to have to just beef up their communication levels on other platforms, be it email, newsletter, apps, website, so on and so forth.Alston:Well, speaking of other platforms, let's talk a little bit about TikTok, because I heard that it's being used as a search engine now, for instance.Waldman:It's kind of right there in the mold of a Google in terms of how it's being used by Gen Z-ers who are looking for search results on big time topics, whether it be in the news or pop culture. They actually just created this new feature called Featured Snippets. That's when a user on the platform will type in anything, whether it be bread baking or maybe information on a new legislative bill or more information on something going on in sports with the NHL or NBA playoffs. So now TikTok will give additional written context towards the top results that populate when they put in that search.Alston:So instead of going to Google, you could just go to TikTok.Waldman:It becomes a one-stop shop and you're seeing this across the board with so many social media platforms, where they're trying to make your experience on that platform A to Z, start to finish, where you don't have to go anywhere else for whatever you're looking for.Alston:Well, lastly, Zack, since we are talking about TikTok, what's the latest on the ban that some people have been pushing for?Waldman:It's been a little quiet recently, to be honest with you. The big story was that the current Biden administration was looking to ban TikTok across the board, which is a huge undertaking, a huge endeavor. It remains to be seen what hurdles and what challenges they'll face when it comes to First Amendment rights within the courts. They have also asked, almost demanding in many ways, that ByteDance, which is the Chinese parent company of TikTok, sell to a U.S. company due to security concerns for U.S. users. And there are, I think, around 150 million users of TikTok in the country. It's no small number. So as a strategist, I would say it's very unlikely that TikTok is going to be banned anytime soon.Alston:That is GBH's social media dtrategist Zack Waldman. Thank you so much.Waldman:Thanks, Paris. Appreciate it."

Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, just to name a few. But why is it so important to have women in elected office, and what difference does their leadership make? Amanda Hunter, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, joined GBH’sMorning Editionhosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss. This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel:So what has the center's research shown about the opportunities for women who serve in elected offices and the challenges they face when they get there?Amanda Hunter:Well, one reason that my boss, Barbara Lee, started the foundation — which does nonpartisan research looking at the obstacles and opportunities women face when they seek elected office — is because she knew 25 years ago that having more women's voices at the table, and having more representation at the table in general, was going to strengthen our democracy. And that is exactly what we see both nationally and here in Massachusetts when you look at women's leadership, because women are what we call 360 degree leaders: they bring the entirety of their lived experience to the table. So when you look here in Massachusetts, if you look at our mayor of Boston, for example, Michelle Wu, coming off of the COVID-19 crisis, she had children attending Boston Public Schools. She was a stakeholder when they were trying to figure out the school bus transportation issue. And so she naturally would look at that problem very differently than maybe an older man who did not have children that were directly affected by the bus issue.Paris Alston:And to that point, I'm just thinking about the overturning of Roe v Wade last year. How is policy affected when women are in office, and when they're not at the table making those decisions?Hunter:Well, you're absolutely right, Paris. Our recent study showed that a majority of women voters, including Republicans, did think that the government should stay out of women's reproductive health decisions. That same study showed that women voters think that there should be more women in office, and they believe that women are better equipped to solve the problems that not just voters are facing, but that the country is facing. And we've seen for a number of years that generally voters believe that women are more in touch with ""kitchen table issues"" because regardless of what a woman's family looks like, Barbara always says women are the peacemakers. Women are doing the emotional labor. Women are doing a lot of the shopping. And voters internalize that.Siegel:There are a number of stereotypes and biases, many of them dangerous, that have fueled the outcomes of elections for a long time. Thinking back to the 2016 election and the aftermath of that, many people pointed to the fact that despite her qualifications for the office, Hillary Clinton was not elected in large part due to the fact that she is a woman. I'm curious: From your center, looking at people who are in office, women who are in office, how does society respond to the policies and the leadership that women have when they are elected? Do we sometimes fall into those same stereotypes in response to women who have been elected to office?Hunter:Well, Jeremy, unfortunately, voters still do. And we've found for 25 years in our research that when women run for office, voters don't assume that women are qualified. Women have to do much more. Men can simply release their resumé. Women have to really justify what they accomplished in each job. And so we just recently looked at how voters view incumbent women that are in office. And similarly, voters don't assume that incumbent women are doing a good job. So the burden is on women to overcommunicate their accomplishments when they are in office. And so much of this comes down to stereotypes, as you said. We often talk at the foundation about how a lot of voters still have what we call an ""imagination barrier"" when it comes to picturing women at the highest levels of office. And even though we've broken a lot of barriers here in Massachusetts, sometimes we still see women in leadership held to a different standard because they look different, they sound different, and they are blazing their own trail in the job.Alston:And in addition to those criticisms, I'm also thinking about the challenges they face among their colleagues when they get into office, right? Not only in terms of being undermined or discounted in many ways, but also being harassed. And thinking about our own state auditor, Diana DiZoglio, who says she was sexually harassed as a legislative aide and is opening an investigation into the nondisclosure agreements that currently exist and can keep those things hidden. So with that said, how much further do we still have to go to reach equality for these women in elected office?Hunter:We still have a long way to go. And even though we have a record number of women in elected office at all levels, both nationally at the congressional level and of course here statewide in Massachusetts, women are still largely underrepresented when you compare it to the percentage of men. In our state Legislature, women make up less than a third of the entire State House. And in a progressive state like Massachusetts, that may surprise some people. So in terms of equity, we still have a long way to go. But Auditor DiZoglio is a really great example of a woman who is bringing her lived experience to the job and addressing problems that maybe a man wouldn't think to even begin to address because her experience was so specific. And that's why it's so important to have a diversity of voices at the table.Siegel:What can and should be done to make things more equitable? And what can men who are in office do to better support their counterparts who are women or who are looking to get into office in the first place?Hunter:Well, there are so many things, Jeremy, because we see in our research all the time that voters, for example, scrutinize women's appearance, their voice, their hair, their clothing, in a way that they don't for men, a lot of times because there's a uniform of what men have worn in office for so long and women look differently. So I challenge not just men in elected office, but really all of us: When we hear our friends, our family, our colleagues making comments that sound like they have some gender bias, and racial bias in a lot of cases as well, that we challenge those comments and ask, ""Would you still say that same thing about a man?"" Because oftentimes the answer is no."

The event, hosted by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, launched the group’s ‘Face Jewish Hate’ campaign in collaboration with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism.Robert Kraft, the 81-year-old founder of the foundation and owner of the New England Patriots, told the crowd that the America he sees today reflects Germany in the late 1930s.“We’re seeing neo-Nazis raising swastikas and demonstrating, saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and ‘down with the Jews,’” Kraft said. “This is the United States of America in 2023. There’s no room for that kind of hate — or hate of any kind.”The campaign features afive-point plan: Face Jewish hate, empower the community, build allyship, inform and educate the next generation and strengthen communal security. Those steps were determined by a task force of community leaders and experts on combating antisemitism with antisemitic incidents on the rise.According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were over3,600 reported antisemitic incidentsacross the country in 2022 — the highest number on record since the ADL began tracking the incidents more than 40 years ago. In Massachusetts, antisemitic incidentsjumped 41%from 2021 to 2022.Along with top elected officials like Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Attorney General Andrea Campbell, local Jewish leaders like Kraft addressed the crowd. Speakers stood in front of screens that shared stories of local antisemitic hate crimes, like that ofRabbi Shlomo Noginski, who was stabbed eight times last summer in Brighton outside of a Jewish school. Noginski attended the event but did not address the crowd.Dr. Jeremy Schiller, who, during his tenure as the Chair of the Salem Board of Health during the COVID-19 pandemic, received severalantisemitic messages and threatsfrom people who opposed vaccination and mitigation efforts.He said that, on top of his outrage and indignation, he also felt a growing sense of loneliness and isolation from the lack of attention to antisemitic hate during the pandemic.“If [antisemitism] is not called out, if our communities stay silent, then we enter into that same dangerous debate,” he said. “That’s sending me a yellow star or depicting me with a noose around my neck to my kids, or equating COVID mitigation measures ... to Nuremberg laws.”Members of other faiths also spoke on the resurgence of antisemitism locally and nationally. Cardinal Sean Patrick O’Malley, who serves as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, said he was stunned to hear Jewish leaders’ testimony at a joint Catholic and Jewish community event about the measures Jewish folks must take to practice their faith safely.“I was horrified to hear about how they have to have their services with doors locked in all kinds of security and cameras and armed guards,” he said. “Racism and antisemitism have always been the original sins of our country, and we must never let our guard down.”Correction: This story was updated to correct the misspelling of Rabbi Shlomo Noginski's name."

Ed Markey said at an event announcing the grades along the Charles River in Cambridge. ""But this report card says we still have a long way to go, especially since we're being challenged by climate change.""The report cardsays extreme weather fluctuations linked to climate change have been impacting water quality in the watersheds. In 2021, record precipitation caused over 126 million gallons of sewage and storm water to be discharged into the Charles River. The following year, a severe drought caused the Charles to nearly run dry in places.Emily Norton, executive director of the Charles River Watershed Association, said urban areas along the river's path have worse water quality because they have more polluted stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows. She said the river is in better shape than it was in the mid-1990s — when the EPA launched the ""Clean Charles Initiative"" andformer Gov. Bill Weld famously jumped into the dirty water— but progress has stalled in recent years.""People keep asking us: 'IfParis can make the Seine swimmablefor the summer 2024 Olympics, why can't we swim in the Charles?'

Mill Creek flunked, and Alewife Brook and the Malden River got a grade of D.Markey noted that as a child, he was told by his mother not swim in the Malden River, because it wasn't clean enough. The new report gave that river a D grade.""So not enough has changed for those kids in Malden since the days when I was growing up there,"" Markey said. ""And that's why I urge all of our partners here to continue working together to secure healthy and safe watersheds for everyone.""""We should all be leaning in for the next 20 years of work,"" said Mystic River Watershed Association Executive Director Patrick Herron.

But, like the Mystic River watershed, the effects of both drought and increased precipitation have had a negative impact on smaller tributaries.""One of the things that is really clear from this year's data is the imprint of climate change on the results we're seeing,"" said Neponset River Watershed Association Executive Director Ian Cooke. ""This year we looked at three years' worth of data to compose the grades. One of those was a severe drought year. Two of them were very wet years.""Those intense downpours, Cooke said, have shifted what pollutants are harming our waterways.""Many of our lakes now are much more governed by fertilizer pollution and algae blooms in terms of their usability than they are the traditional bacteria indicator that we usually look at,"" he said. ""So definitely we need to do what we can to try to bend the curve on the future of climate change.""The water quality assessments are based on samples collected by hundreds of volunteers for the three watershed associations.

The show, produced in collaboration with El Planeta, is now in its second season. Tibisay Zea, the show's host, joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to talk about the new season. This transcript has been lightly edited.Saludairs Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. on GBH. It’s also available onApple Podcasts,Spotify, andother podcast platforms.Jeremy Siegel:You and I spoke at the outset of the initial launch of the show, and youtalked about the importance of focusing on health issues specific to the Latino community to combat misinformation and skepticism surrounding medicine. I want to talk about the importance of the way you're covering these issues and how this is a Spanish language show, because people listening know GBH as a station usually broadcasting in English. It's kind of an obvious question, I imagine, in some ways. But why is it important to have the show in Spanish?TibisayZea:This is a country that offers a lot of opportunities for immigrants like myself, but yet it is very unequal and it doesn't really offer the best standards of living for many people, which affects our health. And in fact, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy of any high-income country, which is only 76 years old. And something we found interesting and shocking at the same time is that Hispanics have higher risks of having many health problems like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and hypertension compared to other groups, in part because we are less likely to have health insurance and to receive preventive medical care, to have a primary doctor. And this is concerning.All of this has to do with the fact that our health system is very complicated here in the U.S. from how to qualify, how to enroll, how it works, you know, that terminology. You have co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, Medicare, Obamacare, Medicaid, all the different letters that arrive in the mail when you enroll in health insurance. So that can be very confusing and complicated to understand. It's overwhelming for most people. And imagine how it is for immigrants that are not familiar at all with how it works, and many times they don't have the language. So we think this podcast gives a critical voice to the diversity of the American experience in terms of health care, the voice of the Latinos, which is the population that keeps growing and growing. We believe this is just a public service for Spanish speakers in this country: High quality, reliable information about health care in Spanish. More than 40 million people speak Spanish in this country.Siegel:And you've already had one season of this show air on GBH. I'm curious, have you heard from any people about how they're receiving the show, people in the Latino community around here in Massachusetts about what it's meant for them?Zea:Yes, it was well-received. We launched our first season last year in the fall, and we got a lot of comments, people even suggesting new topics. They were interested. And actually, the first episode of our second season, in which we explained the many barriers and obstacles that Latinos have to access health care — that's an idea that came from one of our listeners that was so frustrated because she was getting all these letters in the mail that she couldn't understand, even though the letters were in Spanish. But they were just so confusing that she wanted to understand: Help me understand how to enroll in health insurance. So we decided to do a whole episode about how complicated our health care system is and how to map, how to navigate it. What I think is important is that we try to bring Latinos into the show to tell the stories.Siegel:So in addition to this episode that helps people figure out the complicated nature of the health care system, what else can someone who's tuning in this Saturday or catching up with the feed ofSaludwhere they get their podcasts — what can they expect this season? Any other topics you're particularly interested in having covered this year?Zea:So this time we have episodes on childhood obesity, oral health, also cardiovascular diseases. We have one episode that we highly recommend about the Fentanyl crisis, which is a well-documented national emergency, which is also affecting Latinos, many Hispanics in this country. We faced a lot of disadvantages in terms of access to health care. Part of it is because immigrants tend to have jobs with little flexibility to ask for — you know, days off to go to a medical appointment, for example, or we tend to have jobs with low pay. So many times, immigrants have to work multiple jobs or live in areas where there are less medical centers, less opportunities to exercise outdoors or to buy healthy food. And this is why we think that this podcast is important, because it's useful information in their language, and we are trying to just educate people on health care basics."

Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.Clinicians who wanted to prescribe the medicine had to complete an 8-hour training. They could only treat a limited number of patients and had to keep special records. They were given a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number starting with X, a designation that many doctors say made them a target for drug enforcement audits.""Just the process associated with taking care of our patients with a substance use disorder made us feel like, 'boy, this is dangerous stuff,'"" says Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, who chairs the American Medical Association's task force on substance use disorder.""The science doesn't support that but the rigamarole suggested that.""That rigamarole is mostly gone. Congress eliminated what became known as the ""X-waiver"" in legislation President Biden signed late last year. Now begins what some addiction experts are calling a truth serum moment.Was the X-waiver and the burdens that came with it the real reason only about 7% of clinicians in the U.S. were cleared to prescribe buprenorphine? Or was it an excuse that masked hesitation about treating addiction, if not outright disdain for these patients?There's great optimism among some leaders that getting rid of the X-waiver will expand access to buprenorphine and reduce overdoses. One study from 2021 shows taking buprenorphine reduces the risk by 50%. The medication is an opioid that produces much weaker effects than heroin or fentanyl and reduces cravings for those deadlier drugs.The nation's drug czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, says getting rid of the X-waiver will ultimately prevent millions of deaths.""The impact of this will be felt for years to come,"" Gupta says. ""It is a true historic change that, frankly, I could only dream of being possible.""Gupta and others envision obstetricians prescribing buprenorphine to their pregnant patients, infectious disease doctors adding it to their medical tool box, and lots more patients starting buprenorphine when they come to emergency rooms, primary care clinics and rehabilitation facilities.We are ""transforming the way we think to make every moment an opportunity to start this treatment and save someone's life,"" says Dr. Sarah Wakeman, the medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston.Wakeman says clinicians who she's been reaching out to for the past decade are finally willing to consider treating patients with buprenorphine. Still, she knows stigma and discrimination could undermine efforts to help those who aren't being served. In 2021, a national survey showed just 22% of people with an opioid use disorder received buprenorphine or methadone, which is another form of medication-assisted treatment.The truth serum experimentThe truth serum experiment – what will test whether clinicians will now step up prescribing – is underway in hospitals and clinics across the country as patients struggling with addiction queue up for treatment.One woman named Kim, 65, is among them.Kim's recent visit to the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center in southern Massachusetts began in an exam room with Jamie Simmons, a registered nurse who runs the center's addiction treatment program but doesn't have prescribing powers. NPR agreed to use only Kim's first name to limit discrimination linked to her drug use.Kim tells Simmons that buprenorphine has helped her stay off heroin and avoid an overdose for nearly 20 years. Kim takes a brand of the medication called Suboxone, which comes in the form of thin film-like strips she dissolves under her tongue.""It's the best thing they could have ever come out with,"" Kim says, ""I don't think I ever even had a desire to use heroin since I've been taking them.""Buprenorphine can produce mild euphoria and slow breathing but there's a ceiling on the effects. Patients like Kim may develop a tolerance and not experience any effects.""I don't get high on Suboxones,"" Kim says, ""they just keep me normal.""Still many clinicians have been hesitant to use buprenorphine – known as a partial opioid agonist – to treat an addiction to more deadly forms of the drug.Kim's primary care doctor at the health center never applied for an X-waiver. So for years Kim has bounced from one treatment program to another, seeking a prescription. When there were lapses in her access to buprenorphine, the cravings returned – an especially scary prospect now that the powerful opioid fentanyl has replaced heroin on the streets of Massachusetts, where Kim lives.""I've seen so many people fall out [overdose] in the last month,"" says Kim, her eyes wide, ""that stuff is so strong that within a couple minutes, boom.""Because fentanyl can kill so quickly, the benefits of taking buprenorphine and other medications to treat an opioid use disorder have increased as deaths linked to even stronger types of fentanyl rise. Buprenorphine is present in a small percentage of overdose deaths nationwide, 2.6% – virtually always with a mix of other drugs, often benzodiazepines. Fentanyl is in 94% of overdose deaths in Massachusetts.""Bottom line is, fentanyl kills people, buprenorphine doesn't,"" Simmons says.That reality adds urgency to Kim's health center visit because Kim took her last Suboxone before arriving. Her latest prescription has run out. Cravings for heroin could resume tomorrow if she doesn't get more Suboxone. Simmons confirms the dose and tells Kim that her primary care doctor may be willing to renew the prescription now that the X-waiver is not required. But Dr. Than Win has some concerns after reviewing Kim's most recent urine test.It showed traces of cocaine, fentanyl, marijuana and Xanax, and Win says she's worried about how the street drugs might interact with buprenorphine.""I don't want my patients to die from an overdose,"" Win says. ""But I'm not comfortable with the fentanyl and a lot of narcotics in the system.""Kim is adamant that she's not intentionally ingesting fentanyl. It might have been in the cocaine she says her roommate shares occasionally. Kim says she takes the Xanax to sleep. Her drug use presents complications that many primary care doctors don't have experience managing. Some clinicians are apprehensive about using an opioid to treat an addiction to opioids, despite compelling evidence that it saves patients' lives.Win is worried about writing her first prescription for Suboxone. But she agrees to help Kim stay on the medication.""I wanted to start with someone a little bit easier,"" Win says. ""It's hard for me, that's the reality and truth.""About half of the providers at the health center had an X-waiver when it was still required. Simmons says some of the resistance to having the waiver was rooted in stigma or misunderstanding about addiction. She urges doctors to treat addiction as they would any other disease.""You wouldn't not treat a diabetic, you wouldn't not treat a patient who is hypertensive,"" Simmons says. ""People can't control that they formed an addiction to an opiate, alcohol or a benzo.""Searching for solutions to soften stigmaAlthough the restrictions on buprenorphine prescribing are no longer in place, Dr. Mukkamala says the perception created by the X-waiver lingers.""That legacy of elevating this to a level of scrutiny and caution, that needs to be sort of walked back,"" says Mukkamala with the AMA. ""That's going to come from education.""Mukkamala sees promise in the next generation of doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants coming out of schools that have added addiction training. The AMA and the American Society of Addiction Medicine have online resources for clinicians who want to learn on their own.Some of these resources may help fulfill a new training requirement for clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine and other controlled narcotics. It will take effect in June. The DEA has not issued details about that training.But training alone may not shift behavior: take the experience of Rhode Island.The number of doctors approved to prescribe buprenorphine jumped more than 200% from 2016 to 2022 after the state said physician training should include an X-waiver. Still, having the option to prescribe buprenorphine ""didn't open the floodgates"" for patients in need of treatment, says Dr. Jody Rich, an addiction specialist who teaches at Brown University. The number of patients taking buprenorphine in Rhode Island increased – from 2016 to 2022 when the number of qualified prescribers jumped – but at a much slower rate .""It all comes back to stigma,"" Rich says.He says longstanding resistance among some providers to treating addiction is shifting as younger people enter medicine. But the opioid crisis can't wait for a generational change, he says. To expand buprenorphine access now, Rich's research shows states could use pharmacists, partnered with doctors, to help manage the care of more patients with an opioid use disorder.Wakeman, at Mass General Brigham, says it might be time to hold clinicians who don't provide addiction care accountable through quality measures tied to payments.""We're expected to care for patients with diabetes or to care for patients with heart attack in a certain way and the same should be true for patients with an opioid use disorder,"" says Wakeman.One quality measure could be to track how often prescribers start and continue buprenorphine treatment. Wakeman says it would also help if insurers reimbursed clinics for the cost of staff who aren't traditional clinicians but are critical in addiction care, like recovery coaches and case managers.Will ending the X-waiver close racial gaps?Wakeman and others are paying especially close attention to whether eliminating the X-waiver helps narrow racial gaps in buprenorphine treatment.The medication is much more commonly prescribed to white patients with private insurance or who can pay cash. But there are also stark differences by race at some health centers where most patients are on Medicaid and would seem to have equal access to this addiction treatment.At the New Bedford health center, Black patients represent 15% of all patients but only 6% of those taking buprenorphine. For Hispanics that comparison is 30% to 23%. Most of the health center patients prescribed buprenorphine are white, 61%, while they are just 36% of patients overall.Dr. Helena Hansen, who co-authored a book on race in the opioid epidemic, says access to buprenorphine doesn't guarantee that patients will benefit from it.""People are not able to stay on a life-saving medication unless the immense instability in housing, employment, social supports — the very fabric of their communities — is addressed,"" says Hansen. ""That's where we fall incredibly short in the United States.""Hansen says expanding access to buprenorphine has helped reduce overdose deaths dramatically among all drug users in France, including those who are low-income and immigrants. There, patients with an opioid use disorder are seen in their communities and offered a wide range of social services.""Removing the X-waiver,"" says Hansen, ""is not in itself going to revolutionize the opioid overdose crisis in our country. We would need to do much more.""This story is from of NPR's partnership with WBUR and KHN. KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

We got rejected in our records request,” Quattrochi said. “But, then once the proposal came out, a whole bunch of warning bells started to go off because we looked at who was on the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee and, in terms of campaign dollars donated, it's all developers. And you look at who's exempted under the rent control proposal and it's developers.“So we're trying to find out and we're trying to show if lobbying was at play here in the creation of this rent control proposal,” he said. “It seems like it’s going to benefit developers more than landlords and renters.”“The public has an interest in knowing what communications passed between [the city of Boston] and who became members of the committee, how the Mayor came to choose those particular individuals, and what motivation may exist for them to persist in advocating for policies know to economists and to the general public to be harmful and contrary to the public interest,” a portion of the legal complaint reads.Quattrochi noted that MassLandlords, which is based in Cambridge, was not invited to take part in the proposal’s crafting. Less than 5% of MassLandlords’ members reside in Boston. An even smaller portion operate housing within the city.Wu is seeking to set up a local rent control option for Boston, despite the policy being banned by statewide referendum in 1994. It would require approval from Boston City Council, the state Legislature and the governor to become law.The mayor’s proposal,now before the City Council,would restrict yearly rent increases to a maximum of 10% in high inflation years and the rate of inflation plus 6% in average years.Wu’s exemptions include: a 15-year shield for both new and past construction starting from the year the building’s certificate of occupancy was issued, and another for landlords who own six units or less and live on site with their tenants.Quattrochi said these exemptions leave out a large swath of landlords that could still reasonably be considered small and would be unfairly burdened.“If [the mayor] had actually talked to us, or invited us to sit on the committee, she would’ve heard immediately that there are so many of our members who live across the street from their properties or in the same neighborhood around the corner from [them], but they’re not in their properties,” he said.Wu’s proposal also calls for a rent control board or administrator to oversee local rent regulation. Quattrochi said that could create problems for small landlords who may end up needing to ask for permission to make certain improvements to their properties as they did under past rent control regulations while developers enjoy an extended exemption.Stakeholders across Greater Boston’s development sector are now publicly speaking out against Wu’s effort. The Greater Boston Real Estate launched a $400,000 campaign against rent control this month.The mayor has dismissed criticism of her proposal, insisting that it is the balanced approach necessary to allow stability for both housing operators and renters.While appearing on WBUR’s “Radio Boston” earlier this week, Wu expressed confidence that the transparency concerns raised in the lawsuit will be “sorted out,” and said, “many of the special interest groups who might be either listening to fearmongering or practicing fearmongering here really are just trying to stop a policy that that people are scared of.”“Whether it’s a group that is trying to put a lawsuit forward to just add more news and make sure that there’s as much potential delay in the process as possible, to others who are putting money behind an effort to put a message out there that this is taking us backwards, or assert that City Hall can’t do math or this or that — this is a different proposal that we’re putting forward now compared to what used to exist in Massachusetts and in many places decades ago, or even in some of the cities that are being brought up as examples of what to avoid,” Wu said.Quattrochi insisted the trade group will see the records request through.“If there were something in the emails, I think it would just further discredit the mayor’s proposal,” he said. “I think this rent control thing is just some incomprehensible distraction at best, and I'm worried that it’s actually been a lobbying effort of nonprofit and for-profit developers here. ... Whatever we find, we’re going to continue to look into this.”Last March, the group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain “any and all City of Boston emails to, from, or cc’ing” advisory committee members for the year before Wu announced them, according to the lawsuit filed late last week. The administration, after prodding from the state, only returned a welcome email dated the day after Wu publicly announced advisory committee members and a response stating that invitations to the committee were given through phone calls.“The implication that in the period March 2021 to March 2022 there were absolutely no email communications between any City department and any of the individuals who went on to become members of the Mayor’s Rent Stabilization Committee struck [MassLandlords] as not credible,” the lawsuit said.The filing goes on to decry rent control as a policy that will cause “availability discrimination,” a phenomenon where landlords hold properties vacant in order to select tenants with good credit scores and high income.MassLandlords’ legal complaint also implied a connection between the advisory committee members and contributions to various campaigns for public office. Seventeen of the 25 members put money toward “Massachusetts political races,” the lawsuit alleges.The group, Quattrochi said, is opposed to rent control in all forms, but would support a “Chapter 40P” program — named for the state law rent control carveout that allows cities and towns to enact rent control and pay landlords the difference between market rent rates and controlled rents."

JOHANNESBURG ‚Äî Anti-immigrant protesters clashed with foreigners during a march in South Africa's administrative capital, Pretoria, on Friday, and the police responded with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. President Jacob Zuma appealed for calm and condemned the latest wave of anti-foreigner violence to grip South Africa in recent years. ""Many citizens of other countries living in South Africa are law-abiding and contribute to the economy of the country positively,"" Zuma said. ""It is wrong to brand all nonnationals as drug dealers or human traffickers,"" he said. ""Let us isolate those who commit such crimes and work with government to have them arrested, without stereotyping and causing harm to innocent people."" Africans coming legally and illegally to South Africa, which has the continent's most advanced economy, have been the focus of criticism and resentment and sometimes of violent attacks in recent years. South Africans accuse migrants of stealing jobs or exploiting locals by running small businesses in poor, black townships. Others blame foreigners for the country's high crime rates. The accusations, which are not backed up by official statistics, resonate in a country with a jobless rate of 27 percent and yawning income inequalities. The latest anti-immigrant violence began in a neighborhood south of Johannesburg called Rosettenville, where residents burned down a dozen houses that they said were being used by Nigerians as drug dens and brothels. The attacks spread to other areas, including in Pretoria, where immigrant areas and businesses were targeted. New York Times"

""worried husband"" asked if it was ok to have a ""secret friendship"" with another woman. friendships help us get through life. one problem with our understanding of marriage is that it should be the ""be-all and end-all"" relationship. that is simply impossible. it's this wrong-headed belief that drives us to feel as if we must have ""secret"" relationships. if we can learn to develop honest relationships with our spouses (and our friends), we avoid the destructive baggage that comes with keeping secrets. your spouse doesn't need to know every single thing that you do or say or feel, but she/he does have the right to not be lied to. secrets, in the sense of this situation, are lies. sally a. i agree. thank you. send questions via e-mail to askamy@tribune.com or by mail to ask amy, chicago tribune, tt500, 435 n. michigan ave., chicago, il 60611."

""humankind"", which was produced at a small studio here and premieres in boston tomorrow at 3 p.m. on wbur (90.9 fm), profiles people from different walks of life striving in daily ways to make a difference.  in a time of widespread cynicism, ""humankind,"" the brainchild of award-winning documentary producer david freudberg, celebrates old-fashioned values - integrity, compassion, equality, and generosity.

""i strongly believe people are looking for a clear articulation of ideals and values,"" said freudberg, 43, who has worked in public radio since he was a teenager in philadelphia.  ""i think it's a very dangerous thing for our society to have the degree of cynicism that i see as being almost pervasive,"" said freudberg. ""it's corrosive, and i have been thirsting for some way in which the media can responsibly provide another road.""  ""humankind"" includes the voices of a man who drives a truck delivering food to homeless shelters; a former reporter who started a summer camp in maine for israeli and arab children; and an elderly woman who each week rides two buses and a subway to pick up food at a food pantry for her friend who can't get around easily.  driving a delivery truck for a food charity is ""a blessing,"" herman manigo told freudberg in one episode, ""because i've been where a lot of these people are now.  ""i mean, you can survive being broke, but it's very difficult when you don't have food on the table for your kids, because they don't understand that. now i have a chance to give back and i wouldn't trade it in for nothing in the world.""  other ""humankind"" episodes highlight a hospice in north carolina where patients receive free care; the effects on personal discipline of fasting, and personal questions about how individuals choose to donate to charity.  the people freudberg profiles aren't saints. they are simply ordinary people motivated by a sense of decency that freudberg says he found moving and inspiring.  listen to jerry smith, a counselor at seeds of peace, the summer camp in otisfield, maine, for israeli and palestinian youth, talk about what happens when youngsters who are supposed to hate each other have a chance to play and talk with each other.

income grew 0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in february, but after-tax income when adjusted for inflation increased just 0.2 percent in march. the gain followed two months of declines. consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, rose 2.9 percent in the january-march quarter - the fastest pace in more than a year. the increase was a bright spot in an otherwise weak first quarter for economic growth. but paul dales, senior us economist at capital economics, noted that stronger spending in january and february drove the quarterly increase. and consumers spent more while saving less, which suggests they cannot sustain their spending pace without better pay. ""real incomes will need to grow at a faster rate to prevent consumption growth from slowing,"" dales said. he noted that friday's report on april hiring is a crucial sign of where the economy is headed. the government reported friday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the january-march quarter. that's down from 3 percent annual growth in the october-december period. the weakness mainly reflected government budget-cutting and weaker business investment. in march, consumers spent 0.9 percent more on nondurable goods, such as clothing. spending on durable goods, such as cars and appliances, fell 0.3 percent. spending on services such as utilities and rent was mostly flat. an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in march. over the past 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the federal reserve's 2 percent inflation target after-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months compared with a year earlier. that was the smallest pay increase in two years. the savings rate edged up to 3.8 percent in march, after dropping to a 30-month low of 3.7 percent of after-tax income in february. a healthy job market could reinvigorate consumers. but the economy created just 120,000 jobs - half the pace of the previous three months. economists predict employers added 163,000 jobs this month, slightly better than march's figures but below the pace from december through february. one positive change since the winter: gas prices appear to have peaked. that would give consumers more to spend elsewhere. the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $3.81 on monday, down 8 cents from a month ago, according to aaa's fuel gauge report."

""umass-amherst becomes the brand of the public system,"" tocco said. critics, higher education officials who would talk only off the record about their concerns, say tocco's plan could put the five campuses, which now act like miniempires, on a collision course. while some say that tocco owes his ascension to the umass board to his close political ties to romney, others contend that tocco has become well-versed in higher education policy in the seven years he has headed the state board of higher education. state officials and educators credit him for pushing through key initiatives, including improving state and community college graduation rates. the initiative initially met with resistance, but college officials say tocco was dogged and eventually swayed college leaders. state college graduation rates in the past three years have gone from 44 percent to 49 percent.

Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack.

 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears.

""i'm just a big, kind, lovable teddy bear,"" he insists. civil rights and law enforcement officials around the world, particularly in germany, describe this american citizen in other terms: as an evil, dangerous provocateur. they say, and lauck agrees, that he is the no. 1 producer of neo-nazi propaganda distributed in germany, where even the possession of such material is outlawed. indeed, after quietly producing his wares for two decades in america's heartland, lauck is being thrust into an international spotlight by the post-reunification surge of neo-nazi activity in germany, and his role in promoting it.
lauck, during a two-hour interview near his home outside lincoln, maintained that his mission was just to help white people understand their interest in installing a fourth reich through electoral means. but german authorities say that his efforts have been anything but democratic, and that they fueled racial hatred and fomented violence. for instance, they said inflammatory stickers, newspapers and other materials traced to lauck were found during investigations of more than 70 hate crimes in 1991. and his influence, by all accounts, has mushroomed. while his background is somewhat sketchy, it is known that in 1972, lauck, at age 19, founded the national socialist german workers party-overseas organization, which has an estimated membership of fewer than 500 in this country. with the exception of the last two words, the group's name is identical to that of adolf hitler's nazi party. lauck subsequently engaged in a host of neo-nazi activities in the united states and abroad, but he has become most successful publishing a newspaper called ""the new order,"" printed in 10 languages. it includes virulent attacks on minority groups and jews. it features ads for nazi literature, tapes and cassettes of hitler's speeches, and it offers suggestions on how to smuggle such material into countries that prohibit its existence on their soil. fbi director louis freeh promised last month during a trip to germany to crack down on us purveyors of neo-nazi writings and paraphernelia. he did not cite lauck by name, but officials in both countries said in interviews that he was the chief target of freeh's vow. the officials acknowledged that pinning lauck down for a specific crime may prove difficult, however, since he and others often operate from this country expressly because of its constitutional protections. ""the problem is that his activities are not illegal in the united states,"" said susanne karkowski of the bundesamt fur verfassungsschutz, the german equivalent of the fbi. ""it's not for nothing that he operates from somewhere where he finds himself in a legal nirvana."" lauck does not reveal the location of his printing presses or the identities of his coworkers (""they have wives and children""). armed with the first amendment, he generally wages his international battles from close to home. he also sells his products domestically, but us officials dismiss his activities here as insignificant compared with their impact in germany and, to a lesser extent, in the splintered states of the former soviet union. ""it's one thing for this material to be distributed in new york, where there's so much of this kind of stuff and people are used to fringe politics, for example, but it's another thing for lauck's propaganda to act as virtually a match in the tinderboxes of central and eastern europe,"" said tom halperin, who along with irwin suall is director of fact-finding for the anti-defamation league of b'nai b'rith. dressed neatly in dark gray slacks, light gray sportcoat, white shirt and gray-striped tie, lauck repeatedly sought during an interview last week to stress a preference for nonviolence. the bloodthirsty images that the ""jewish-dominated media"" and ""germany's dictatorship"" seek to create, he said, are false and distorted. as if to underline his point, lauck presented even his most strident views in moderate tones, laced his comments with historical and literary references, and projected an affable persona. but the examples he cited of his good intentions belied the self-image he sought to project. he said he promoted force, for instance, only as a last resort to ""deprive jews of power"" and to get them to live in isolation. ""we could dictate terms before taking action,"" he suggested. ""if you will cease and desist from trying to subvert western civilization and exterminating the white race, then we can make a truce. . . . i don't care if we sit down and talk to these people or if we exterminate them, but i'd prefer to talk."" likewise, although he would like to segregate blacks in a country of their own, he said he would first try to do so through negotiation, because he felt sympathy for them.

""i don't beat my dog, and i feed him . . . but i don't give him equal rights or have sex with him."" even on key questions such as inducing poland to cede land to germany, lauck tried to offer clever solutions. ""we'll offer to bribe them, give them economic aid, which they'll take,"" he said, "". . . because we'll also tell them if you don't do this, we'll invade you and take back the territory and massacre you."" groups that monitor extremists - such as the anti-defamation league, the simon weisenthal center and the southern poverty law center - have tracked lauck for most of the 20 years he has been in the propaganda business. the fbi and the justice department's civil rights division have extensive files on him, according to officals of both agencies. as evidenced by the fact that he is still in business, dealing with extremists like lauck raises nettlesome legal, constitutional and ethical issues. john kundts of the fbi said ""it's more complex than a murder case or even a white-collar crime"" to determine how the self-styled propagandist can be prosecuted, since his operations are legal. but critics such as aaron breitbart, senior researcher at the wiesenthal center, pointed out that other democracies find ""it's perfectly legitimate to regulate freedom of expression at the point where, as with lauck, it leads to attacks and violence."" moreover, breitbart and others maintain that news organizations that write about neo-nazis may do some good by exposing their activities, but simultaneously provide their subjects with free publicity. on that count, at least, lauck agrees with his detractors. ""if you print an article in boston, mass., or any major city with a race problem, saying there's a guy publishing stickers that say 'deport niggers,' and he's in lincoln, neb., even if everything else says i'm a total monster or a total nut or a total lunatic - when i'm only 95 percent of those things - there will be people who want some of those stickers and write for literature,"" he said. ""then you get more literature in the field, and you get more support, you get more subscribers."" lauck was born in milwaukee in 1953 to parents of german ancestry, moved to lincoln as a child and began reading books such as hitler's ""mein kampf"" in his early teens. he said he skipped his senior year of high school, then concentrated on german-related courses during two years at the university of nebraska. at about age 17, gary rex lauck adopted the name gerhard ""for ethnic identification,"" and later apparently assumed something like a german accent and grew a mustache trimmed much like hitler's. lauck denied he affects an accent, saying his ""distinctive voice"" comes from having lived in milwaukee or having listened to german-speaking grandparents. while he portrays himself as relatively reasonable and said he was accepted by his parents and two siblings despite his views, police records paint a different picture. they show he was arrested in february 1978 for shooting his brother jerry, apparently after an argument about lauck's activities. jerry lauck survived, left the state and declined to press charges. lauck closely guards his activities, and german officals also do not like to discuss them. but sources said he routinely has used the us mail, often sending nondescript packages to phony post-office boxes, and also smuggled tons of material in the trunks of cars traveling over the german border from adjoining nations. he has been arrested in germany three times: in 1972 for distributing nazi literature, in 1974 for delivering a speech about ""why hitler is still so popular in the united states"" and in 1976 for toting around 20,000 nazi stickers. after serving 4 1/2 months in jail on that last charge, he was expelled from germany for life, although he was allowed back in 1979 to testify at a trial.  in the interview, lauck said he also has sneaked into the country several times since but prefers to meet with collaborators in neighboring nations. suall, of the anti-defamation league, was among several us officials who expressed hope that newfound fbi interest in lauck might finally lead to legal action against him.  ""this is a guy who provides ammunition to the most hateful kinds of people and, worse, influences young people,"" said suall. ""he's sufficiently dangerous . . . that his activities should be exposed, so concern becomes widespread enough for the american government to do something."""

the concert opened with two solos by soll herself, reinforcing her reputation as an extraordinarily compelling, articulate performer. ``disclosure'' (2010) was a powerful portrayal of an aging diva. with her turbaned head and gathered satiny skirt, soll was an elegant norma desmond type, reliving moments from a storied life in and out of the spotlight. as she walked, ran, lunged and skittered about the stage, gestures evoked a panoply of emotions. hands framed her face, clutching, covering. one arm cocked behind the head in a glamour shot. arms raised upward in a great curve, as if basking in applause, then dropped dramatically, casting it all aside. her period gazes to the audience were unnervingly direct. yet at one point, she fell, scrabbling backward and shielding her eyes from a bright sidelight, as if fleeing fame's glare. repeatedly she engaged, walking toward us resolutely before turning her back and taking a few steps away, as if she couldn't quite make the break with her adoring fans. ``tribute,'' given its world premiere, seemed almost a kind of prequel, though more internal and set to a flurry of spoken phrases, fractured and flowing forth in a variety of languages. she rushed onstage, adjusting the red belt of her dark gray coveralls, huffing ``i'm so tired, uno momento.'' she seemed to be talking more to herself than to us, urging, reassuring, censoring herself through bursts of activity with flourishes of dramatic gestures. it was like watching the process of creation. ``yes, no, basta'' she conversed with herself. ``ok. here goes'' launched a little hoochie-coochie dance, hips waggling side to side. ``just watch this'' ushered in slavic folk dance. it was riveting, humorous, and touching as she vaulted from moment to moment in a kind of creative frenzy. ``restless geometry'' (2010) was much less coherent. a work for seven dancers set to music from the 17th and 18th centuries juxtaposed with the sounds of frogs, crickets, birds, and wolves, it seemed to suggest how quickly civility can dissolve into savagery. balletic tendus and courtly bows cast in symmetrical patterns were subverted by chaotic runs and falls. ``life is a game. let's play,'' one of the dancers suggested, setting up freeze tag, catch, blind man's bluff. odd man out was accompanied by gossipy whispers, the fun taking on an edge of malice. the music invited dance, but most rhythmic phrases got quickly skewed by melodrama. at one point, the dancers dropped to their knees, hands behind their backs. they mimed taking turns beheading one another, then fell into nurturing embraces. in the end, one lone dancer costumed in green was encircled by the others. to the sound of frogs croaking, he curled on the floor, then slowly crawled forward to arise upright, as if to remind us we've all emerged from the swamp. karen campbell can be reached at karencampbell4@rcn.com dance review beth soll & company at: dance complex, saturday night"

Squaring off with Catholic Conference foe Xaverian in Middleton, the Eagles skated to a hard-fought 3-2 victory, making a final statement that they deserve to be in the conversation when the Division 1A Committee meets Saturday morning in Franklin.

Sophomore Josh Barton cut into the Prep lead just two minutes into the second, and sophomore Ryan Doo netted a shorthanded goal to tie the score at 8:59 of the period. The Eagles have proven to be nothing if not resilient this season, however, and bounced back with a power-play goal off the stick off senior forward Billy Fairweather late in the period to regain the lead.

""we're the ones who built this hospital,"" moore said as she joined other nurses at an informational picket line last week. ""now they want to let us go.""
like the other players in medicine, nurses are learning that they are not immune from the financial ills of the health care system. just a few years after they were being recruited to a recession-proof career with promises of big pay increases, nurses are encountering a very different world. boston university hospital and the brigham & women's hospital announced nursing layoffs recently, although there is still a chance that the cutbacks might be avoided. beth israel and deaconess hospitals have asked nurses to defer scheduled raises to save costs. at a number of hospitals, contract talks with nurses have dragged on for months, with the the two sides unable to agree on issues of pay and job security. picket lines are cropping up in front of hospitals like spring flowers. and the hard times are hitting just as the clinton administration is talking about expanding the role of nursing. in the reform plan that's due out next month, nurses may be asked to take on primary care duties that once were the domain of doctors. all of that may happen. in the meantime, nurses are nervous about the future. ""it's hard to be objective about change when you think your job may disappear,"" said therese smaha, a specialist in nursing issues for the massachusetts hospital association.  nurses are feeling the squeeze after a period of tremendous gains. in the 1980s and early 1990s, their ranks grew rapidly, and so did their paychecks. the average salary of a registered hospital nurse climbed from $ 26,000 in 1987 to $ 42,000 in 1992, according to the massachusetts hospital association.  in the peak years of 1988 and 1989, nursing salaries rose more than 15 percent a year. a nurse at a major boston teaching hospital can make more than $ 65,000 a year. salaries are lower at smaller hospitals, and considerably lower in nursing homes.  nurses have benefited from the law of supply and demand. a nursing shortage in the middle and late 1980s forced hospitals to bid wages up to attract more nurses. some hospitals offered prizes, like trips to bermuda and vcrs, for tips that led to the hiring of a nurse.  capitalism worked. nursing school enrollment soared, former nurses returned to work and the vacancy rate at hospitals dropped sharply. ""the nursing shortage doesn't exist anymore,"" said thomas lynch, executive vice president at newton-wellesley hospital.  instead, a patient shortage has developed. a combination of improved technology and steady pressure from health insurers has cut both admissions and lengths of stay at most massachusetts hospitals. boston university hospital, for instance, had more than 89,000 patient days in 1991. this year, the hospital expects to have just over 85,000. ""nurses will scoff at that and say they are busier than ever, but the facts don't bear them out,"" said maura mitchell, the hospital's vice president for nursing. the hospital plans to lay off about two dozen nurses, unless the union agrees to give up pay increases.  hospitals looking to cut expenses aren't ignoring nursing. at a typical hospital, nursing salaries and benefits can easily amount to 20 percent of total costs.  so far, most hospitals are trying to avoid layoffs by holding the line on wage increases. both newton-wellesley and faulkner hospital in boston have proposed not giving cost-of-living increases to nurses. instead, they would get a one-time bonus and normal pay increases for seniority. at several hospitals, management is trying to eliminate special weekend programs that were created during the shortage years. thus, nurses willing to work 12 hours on saturday and sunday are paid for a 36-hour week, and the hospitals say the incentive is costly and no longer necessary. the massachusetts nurses association, which represents nurses at many local hospitals, says giving it up would cause a hardship. more contentious than money issues are those of job security. specifically worrisome, nurses say, is the growing use of nurse technicians, another vestige of the shortage era. when nurses were hard to find, some hospitals began hiring lower-paid technicians to perform routine duties - giving baths, taking temperature and blood pressure - that don't require true nursing skills. the technicians take an 8- or 10-week training course at the hospital and are paid about $ 10 an hour; top-scale nurses can make more than $ 30 an hour in boston. ""they aren't there to help us, but to replace us,"" karen higgins said last week as she led a picket line of nurses outside boston university hospital. higgins and her colleagues marched in front of the hospital carrying signs that read: ""nurses are the solution, not the problem,"" and, ""who is caring for you?"" the nurses at bu hospital say it is continuing to hire technicians even as nurses are being laid off. they say further that the use of the technicians, who are unlicensed, compromises the quality of patient care. ""they can't replace us at the bedside with people who have minimal experience,"" higgins said. the hospital denies that care has suffered, or that technicians are replacing nurses. the number of technicians has grown only modestly over the past two years, according to a hospital executive. at other hospitals, administrators say technicians and others who are not nurses will play a bigger role, and that over time, the number of nurses in a given hospital will decline. ""nurses have to identify the tasks that don't require their level of expertise and give up those tasks to others,"" said judy miller, senior vice president for patient-care services at new england deaconess. such a strategy, miller said, will save money and free up nurses to work on the more interesting and satisfying part of nursing.  both metrowest medical center in framingham and winchester hospital are moving to new models of care that use nurses more sparingly. they insist the changes are not a threat to nursing, but they make no bones about the fact that efficiency is one of their goals. ""we have to recognize that our resources are limited,"" said ruth stark, director of public relations at metrowest. nurses are not defense workers or steelworkers. demand for their services is not going to disappear. even as jobs get cut in hospitals, new ones will open up in clinics, home health care and health maintenance organizations. nearly all labor market surveys predict that employment in nursing will continue to grow for the rest of the decade. those who are bullish about nursing's future see nurses moving up, performing more demanding and professional tasks. ""once we go through a transition period, nursing will have a stronger role,"" said judy miller of the deaconess. perhaps. but for now, nurses must cope with rising insecurity. ""i was going to retire at my hospital in 32 years,"" said a young nurse who lost her job recently at a boston teaching hospital. finding a new job is not that easy now, she said. finding one at a comparable salary may be impossible. back at the picket line at leonard morse, helen moore is worried. she hands leaflets to anyone who will take them.  several nurses standing nearby hold up red, white and blue balloons. one carries a sign that says, ""honk for nurses."" the hospital merged with framingham hospital last year to form metrowest medical center. to moore and others, the merger looks more like a takeover. one department, pediatrics, has already moved to framingham. others could follow, she said. moore has worked at leonard morse for 20 years. when she started, nurses were paid $ 4 an hour; top pay today is nearly $ 23 an hour. ""finally we are making not great money, but a fair income,"" she said. ""we don't want to lose that."" her words are drowned out by the honking of a horn from a passing truck. encouraged, moore smiles and goes back to the picket line."

For decades, nature took its course. As the Cape Cod sand dune continued to shift with the rolling ocean tides and high winds, it overwhelmed the wooden shed where the white Jeep Wagoneer had been parked, all but burying it. And there it stayed for roughly 40 years ‚Äî until Friday.
The aged vehicle was plucked this week from its unintended burial plot along Ballston Beach in Truro using a front-end loader and a chain. The Jeep, believed to be a model from the 1960s, was removed so the town can begin work ripping up a portion of an adjacent public parking lot at the popular beach, where the dune has started to encroach. Rather than fight back to preserve parking, the town is going to allow the dune to ""continue to move the way it wants to,"" said Emily Beebe, Truro's assistant health and conservation agent. ""It became important to get rid of this Jeep,"" she said. ""The town is going to be moving sand off of the east side of the Ballston Beach parking lot and, once the pavement is uncovered, removing pavement and restoring the sand."" The town and homeowner had talked about how to best remove the vehicle over the years, officials said. But because a coastal dune is a natural resource area under the Wetlands Protection Act, difficulty kept mounting. With the town ready to move ahead as soon as Monday with its project, removing the Jeep took on a new sense of urgency. ""It's not an easy process. But we walked them through it,"" Beebe said. ""[A Jeep] is not something you want to have in an area where you're going to have the ocean at some point washing in."" Witnessing the Jeep's removal may seem uninteresting, but it somehow captivated a national audience. This week, calls came in to Town Hall about the vehicle from as far away as Oregon, said Town Manager Rae Ann Palmer. Palmer was intrigued herself. She remembers seeing similar Jeeps cruising the streets as a kid. On Friday, as crews from Greg Morris Landscaping arrived at the private property and prepared to unearth it, Palmer stood nearby. Workers first peeled away the sunken shed's front doors, revealing the front-facing Jeep's smiling grille. A chain was attached to the loader and then wrapped around the vehicle's axle. With a groan and a crunch, the old vehicle was wrestled out of the garage. In the end, it arrived in two pieces. ""It was fascinating,"" said Palmer. ""They opened the garage, and it was like watching a time capsule being opened."" She added, ""as they started pulling it, you just see this rising of this Jeep, kind of coming up and out, and [the contractor] pulled it out and dropped it and it was this bucket of rust."" Among the heaps of metal, however, were relics of a bygone era still in decent condition. The steering wheel was intact, the pale-green dashboard was visible, and the hubcaps were still relatively shiny. Morris, the contractor hired to move the Jeep, said the homeowner's family made off with a few trinkets. ""It was a piece of history,"" he said. ""It's all taken away now.""

""we can buy it one day and get it the next day, as opposed to begging somebody else for it,"" fazzio said. kerafast splits its sales revenues with the research institutions that supply its inventory. bondaryk initially established the company as a nonprofit, with a mission to provide a new source of revenue for institutions at a time when federal support for research was waning. but he switched to a for-profit model because it allows kerafast to charge more for products and allow research institutions and the company to earn more. kerafast handles all the administrative work required to sell its products, including the legal agreements, which are necessary because the biologic materials are considered intellectual property. this is helpful especially f or smaller research institutions, such as brandeis university in waltham, where staff do not have the time or resources to seek out new homes for their surplus materials.

but monday night at the td banknorth garden, the petite british diva was all business, focused on only two things: singing and costume changes. the former was incredibly impressive, as brightman hit glorious highs, belted out robust lows, and mixed up a variety of styles from light opera to pop over the course of the two act, hour-and-45-minute performance. it was all super-serious, full of portentous - and loud - synthesizers providing orchestral flourishes. but there was little variance in mood. a gauzy read of kansas's '70s hit ""dust in the wind"" received the same furrowed-brow treatment as the churning ""phantom of the opera"" and the soaring ""ave maria,"" an achingly beautiful duet with brawny-voiced tenor fernando lima from brightman's recent album, ""a winter symphony."" it was all perfectly pleasant yet strangely polite, like the pbs pledge-drive entertainment it will surely become. the fashion portion of the show was intermittently entertaining, with brightman burning through ball gowns and tutus and stilettos like a dress-up-happy 8-year-old.

the hsi lai temple lunch will be featured when the senate campaign finance hearings resume today, with three nuns from the temple expected to testify that they served as conduits for tens of thousands of dollars of potentially illegal contributions from the church.  to defuse the controversy, gore's aides have mounted an aggressive defense of their boss - briefing reporters and releasing internal documents about the fund-raiser. after declining several requests during the past 15 months, gore's office agreed this week to release the globe from an off-the-record agreement that allowed this reporter to attend the fund-raiser, but that prohibited publication of details from the gathering. when the democratic fund-raising scandal broke last fall, gore said he thought the lunch had been a ""community outreach"" event. after the globe and other news organizations published the contents of memos from the vice president and his top aides that described the luncheon as a fund-raiser, gore acknowledged that he knew it was a ""finance-related"" event with traditional democratic donors invited.  but gore maintains that his staff did not tell him that the temple visit, which originally was scheduled as a non-political visit, had been transformed by mid-level party officials into a fund-raiser when plans for another southern california fund-raiser fell through. gore also says he did not know that temple members allegedly were pressured by those democratic officials to give tens of thousands of dollars in questionable contributions to the party after the luncheon and were then reimbursed by the taiwanese buddhist church.  the reporter accompanied gore on the marathon trip from washington to california on april 29, 1996, and interviewed the vice president on air force ii for a presidential campaign feature. the trip was packed with a variety of events, most prominently a midmorning speech to cable television executives in los angeles and a late-afternoon stroll with police on the beat in san jose. press secretary peggy wilhide and other members of gore's staff and security detail openly described two events on the day's schedule as ""fund-raisers"" closed to the press: the buddhist temple event in the los angeles suburb of hacienda heights and an evening reception in a private home in los altos hills, near san jose. upon request, gore's staff agreed to allow the globe into each occasion on an off-the-record basis.  after snarling traffic on the southern california freeways, gore's motorcade pulled up to the huge hsi lai complex shortly before 1 p.m. and was greeted by a high school marching band playing sousa tunes.  although the phrase ""buddhist temple"" might bring to mind a simple pagoda, the 15-acre hsi lai compound cost $ 30 million and includes a number of shrines and meditation halls, classrooms and conference rooms, a nunnery, a vip lodge, an auditorium, a museum, a large central courtyard, and two theme gardens with statues of arhats and bodhisattvas - buddhist holy beings.  the complex is the largest buddhist monastery in the western hemisphere. yun has built an international congregation of a million followers from his base in taiwan. gore first visited yun in taiwan in 1989 and then hosted the buddhist leader at the white house in march 1996.  gore's staff was warned to use ""great, great caution"" and to beware of a ""hidden"" taiwanese agenda in yun's dealings with gore, according to an april 19, 1996, memo from robert suettinger, a national security council official. yet the correspondence among the white house staff shows that gore's advisers and democratic finance officials repeatedly characterized the lunch as a prime fund-raising opportunity.  congressional investigators believe that two democratic party operatives, john huang and maria hsia, pushed to bring gore and the prosperous taiwanese buddhists together, arranged the luncheon, presided at the fund-raiser, and returned to the temple in the following days to press for contributions from nuns and monks who were later reimbursed by the church.  under state and federal law, non-profit institutions may not host partisan political events and retain their tax-favored status. individuals are prohibited from making political contributions in their own names only to be reimbursed by another individual or organization.  through statements issued by their attorneys, hsia and huang have denied any wrongdoing. in a statement to senate investigators released last month, yun accepted responsibility for the contributions from members of his temple but said his organization was only trying to honor gore and express its gratitude to the united states. he said the mistakes occurred because of a misunderstanding of us campaign laws. a prime question at the senate hearings will be what gore knew. gore says he knew the lunch guests were members of the democratic party's ""asian pacific american leadership council."" his briefing book that day noted membership in the group ""requires an annual contribution of $ 2,500 per person or $ 5,000 per couple."" his ""role"" at the luncheon was to ""extend appreciation for participant support and inspire political and fund-raising efforts among the asian pacific american community."" although representative robert matsui, a democrat from california, and don fowler, chairman of the democratic national committee, took turns thanking the audience for supporting the administration, gore chose not to use the partisan ""talking points"" from his speechwriters criticizing republican bob dole and house speaker newt gingrich. instead, gore and yun spoke of tolerance and religion. the vice president nibbled at his vegetarian meal, exchanged gifts with yun, posed for photographs with the 70 monks clad in saffron robes, and stood for a moment of reflection before a giant statue of sakyamuni buddha."

justice antonin scalia said using the federal ``material witness'' statute to detain abdullah al-kidd as a material witness in a terrorism investigation does not give kidd a right to sue, because no court precedent had found such a use of the statute unlawful. ``qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions,'' scalia wrote. ``when properly applied it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. ashcroft deserves neither label.'' all eight justices hearing the case agreed that kidd's suit against ashcroft could not go forward; justice elena kagan sat out the case because she had worked on ashcroft's behalf as president obama's solicitor general. but there was disagreement about the government's action in the case and the treatment kidd received. kidd maintains that in his more than two weeks of detention, he was strip-searched, shackled, interrogated without an attorney present, and treated as a terrorist. justice ruth bader ginsburg, in a separate opinion joined by justices stephen breyer and sonia sotomayor, said kidd's ordeal ``is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity, constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times.''

Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

capuano, a democrat from somerville who sits on the house transportation committee, said last night that he filed the bill in reaction to the july 10 ceiling collapse that took the life of milena del valle of jamaica plain. investigators quickly determined that the ceiling came down when a handful of bolts used to suspend it from the roof gave out. if inspectors had gone into the 5-foot-high crawl space above the suspended ceiling after the tunnel opened, they probably would have noticed bolts pulled out, perhaps alerting them to the danger of collapse, investigators have said. ""clearly, more must be done to ensure the safety of the traveling public,"" capuano said. ""apparently, if inspections are not required, they won't be done. this bill would require those inspections."" capuano's bill is modeled on the federal bridge program, which mandates inspections of bridges at least every two years. ""the bridge program means that when you drive over a bridge you know it's been inspected,"" he said. in the absence of a federal inspection program for tunnels, the massachusetts turnpike authority, which oversees the big dig, set its own inspection schedule. in the case of the interstate 90 connector tunnel where the collapse occurred, the turnpike had last inspected the ceiling in 2000, when it was built. the connector opened for traffic in 2003. but while state officials conducted a preopening safety check of the roadway surface and walls, no one got into the crawl space to view the hanger assembly that included the bolts. turnpike authority officials said after the collapse that they had been planning to inspect the connector later that summer, to fulfill legal obligations the authority assumed when selling billions of dollars in bonds to investors. turnpike officials interpreted their agreement with bondholders to mean that no inspection of the connector was required in 2003, its first year of use, when older sections of the big dig were inspected. after the ceiling collapse, investigators found 225 ceiling bolts in the connector that had pulled out of the roof at least a fraction of an inch, in addition to the 20 that had ripped out to cause the collapse. work crews have since abandoned the hanger assembly system that relied on epoxy to hold the bolts in holes drilled into the concrete roof. the new assembly system locks the bolts into place using grooves cut into the roof. also, officials have greatly increased the number of bolts carrying the weight of the concrete ceiling. capuano said he expected little opposition to the bill. he said the chairman of the transportation committee, james l. oberstar of minnesota, a democrat, had assured him of swift action."

Some kids moan when asked to do math homework; others chatter about what they learned in class that day. A student's feelings toward math ‚Äî and perhaps other subjects ‚Äî can impact his or her classroom achievement over time, according to a long-term study of middle-school students.
Regardless of a student's intelligence or economic background, those who took pride in and enjoyed math had better grades over time during the study, while performance spiraled downward for those experiencing anger, anxiety, or shame about the subject. ""Emotions are a powerful driver of students' learning,"" says study author Reinhard Pekrun, a professor of psychology at the University of Munich in Germany. The findings, published this month in the journal Child Development, should encourage parents, teachers, and administrators to bolster positive emotions and reduce negative emotions when it comes to math, says Pekrun. And that doesn't mean putting on a smile every time you talk about fractions. Clear, enthusiastic instruction ‚Äî during which a student is engaged rather than anxious or bored ‚Äî can promote a self-reinforcing path to academic success. The study relied on data from the Project for the Analysis of Learning and Achievement in Mathematics, or PALMA, which followed 3,425 German students from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds during grades 5 through 9. Researchers tracked students' grades and math test scores, and gave them a survey each year to probe their feelings about the subject. Other studies have examined the link between learning and children's emotions, but most focused on a single moment in time, such as one day or week of learning. The PALMA study, on the other hand, tracked learning and the effect of emotion over years. Overall, the results were as one might expect: Positive emotions were beneficial to learning while negative emotions were detrimental. Yet they do contradict the theory that if you enjoy something, you might not put as much effort into it. During five years of schooling, students with high intelligence had good grades and test scores, but those who also enjoyed and felt proud about their math work had even higher achievement. And students who experienced negative emotions ‚Äî anger, anxiety, shame, boredom, you name it ‚Äî were more likely to have lower achievement. The findings held true no matter a child's economic background, gender, or general intelligence, and the correlations got stronger as the years went on. ""Students who get positive feedback develop positive emotions, learn better, and their enjoyment further increases,"" says Pekrun. ""For those who are bored or anxious, performance deteriorates, they get negative feedback, become even more anxious or hopeless, and continue to spiral downward."" Educators can prevent negative feedback loops, and promote positive ones by being knowledgeable, and not anxious, about their subject or those emotions can pass onto the children, says Pekrun. He also suggests that teachers avoid competitive evaluations, which creates winners and losers, thereby sparking negative emotions in the latter. ""It drives too many students into states of panic, anxiety, hopelessness and, in the end, boredom,"" says Pekrun. ""And boredom is the prime cause for failed education.""

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Attempting to put a defining framework on his tumultuous first month in office, President Trump on Friday articulated a new vision for the Republican Party as a populist defender of the working class that will challenge elites at home and abroad. Trump, speaking to hard-line GOP activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, made it clear how much the world has changed for rank-and-file Republicans since his insurgent campaign upended the party.
At times, he promoted positions that could have been ripped from the playbook of liberals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. ""The GOP will be from now on the party also of the American worker,"" Trump declared. ""First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents,"" he added. ""The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first."" In a wide-ranging, campaign-style speech, Trump bashed the media, and reiterated his promises for a massive buildup of the American military, the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, and the renegotiation of trade deals. He pointed to his administration's efforts to cut back regulations as a key way to promote job growth and protect workers. After his speech, Trump signed a new executive order requiring agencies to form regulatory reform task forces to assess additional ways to eliminate regulations. The enthusiastic response to Trump's speech marked a complete turnaround for the nation's premier gathering of conservatives, which had once greeted him with skepticism. At his first appearance at the conference in 2011, Trump walked out to the song ""Money"" and drew laughs and boos from the crowd. Last year, Trump declined an invitation to speak at the event.On Friday, he explainedthat absence by sayinghe worried his ideas would be ""too controversial."" But Friday's remarks represented Trump's attempt to recast the Republican Party ‚Äî and the conservatives who represent its base ‚Äî in his own image. At one point, he said, ""Now you finally have a president, finally,"" and at another point, he said the Middle East is in ""much worse shape than it was 15 years ago"" ‚Äî a timeframe that extends back to the presidency of Republican George W. Bush. The crowd reveled in chants of ""lock her up,"" echoing last year's campaign chants targeting Hillary Clinton, and ""USA! USA!"" underscoring Trump's appeals to nationalism. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's joke earlier in the week that CPAC should be renamed ""TPAC"" in honor of the president seemed more fitting. Trump's appearance Friday was the first by a sitting president since Bush spoke in 2003 and the first by a president in his inaugural year in office since Ronald Reagan in 1981. In all, Reagan spoke at CPAC 13 times. Trump said he plans to make annual visits to the conference. Vice President Mike Pence compared Trump to Reagan in his speech Thursday night. ""I believe President Trump has given voice to aspirations and frustrations to Americans like no leader since Reagan,"" he said. In his own speech, Trump assailed the Affordable Care Act, blamed President Obama for leaving him with ""a mess,"" and promised to halt illegal immigration. But as he gears up to deliver a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, lawmakers are going to be looking for more specifics, including how to fund his proposals. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are still trying to figure out exactly how to replace the federal health care law. They're also dealing with the lingering backlash to Trump's executive order on immigration, which sought to bar immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations before it was halted by the courts. Across the aisle, Democrats have been energized by the Trump administration, vowing to stall and prevent the president's agenda at every chance they get. Trump did not once mention his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in his speech, a surprising omission given the choice was widely heralded by conservatives. He did, however, deliver a blistering critique of the media, attacking ""fake news"" and journalists' use of anonymous sources. ""It doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it,"" Trump said about the media.""Many of these groups are part of large media corporations that have their own agenda."" His attack on the media's use of anonymous sources came less than an hourafter White House officials held a background briefing ‚Äîdemanding anonymity ‚Äî with journalists to dispute a CNN story. CNN had reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked the FBI to push back against media reports about communications between Trump aides and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. The vision Trump outlined Friday was a less extreme version of the worldview expressed by Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, who spoke Thursday about the ""deconstruction of the administrative state."" Bannon, making a rare public appearance, took the stage with Priebus and the two played down any conflict between them. But, a day before Trump's speech, attendees at CPAC on Thursday were still coming to grips with his new party and wrestling with questions of whether he is a true conservative. ""He has evolved and he understands the importance of the values of the conservative moment,"" said Kirk Lippold, who was the commanding officer of the USS Cole when it was bombed in Yemen in 2000. ""I think that while Donald Trump was elected because they believe he is a conservative, they are watching him do things that now support that,"" he said. Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, the group that hosts CPAC, agreed, pointing to Trump's first month in office as evidence of his conservative principles.

according to rotello, who published an article on the subject in wednesday's new york newsday, silber recalled that he responded to dobbs by saying that ""most of us consider sexuality a private concern,"" and that he was sick of ""so-called gay people trying to force their sexual lifestyles down everybody's throats, insisting on turning every meeting into a testimonial on sexual preference."" silber said in the interview with rotello that homosexuality ""had no place in a discussion concerning children, for whom homosexual orientation is not an issue . . . decent parents don't even discuss the possibility that there are homosexuals."" the controversial bu president, who was well known for making statements dubbed ""silber shockers"" in his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 1990, added that there was no place for gays in a multicultural curriculum, because ""gayness is not a culture."" ""if you make it a culture you've got to have a culture of hamburger eaters and pastrami eaters, too,"" silber said, according to rotello's transcipt of the conversation. silber declined to talk to the globe. but in a letter that silber wrote to wiesel, a bu professor, silber does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes attributed to him by rotello. instead, he disputes rotello's description of how dobbs interrupted the forum and how silber allegedly ""exploded"" in response. ""dobbs burst into the discussion with a tirade denouncing the conference because of the absence of any gay person on the panel,"" silber wrote to wiesel. ""and my response, far from an explosion, was a calm examination of the issues."" ""i pointed out that dobbs could not possibly know how many 'straight' or 'gay' people were among the panelists because only he had declared himself with regard to his sexual preference. i pointed out that he did not know mine and i did not know the sexual preference of the other people in the room,"" silber wrote. ""i made it clear that i refused to be intimidated by his dobbs' hatred for people who do not endorse his lifestyle,"" silber wrote in the letter, dated dec. 3, which was provided by bu. dobbs could not be reached for comment yesterday. in the letter, silber goes on to defend his record on gay issues in his 22 years at boston university, saying he has ""consistently upheld their legal and constitutional rights"" and employed many ""homosexuals at all levels."" ""the point at which homosexuals and i part company is when they try to make public proclamation of our sexual orientation and demand that everyone endorse their lifestyle as normative,"" silber wrote. ""no one is under any obligation to endorse the homosexual lifestyle although all of us have an obligation to respect the rights of individuals who are homosexual,"" he wrote. ""we should refuse to be intimidated by bullying homosexual activists when they intrude on meetings and try to disrupt them. ""it is time we publicly refuse to endorse this way of living as normative."" ""every society, religious institution, and parent has a perfect right to encourage heterosexuality as that mode of sexual expression most conducive to strong families and to happy and fulfilled individual lives,"" silber concludes in the letter. the nov. 15 forum was reportedly videotaped, but the foundation did not respond to a globe request for a copy of the tape. a spokesman for new york university said the forum was not an nyu event and the school had no tape of the proceedings. rotello said, however, that he was confident silber repeated the essence of what he said at the nov. 15 forum in his telephone interview nov. 25. ""i called him and said that i understood there was a run-in between him and a gay activist at a forum, and he showed no hesitation in repeating his comments,"" rotello said yesterday. ""i then read all those quotes to mr. dobbs, who said that was exactly what silber said."" silber was joined on the panel by arthur gelb of the new york times foundation, washington post columnist lally weymouth, producer fred friendly and vincent galasso, principal of the bronx high school of science. they could not be reached yesterday."

Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

""we can't build our way out of the problem and we can't punish our way out of the problem,"" said house speaker charles f. flaherty (d-cambridge), who championed the alternative sanctions idea.  rep. emanuel g. serra (d-east boston), who chaired a sentencing study committee appointed by flaherty, said it costs the state $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate, compared to about $ 6,000 a year for alternatives such as house arrest, electronic monitoring, community service or rehabilitation programs.  serra said statistics show that the recidivism rate is more than double among inmates who are released to the community directly from prison, compared to those who attend community corrections programs.  flaherty formed the study in response to a september globe spotlight team report which revealed that big-time drug dealers often bargain their way out of mandatory sentences by forfeiting drug profits, while first-time offenders are often given longer terms.  as part of a prison construction bond bill, the house is expected to vote today on another proposal from serra's committee that would give judges greater leeway to vary so-called mandatory sentences, providing they document why.  in a move to bolster the beleaguered department of social services, the house voted $ 4.9 million to hire additional social workers.  house ways and means chairman thomas m. finneran (d-mattapan) said the money will be earmarked for social workers to reduce caseloads.  gov. weld asked for $ 5.1 million in september to hire more than 100 new case workers, and an additional $ 8.8 million last month to help overburdened foster parents and provide more alternatives to traditional foster care.  yesterday the house voted to approve an additional $ 1 million to speed up the adoptions of special needs children who have languished in state care because of a lack of funding to process their cases.  another house vote would make it easier for the registry of motor vehicles to handle the unexpected costs of the ""sick building"" problems in its boston headquarters."

""it always seemed so special here,"" beauregard, 59, said softly, seated on a chair in the living room. ""when i was a young girl, i saw that the nuns were dedicated to their faith. they were happy. they were living together."" convent life at st. joseph may soon end. the three-story convent is expected to close, along with st. joseph church, some time over the next six months. the 131-year-old, french-canadian parish is among 65 scheduled to close as part of a massive reconfiguration of the archdiocese of boston. st. joseph school won't close, howev er. that will move across town to the old st. james school on federal street. the rev. lawrence rondeau, pastor of st. joseph, has appealed to archbishop sean p. o'malley to keep st. joseph open. in addition to the school, rondeau has cited the parish's thriving hispanic ministry, and a food pantry that serves 3,000 people each month in salem. if the parish closes, the sisters will lose their home. and salem has no other convent for them. other parishes closed or sold their convents amid a wave of catholic school closings in the 1970s. unlike parish priests, nuns do not work for the archdiocese. they work for their religious orders. ""we are not a diocesan community,"" said beauregard, the school's third-grade teacher. ""we belong to our congregation. . . . each parish with a school usually has a convent, but at st. james, there isn't one."" and if the convent closes, where will the sisters live? ""we don't know,"" said richard, 70, the school librarian. ""that's the honest truth."" since the parish closing was announced may 25, the sisters have spent much of their time consoling parishioners and reassuring parents that st. joseph school will stay open. they say they haven't had time to think about their own future. ""people here are upset,"" said richard, who grew up just blocks from the convent. ""we can't add to their burden. . . . i guess when the decision is final, we'll go see what's out there."" ""i know god will always take care of us,"" said grenier, 69, a special education teacher at the school. ""in the past, he always has . . . i cannot say i have lost my peace about this."" but st. joseph parents worry for the nuns' future. at a meeting last week to discuss the school move, a parent asked, ""what about our sisters?"" the sisters were asked to stand. they received a prolonged ovation from more than 100 parents and teachers that packed the school hall. monsignor paul v. garrity, the vicar for salem who ran the school meeting, didn't have an answer. ""it's one of those questions that really has to be looked at,"" he said. in an interview, garrity said the nuns probably will have to find their own housing. nuns involved in social work, health care, and other non-parish ministries often rent their own apartments. ""sisters today do receive a stipend,"" he said, adding he is sympathetic to the nuns. ""many of them come together to determine how they'll live."" the st. joseph nuns would like to stay together. ""this has been a wonderful community to be part of,"" said grenier, who moved to the convent 19 years ago. ""very good women live here."" but it may not be possible for them to stay together. a four-bedroom apartment or house is scarce. they also are expensive, particularly around st. james, which stands in the heart of the mcintire historic district, a neighborhood of stately federalist and georgian homes. ideally, they would like to be close to the school. the sisters, all of whom took a vow of poverty, pool their salaries. although they live rent-free at the convent, they pay for utilities, food, and other household necessities. each lives on a small budget to cover personal expenses, such as clothes and medications. when the school moves to st. james, the parish and school will pay their stipend. their order, too, will give them a stipend. but the sisters are still bracing for higher housing costs. ""it's going to be different,"" said richard, who takes care of convent finances. ""our order will help us some, but how much we're not sure."" although the sisters have quietly started asking around about apartments, they're prepared for the possibility that they may not be able to live together. ""the chances are not all of us will be together,"" said richard, who has lived at st. joseph for 33 years. ""we need space. we're used to having a whole house. . . . apartment living is going to be a big adjustment for us."" still, despite their own needs, the nuns remain focused on parish life. st. joseph serves salem's poorest neighborhood. more than half of its 900 families are hispanic, most of them immigrants from the dominican republic. the church has the only spanish mass in salem. it runs the largest food pantry. despite the many demands, the parish has no debt, parish officials said. the nuns thought st. joseph would survive the parish closings. they were heartened when o'malley said he would give special preference to parishes with schools, and serving new immigrants. ""when i heard that, i thought, 'we're out of the woods,' "" said beauregard. ""that's why this has all been so shocking."" they can't help but question the decision. ""i don't know what his [o'malley's] definition of poor is, if it is not here,"" richard said. ""i think these closings have not had any compassion for people,"" grenier said. ""from the start it has always been about buildings and property. that's where there has been no compassion."" beauregard has a special attachment to the convent. her uncle and father help build it in 1962, when the original convent had to be torn down. the new convent, with a private chapel and communal living space, had private bedrooms for 30 nuns. ""they built this house,"" she said proudly. and their quiet presence in the hardscrabble neighborhood has been a blessing. grenier discovered that on mother's day. as she was returning to the convent in the afternoon, a hispanic man in his 30s ran up to her. she recognized him as the man she waves to every day at the start of her 6 a.m. walk around salem. he gave her a big hug. ""he said to me 'happy mother's day, mom,' "" grenier said, a big smile on her face.

Now, the finding by Malaysian police that Kim Jong Nam was assassinated with VX nerve agent is a stark reminder of the North's lesser-known weapons of mass destruction: a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. Kim, the estranged elder brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was killed Feb. 13 when two women rubbed his face with the nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the police said Friday.
If North Korean nationals were indeed behind the killing, as Malaysian officials suggest, the use of VX raises several questions: Was the North Korean government using the attack to signal to the world its fearsome arsenal of such dangerous weapons? Or was the toxin simply an attempt to avoid detection in carrying out a brazen killing at one of the world's busiest airports? ""By using VX in an international airport in the heart of Asia, North Korea has sent a very clear message to the world that it will strike its enemies anywhere in the world,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on terrorism at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""It also demonstrates the North Korean response in the event of an attack against North Korea,"" Gunaratna said. North Korea's nuclear program has long been the most urgent concern of the United States and its allies, and the now-dormant six-party talks to curb the program did not address chemical and biological weapons. ""The reported use of VX reminds us that not only is the North's nuclear-missile threat serious but so are its asymmetric threats, including biochemical weapons and cyber that are all part of the regime's WMD tool kit,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. South Korea's Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed ""shock"" at the use of a chemical weapon and vowed to work with the international society to deal ""strongly"" with the violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The deadly use of a chemical weapon banned by international conventions could strengthen calls for the United States to put North Korea back on a list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, analysts said. The North was first put on the terrorist list after its bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in 1987, killing all 115 people onboard. But the United States delisted the country in 2008 as part of an agreement aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programs ‚Äî a deal that has since disintegrated. After his announcement that Kim had been killed by VX nerve agent, Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police, said Friday that small amounts of the poison could have been brought into the country without being discovered. Two women have been arrested in the killing, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam. The attackers could have used a safety-enhancing battlefield form of the agent. Known as VX2, it is divided into two compounds that are harmless individually but become lethal when mixed together. If Kim's two assassins had each applied one component of VX, this would explain why two assassins were needed, how they survived the attack, and perhaps why it took 15 minutes or more for Kim to die. ""Use of a binary nerve agent lends itself to this method and allows for a potentially highly targeted hit,"" said Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has two degrees in chemical engineering. Narang said it was clear that North Korea wanted the West to know what it is capable of ‚Äî but without causing mass casualties. ""They wanted everyone, especially the US, to know it was VX and that they can make it or have it,"" he said."

The department store giant's latest quarterly results, also released Friday, illustrate its struggle to connect with shoppers: Sales were down 0.7 percent at stores open more than a year. And yet the report also demonstrated that the chain, unlike department store rivals such as Macy's and Sears, has had improving momentum lately. The company managed to deliver a net profit in 2016, the first time it has done so since 2010. J.C. Penney's decision to close stores comes as many industry executives and analysts say that old-school chains are ""overstored,"" meaning they have too many locations for the era of online shopping. Macy's is in the process of closing 100 stores and eliminating some 10,000 jobs. Sears said in January it would close 150 stores, some from its namesake chain, and some from the Kmart chain.

It expects the closures will result in $200 million of annual cost savings. It is not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected by the closures.

on the podium this week is the german maestro kurt masur, who is not a bad guy to have around for a mendelssohn birthday party. at 81, he has lived with this music for well over half a century; he has recorded large quantities of it; and he was music director of the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra for more than two decades, a post that the composer held. this year masur is traveling around the world championing mendelssohn, who, while hardly neglected, still sometimes has to argue his way into the very top ranks of 19th-century composers. last night, in warm and spacious performances, masur and the orchestra showed just how silly that argument is. the masterfully drawn, richly atmospheric ""hebrides overture,"" written after a visit in 1829 to the hebrides islands off the coast of scotland, came across with just the right blend of clarity and mystery. the strings had a burnished yet mellow tone, anchored by the cellos. all those rippling figurations in the violins came across, as they should, like wind over water. the ""scottish"" symphony no. 3 owes its inspiration to the same summer travels, yet the work was completed in 1842. last night there was a natural, just-so quality to the unfurling of the lines and the pacing more generally. in the first movement, masur drew a striking pianissimo sound from the orchestra, quiet yet well-supported. the scherzo was duly light and diaphanous, and the adagio cantabile had the gentle singing quality requested by its name. in the fourth movement, masur coaxed some emphatic playing from the orchestra, lending the textures an almost beethovenian heft without sounding forced or false. masur, of course, knows the orchestra well from his guest visits over the years, but last night there was a more elusive quality in that mysterious way an ensemble can sometimes channel a conductor's musical personality for an evening. in that spirit, this was mendelssohn with commitment and integrity. jeremy eichler can be reached at jeichler@globe.com"

administering the vaccines in either order is likely to provide potent protection, matthew snape, a vaccine specialist at the university of oxford, said at a news conference monday. snape and his colleagues began the trial, called com-cov, in february. in the first wave of the study, they gave 830 volunteers one of four combinations of vaccines. some got two doses of either pfizer or astrazeneca, both of which have been shown to be effective against covid. others got a dose of one vaccine, followed by a dose of the other. for the first wave of volunteers, the researchers waited four weeks between doses. studies have found the astrazeneca vaccine provides stronger protection if the second dose is delayed up to 12 weeks, so the researchers are also running a separate 12-week trial which should deliver results next month. the researchers found that volunteers reported more chills, headaches, and muscle pain than people who get two doses of the same vaccine. snape and his colleagues then drew blood to measure the immune response in the volunteers. they found that those who got two doses of pfizer-biontech produced levels of antibodies about 10 times as high as those who got two doses of astrazeneca. volunteers who got pfizer followed by astrazeneca showed antibody levels about five times as high as those with two doses of astrazeneca. and volunteers who got astrazeneca followed by pfizer reached antibody levels about as high as those who got doses of pfizer. he said the differences would most likely narrow in the volunteers who get a second dose after 12 weeks, when the astrazeneca vaccine has had more time to strengthen its effects. the study also found that using different vaccines produced a higher level of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus than did giving two doses of the same vaccine. snape said it wasn't clear yet why mixing had that advantage. new york times 3rd astrazeneca dose boosts immune response a third dose of the vaccine developed by astrazeneca and the university of oxford generated a strong immune response in clinical trial volunteers, oxford researchers said monday. the finding indicates that the astrazeneca vaccine could be an option should third shots end up being needed, for example, to extend immunity. to date, the vaccine has been given as two doses, typically between 4 and 12 weeks apart. the new data, detailed in a preprint manuscript, came from 90 study volunteers in britain who were among the earliest to receive the shots in a clinical trial last year. in march, they were given a third dose, roughly 30 weeks after their second. laboratory analyses showed that the third dose increased levels of antibodies to the virus in the volunteers to a point higher than seen a month after their second dose ‚Äî an encouraging sign that the third shot would be likely to bring greater protection if the effectiveness of two doses waned over time. new york times worried about delta, who urges vaccinated to mask world health organization officials, concerned about the easing of precautions meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus even as the most contagious variant to date has emerged, have urged even fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and to keep taking other measures to prevent infection. the centers for disease control and prevention, on the other hand, told fully vaccinated americans in may that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or to maintain a distance of 6 feet from other people. the agency also eased advice about testing and quarantine after suspected exposure to the virus. asked on monday about the new cautions expressed by the who ‚Äî the world's largest public health organization ‚Äî a cdc spokesperson pointed to the existing guidance and gave no indication it would change. dr. mari√¢ngela sim√£o, the who's assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals, said that even vaccinated people should continue to consistently wear masks, avoid crowds, and maintain social distance from others, make sure they are in well-ventilated spaces, wash their hands frequently, and avoid sneezing or coughing around other people. ""what we're saying is, 'once you've been fully vaccinated, continue to play it safe, because you could end up as part of a transmission chain.""' said dr. bruce aylward, a senior adviser to the who. new york times australia faces 'critical time' with new covid-19 clusters sydney ‚Äî australia is on the verge of a national coronavirus outbreak just as most other developed economies are emerging from restrictions, with the delta virus variant seeding new clusters across the continent. the highly transmissible variant, first detected in india, is confounding authorities' ability to stay ahead of its spread, even with rigorous contact-tracing and domestic border closures that have allowed the country to remain largely open for most of the pandemic. officials said it is a ""critical time"" for the nation. ""we're entering a new phase of this pandemic, with the more contagious delta strain,"" josh frydenberg, the country's top finance official, said on the australian broadcasting corp. by monday, the country's most populous city, sydney, and its smallest capital, darwin, in the northern territory, were in lockdown. mask mandates were introduced in the federal capital, canberra; in queensland; and in perth, capital of western australia state. victoria, home to melbourne, imposed border restrictions on several of the states. washington post europe toughens curbs on uk visitors to stem variant portugal and spain imposed new restrictions on british visitors monday amid concern about the delta variant as germany pushed for a more coordinated european union response to try to limit the virus taking hold in the bloc. the changes are a setback for europe's holiday destinations just as the summer tourism season should be kicking up a gear. the latest decisions add to the patchwork of confusing, and rapidly changing, rules in place for holiday makers. german chancellor angela merkel has suggested the entire eu should coordinate closely and be more cautious about allowing entry to travelers from external countries. the country already has a ban on most travel from the uk. portugal's latest decision, which takes effect monday, imposes a quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals from britain. other countries, including spain, malta, and hong kong, have also recently announced new rules on arrivals from the uk. bloomberg news"

Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

A protest earlier this month on City Hall Plaza (above) was just one of many that have taken place in Boston and across the country. The Davis Museum (left) removed works of art by immigrants in support of protests against President Trump's immigration policies.
Protesters are busy these days. The election has given so many so much to oppose that Stacey Dogan, a Boston University law professor who cofounded a local resistance group, likened keeping up with it all to a ""second job."" ""Every day you could be going to something different,"" she said. In Boston, a hub of political protest since the election, progressives are packing house parties to brainstorm. They are signing up with sites like SwingLeft.org or Flippable.org to learn about and, they hope, to sway political races in nearby or distant states. They're raising money for groups they see as threatened by President Trump's agenda, and are going to training sessions to learn how to organize. They're getting ""daily action alerts"" on their phones. In Dorchester, a group of newly minted activists eager to help their Vietnamese and Cape Verdean neighbors located volunteers to translate the ACLU's instructions on what to do if immigration agents show up at their door. ""The directions were only in English and Spanish,"" said Erin Carey, a veterinarian who organized a ""huddle"" in Dorchester. Her group is one of 222 huddles statewide, and one of nearly 5,000 across the country that formed in the wake of the Women's March, according to Yordanos Eyoel, a spokeswoman for the Sister March Network. The huddles can be as small as eight people, she said, or as large as one in Orlando, which has more than 350 members. On Commonwealth Avenue, two artists who've been friends since middle school organized 50 fellow artists for a group sale at an all-female tattoo parlor. ""We got this together in two weeks,"" said Amanda Abbott, a tattoo artist at Brilliance Tattoo. ""People are so riled up they want to do something."" The artists sold more than $4,000 of watercolors, ceramics, prints, and jewelry to benefit Greater Boston Legal Services and the Refugee & Immigrant Assistance Center. Abbott wants to hold similar events throughout Trump's presidency. A Brookline huddle is planning to use the Boston Marathon to publicize an anti-Trump message. They're selling T-shirts, hoodies, and hats that read #PERSIST and PERSISTER. Profits will go to The Sister March Network as well as a Marathon charity, said group member Sarah Pagliaccio. The goal is to create a ""wall"" of resistance from Hopkinton to Boston. Although it's been nearly half a century since the country has seen such widespread activism, Ellen Fitzpatrick, a history professor at the University of New Hampshire, says that radical movements are an ""American tradition."" ""Whether it was the suffragists marches in the early 20th century or the huge antiwar marches of the '60s and early '70s, we've seen this before,"" she said. ""Look at the populist movement in the late 19th century, when American farmers started a grassroots movement attempting to challenge the power of big corporate interests and banks,"" she said. ""There were marches of unemployed people who came to Washington during the Depression in the 1890s to protest their situation, and the civil rights movement."" But, Fitzpatrick said, there is a difference this time: The administration's alleged connections to a foreign power that for much of the Cold War was considered an enemy. ""We're in entirely new territory."" Indeed, Tiziana C. Dearing, a Boston College professor and co-director of the school's Center for Social Innovation, says many people have been spurred to action because they feel that Trump poses an ""existential threat."" ""There aren't a lot of formal levers to counter that threat,"" Dearing said. ""And if you don't have formal levers, people take to the streets."" And many of those people include children, as parents fit protest actions into the family schedule, working in resistance in between cello lessons, sports, and homework. Protesting has become such a part of Cambridge writer Katherine Wolff's family routine that when one of her 12-year-old twins heard mom sigh after reading an ""alarming"" story, she knew what to say: ""I guess we might as well leave our [protest] signs by the front door."" The most visible action takes place on the streets, of course. But behind the scenes, people are connecting via social media, through Facebook groups like B Together, a Boston-based Trump resistance group that aims to advance causes that advocate for equality, racial justice, women's rights and more. Despite being private, it has attracted nearly 16,000 members since the election, said spokeswoman Robyn Parets. Members create their own events ‚Äî a group recently made ""pussy hats"" at a ""knit together"" ‚Äî and they also partner with nonprofits that have been advocating for rights even before Trump was elected. While many protestors focus on a single issue ‚Äî the environment, say, or press freedom or reproductive rights ‚Äî others say they are driven by a fear that's larger than any one cause. ""I am the third generation after the Holocaust and we were raised with this great awareness of our history,"" said Anne-Carina Kelly, a German native working to complete a master's degree in political science at Northeastern University. She is frightened by parallels she sees in the rise of Hitler and Trump she said, explaining her volunteer efforts. ""As a German, I can't look away and do nothing.""
