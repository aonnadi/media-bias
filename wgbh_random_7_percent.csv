A bulk package of Crayola crayons.These are some of the items on third-grade teacher Dana Stassen's Amazon wish list, which she uses to crowdsource supplies for her classroom in Kennesaw, Georgia. Even with help, she typically spends more than $1,000 on school supplies, classroom decorations and snacks, she says. But this year, she's trying to spend around $800, although she doesn't know whether that will be possible with inflation.""I'm going to have a ton of out-of-pocket expenses as a classroom teacher to make sure that my students have what they need,"" Stassen said.Many parents are also hoping to pull back on spending on school supplies this year, according to a survey released Wednesday by Deloitte. The firm is predicting that spending will decrease 10% from last year, marking the first decline since 2014, said Stephen Rogers, the managing director of Deloitte's Consumer Industry Center. Inflation is having a big impact on how parents are shopping, he said.""So parents who say they're spending more and parents who say they're spending less, both blame inflation for that,"" Rogers said. ""So that's also a curious place where we find ourselves. Inflation is definitely top of mind for everyone.""Nabbing a $3 shirt and looking for discountsPrices for school supplies have jumped nearly 24% in the last two years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Due to the higher prices, many shoppers this year are focusing more on getting classroom supplies like folders and pencils than they are on new clothes or tech products, Rogers said.Melissa Wright, a parent and former elementary school teacher in Chandler, Ariz., is back-to-school shopping this week before her kids' first day of school next Wednesday. She's aiming to spend under $250 on clothes and supplies for both of her kids.""I use the Target Circle app, so today even for the shirts and stuff I bought my daughter, they were all like 30% off. One of them I looked at rang up like 3 bucks,"" said Wright. ""I do love a sale.""She isn't alone. Most shoppers are planning back-to-school shopping around sales events, according to the National Retail Federation. Deloitte's survey found that 69% of shoppers will look at back-to-school deals on Amazon during its Prime Day event, which started Tuesday and ends Wednesday. But people prefer to shop in person for the majority of their back-to-school shopping.Stassen, however, is relying more heavily on online shopping to prepare for her return to the classroom, as well as to get items for her first-grader and fourth-grader. She works as an assistant director at a Pennsylvania summer camp, and she won't be back home in Georgia until right before school starts on Aug. 1.""Like many parents I know, we're all doing our school supply shopping online as best we can while we're away and just getting things shipped to the house,"" said Stassen.To save money, she also plans to use teacher discounts where offered and visit secondhand stores to maximize her budget.""I definitely try to keep my ear to the street for when those teacher discount days are happening, for my classroom and for my own kids,"" Stassen said.Summer started less than a month ago, but already it's time to shop for schoolThe bulk of back-t0-school shopping will be over before July ends — even though some schools won't open until September. According to Deloitte, 59% of total back-to-school spending is expected to take place in July.Despite financial concerns, some shoppers will still splurge on some items, Rogers said. Wright said she'll probably spend the most money on new shoes and backpacks for her kids. According to the Deloitte survey, parents are most likely to splurge on apparel and tech, with 6 in 10 parents saying they would spend more on higher-quality items or to ""treat their child,"" an experience Rogers shared.""It's something very familiar with me,"" he said. ""I just spent more on my 13-year-old's first cellphone because she wanted a specific brand in purple.""Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters.

They had a front row seat to the brewing operations that led to the eight beers on tap displayed before them. Maureen Fabry, who has been a brewmaster for 22 years, opened Craft Roots Brewing in Milford with her wife, Robin, six years ago. While Maureen enjoys watching people sip the beer she crafted, she prefers the brewing process.""I enjoy the physicality of beer, knowing which malts to use to get the colors and flavors you want, being able to understand different beer styles that have been brewed for centuries and emulating those,” she said.Her business is one of New England's women-owned breweries, a category that industry leaders say is growing more common as the industry becomes more inclusive. Fabry said when she was first starting out in the brewing world, she noticed some hesitation among her male counterparts when they encountered her. ""I think there was some concern about being able to handle the weights of picking up a 50-pound bag or a keg, but that's not really an issue. And there are so many more women now in all aspects of the brewing industry,” she says.Katie Stinchon is executive director of the Massachusetts Brewers Guild, a trade association that protects and promotes the interests of brewers. She says the guild has taken steps to address equity in the craft beer industry. ""We recently purchased Speakfully, which is an anonymous third-party reporting system for all of our members to implement inside their breweries to make sure they're managing their culture. They're ridding their space of any sexism or racism that may exist."" She said 13 breweries have signed up so far. In Holyoke, maltster Andrea Stanley co-owns Valley Malt, the first malt house built in the Northeast in over a century. Stanley, who began as a home brewer and now grows wheat, rye and barley, said beer shouldn't be considered a male-led industry — because women have been brewing beer for at least 12,000 years. ""[Male-led brewing] has been a temporary blip in the screen,"" she said.Stanley is encouraged by seeing more women in the industry, but she acknowledges she has had to fight an uphill battle. ""A lot of times when I go to events, either as a business owner or a consumer, depending on the space that you're in, you don't always feel necessarily that it’s a safe supportive space for women.""Dara Klotz has been brewing beer at Exhibit 'A' Brewing Company in Framingham for a year and a half. She recently demonstrated her craft as part of Pink Boots Collaboration Brew Day, an international celebration of women and non-binary individuals in the fermented and alcoholic beverage industry. Klotz brewed a Hefeweizen for the occasion, a limited-edition beer called Salem's End, a nod to the witches of Salem who were brewers, or ""alewives,"" a term that dates to the 5th century, according to the website Beer and Brewing. ""Women were the original brewers. It was considered one of the tasks of running a home. So, I think that we're reclaiming that,"" Klotz said.Klotz, who began brewing at Exhibit 'A' after 12 years in the restaurant industry, says she feels supported and encouraged by her male colleagues. “I’m the only woman on our production team, but I definitely don't feel that way. It's an equitable team. We work really well together,"" she said.The job finder website Zippia says in 2021 just 11% of all brewers in the U.S. were women. That's a 2% increase from the previous decade. Lora Estey, co-owner of Distraction Brewing in Roslindale, believes the numbers are still relatively low because of a lack of representation. ""Going into an environment where you can work hard and someone is not going to second guess you all the time, that needs to happen before women think of themselves as brewers,"" Estey said.Estey opened Distraction Brewing Company with her husband in an old flat iron building in Roslindale Village that once housed a bank. She says they opened four months before the pandemic hit and as a result, they have pivoted multiple times over the last three years. ""I order everything. I design the T-shirts. I taught myself how to do the labels. The list goes on and on,"" she said.Estey also works full-time as a software engineer, so she's no stranger to gender stereotypes in the workplace. She says the beer industry has been more accepting of her as a woman than the engineering field, yet skepticism from male brewers persists.""Aren't I a customer who orders beer? Don't I understand what a customer would want? Do I not get to have a perspective because I'm female? I mean just little things like that, especially about actual beer,"" Estey said.Estey sees women's interest in beer growing. ""I think if I look at our Instagram feed and followers, I think we're 60 percent women and 40 percent men,"" she said.",Local,"Mon, 15 May 2023 05:00:47 EST",f5dd2c96cf630085ff3e8e91d6fd4b32
1609,Ask Dave Epstein: What's No Mow May?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/26/ask-dave-epstein-whats-no-mow-may,"It's a low-maintenance way to help pollinators, Epstein said.","Meteorologist Dave Epstein is our go-to person for pressing weather questions on everything from winter blizzards to summer droughts. He’s also a horticulturist, meaning he’s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Dave graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity. Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.The idea behind No Mow May is to hold off on mowing lawns during the month of May, letting flowering weeds and other plants grow so pollinators can have an easier time finding flowers early in the season, Epstein said. “It started in the Midwest,” Epstein said. “The caveat here is if you've got all grass and you have one of those perfect lawns that you've been treating with chemicals and there are no pollinating things, then it doesn't matter.”Epstein mentioned creeping Charlie, also called ground ivy, a plant that produces tiny purple flowers that are perfect for spring pollinators. People usually consider it a weed, he said.“It's great for the pollinators but a lot of people are like, 'I don't want this in my lawn, I'm going to rip it out,'” he said. “And so they treat it. And now you've got just blades of grass, and blades of grass aren't good for pollination.”To sum it up: No Mow May has Epstein’s approval. “But you've got to have something to not mow, if that makes sense,” he said.The answer begins in photosynthesis, Epstein said. “One of the byproducts [of photosythesis] is sugar that's being transported from the leaves,” Epstein said. “It gets into the fruit. So the phloem [plant tissue that conducts sugars] is actually carrying the sugars into the fruit.”The sugars do not, in fact, originate in the fruit, Epstein said. But as the fruit ripens, the sugars inside of it are converted into different starches, he said. Because the ends of the fruit ripen first, and because much of the fruit found in local supermarkets is picked before it is fully ripe to preserve it until it can be sold, often only the ends have reached sweet, ripe starchy development. Yes, Epstein said. He uses seaweed in his garden, too. “It's a great way to tamp down weeds,” he said. “So in between my rows, I'll take some seaweed. We have a little cottage up in Maine, and so sometimes when I'm up there, I'll take a bag of seaweed.”There are also seaweed-based fertilizers available, he said. “Now, exactly how much and how you work it in, I would do a little bit more research on,” he said. “I wouldn't put a ton down because, you know, you could put too much of a good thing. But yeah, it's perfectly good in the garden and also great in compost piles.”Dave’s Growing Wisdom Tip: “Whether or not you have a big garden, do some things in containers. This is a great couple of weeks ahead, with cool and relatively damp weather. Lettuces, radishes, turnips, Asian greens, kales — all will be really happy planting in the garden right now.”",Local,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 13:27:41 EST",26ae362cfc60777491646d7dc7a9d438
4011,"Maternity homes provide support in a post-Roe world, but not without conditions",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/09/maternity-homes-provide-support-in-a-post-roe-world-but-not-without-conditions,"Faith still marvels at the turn her life took in just a few months. ""I'm 25 and I have a curfew,"" she says. ""This is so gross. I hate it.""","Faith still marvels at the turn her life took in just a few months. ""I'm 25 and I have a curfew,"" she says. ""This is so gross. I hate it.""NPR is not using Faith's last name for this story. She says her ex-boyfriend emotionally and verbally abused her, and she doesn't want him to know where she is. On this day, she reclines on a couch in the living room of the recently renovated house where she now lives. It's a maternity home. Faith is 20 weeks pregnant.Called the Nesting Place, it's part of a Christian organization in Nampa, Idaho, that tries to dissuade people from abortion and persuade them to take up parenthood. Women can live in the home for free while they carry pregnancies. After their babies are born, they can stay for six months longer.Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the pugilistic state and federal legal battles that have followed have garnered all the attention. But another quieter story has played out for women in life-changing ways as the number of abortions has declined markedly.One group of researchers forecasts 60,000 fewer abortions in the year since abortion became largely illegal in much of the United States. These declines are in the states where pregnant women already faced the greatest risks of maternal mortality and poverty.For the women navigating these dangers, allies are hard to come by. Maternity homes are a rare source of support. They're free — but not without conditions.Faith struggled to accept the rules: phones turned in at night, home by 11 p.m., visitors only in common spaces, clean drug tests, compliance with the program and contributions to the household. Permission to leave overnight — even for just one night — must be earned through good behavior.""Those words were scary to me,"" says Faith. She'd lived on her own for five years before coming here. But she couldn't deny that it was the best option given her circumstances: single, pregnant, little family support, unemployed and homeless.She believed turning down the offer of a place to live would be a mistake. ""I just knew immediately,"" she says. ""I was like, 'I'd be so stupid.'""Pregnancy comes with many costsFaith grew up in Idaho in a family of hunters and sportsmen. But she's a born singer. Her voice is her gift. ""I am very, like — soulful rock,"" she says. ""Gospel worship is, like, a part of me."" Raised Mormon, she left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a teenager and discovered rock 'n' roll and singers like Adele. ""I'm a powerhouse, like belter, type of singer.""She knew she had talent, and neither Idaho nor Colorado, where she moved after high school to live with her sister, was the place to foster it. At 21, Faith packed her car for Los Angeles. She worked there in hospitality at some of the city's most breathtaking high-end hotels. She was the woman behind the front desk. ""I was good at it,"" she says. ""I loved it.""But last year, she met a man, also an aspiring musician, and threw herself into the relationship. Not long after, she says, she was feeling depressed, unsure where her music career was heading.With him, her life unraveled. She lost her apartment. They were soon homeless, bouncing from her car to motels. ""We would book the studio for music time and also sleep there,"" she explains. Her boyfriend told her he was a chef, but she became suspicious. He didn't work much.Faith realized how toxic the relationship was at just about the time she learned she was pregnant. The thought of entanglement with this man forever terrified her. ""My first thought was abortion,"" she says.But something held her back. She'd had an abortion a few years earlier. She still grieved that pregnancy. She felt certain it would have been a girl. She couldn't stop thinking about the child she might have had.""I don't live life with regrets,"" Faith says. ""I take on my choices. This is the one thing that I can't not regret. It's really heavy on my heart a lot of the time.""She called her mom back in Idaho. She recalls her mother saying that ""you can do this"" and that ""we'll figure it out. I think that you'll be a wonderful mom.""""I didn't know that that's what I needed to hear until she told me that.""Faith got rid of half her possessions and flew home. She still remembers the relief she felt that day as she watched LA recede in the distance, out the airplane window.But shortly after she got to Idaho, things began to fall apart there, as well. Her stepfather kicked her out of the house. She had already let keeping the pregnancy take root in her mind. It would be a girl, she thought. The thought of not having a place to bring her baby home to terrified her.That's when she walked into Robin Watters' crisis pregnancy center.Maternity homes are a solution the Christian right can supportBack in 2018, Watters read an article in a Christian publication. It posed a question: ""What would your state do if Roe v. Wade was overturned?"" At the time, that seemed like an outlandish possibility. But it got her thinking. ""Wouldn't a maternity home,"" she says, ""be the perfect answer?""There are more than 400 maternity homes across the U.S., according to the Maternity Housing Coalition, an umbrella advisory group. Many are associated with crisis pregnancy centers and — like the Nesting Place — a Christian ministry.Watters was already running a crisis pregnancy center called Lifeline Pregnancy Care Center when she began dreaming about building a maternity home. She'd seen hundreds of pregnant young women who needed a place to live and, she thought, would benefit from a relationship with the church. She pitched the idea to her board of directors. They went for it, and contractors were finishing renovations on the home that the center had purchased when the Supreme Court issued the decision that overturned Roe. The Nesting Place opened in February.Nampa, a bedroom suburb of Boise, is not a rich community, but Watters says support for this project is broad and deep. To renovate and staff the house, the organization doubled its budget to a half-million dollars annually. It's now working to build an endowment to finance the operation indefinitely without depending on year-to-year donations.Nearby churches are a primary means of financial support. On a recent day, Keith Wagner, an evangelical pastor, stopped by. It was the first time he'd seen the house since its completion. He seemed awed. ""Robin,"" he said, ""This is amazing!""Sitting in the living room minutes later, Wagner said last summer's Supreme Court decision ending the national right to abortion took the Christian right by surprise.""Their position has way too often been only defined by what they're against — 'I'm against abortion.'"" But Wagner says after the court victory, things changed. ""They had to say, 'Oh, hold on a second. OK. We've prayed for this. Now what are we going to do?'""This year, thousands of low-income women and those living in poverty will have babies in Idaho. And more than 7,000 women a year in Idaho are reliant on Medicaid to cover births. The state now has some of the more austere abortion laws in the country. It's the only state where people can be prosecuted and go to prison for helping a minor leave the state to get an abortion.Wagner says he encourages people in his congregation of 4,000 to consider adoption or foster-parenting. But that level of sacrifice isn't something many are ready to make. Supporting an organization like the Nesting Place gives people a way to put money behind words.Even in best-case scenarios, this kind of organization cannot give women all the resources they need for 18 or more years of parenting. ""They chose life,"" Wagner said, ""but it's expensive."" That's why he supports the organization's stated commitment to helping women build financial skills and learn a trade.Even then, people will fall through cracks.Maternity homes don't work for everyoneThings have not worked out for at least one person who came to the Nesting Place. Autumn Hendry, who's 29, found the organization when she was nine weeks pregnant. She says her circumstances felt insurmountable: homeless and struggling with substance abuse. Abortion seemed her best option.But when Hendry met with the staff members at the crisis pregnancy center, they laid out another path: move into the Nesting Place, get clean, have the baby. ""They made me feel really comfortable,"" she said. ""I was able to quit using.""She stopped using methamphetamines and alcohol for a few weeks and earned an overnight pass for good behavior. While she was away from the maternity home visiting a friend, she relapsed.Watters and Nesting Place staff worked to find Hendry in-patient treatment. She enrolled but then left. Now, she's 26 weeks pregnant, unable to stop using and has no place to live.She regrets not having the abortion. ""I don't want to be pregnant anymore,"" she says. ""But it's too late now.""Placing her baby for adoption seems like an obvious path for Hendry. But she has already been down that road. She describes the day several years ago when authorities took her 5-year-old son, Jacob, from school. Child abuse, they said.""The loss was so bad,"" she says. Talking about it is wrenching for her. After Jacob's removal, Hendry says, she ""dove hard into drugs.""She fought to get Jacob back, but after a few years she could see his life was improving in foster care. She made the excruciating decision to sign over her rights. ""I decided it was probably best for him.""When she thinks about adoption and this pregnancy, she relives that trauma.She's couch-surfing now. On a recent day, she was sitting outside a friend's house not sure whether he'd open the door for her.The Maternity Housing Coalition acknowledges that substance abuse is a growing issue for maternity homes like the Nesting Place. But these homes are not typically based on a medical model of recovery or equipped to provide in-patient treatment.""I knew drugs would be in the mix,"" says Watters, the executive director. ""I just didn't know where or how much."" The twin issues of homelessness and substance abuse surprised her. She had imagined clients differently.""I thought it was just like, 'Oh, someone's pregnant, but they have, you know, their parents aren't wanting them to be,'"" says Watters. ""Or they have no friends, or they need a job."" She feels bad for Hendry, but she can't let her come back while she's using drugs. The rules are in place for everyone's safety. ""These are choices she's making,"" she says.Research shows that women with substance use disorders are at greater risk for unplanned pregnancies. And nearly 20% of people who seek abortions are homeless, according to one study.Still, Watters sees Hendry's case as a kind of victory. She persuaded this young woman not to have an abortion. ""The outcomes in this ministry are so hard to see,"" Watters says. ""It can be years later.""Faith forges a new pathFaith stands in the kitchen of the Nesting Place, sorting a pile of paperwork. ""This is what I'm working on now."" She gestures to a paper calendar. The days are filled with activities offered by Christian support groups — one for single moms and another that includes instruction on using Christianity to change behaviors. Recently, she says she has found her way to a new faith.She's hopeful that six months after she has the baby, she'll be eligible for free or reduced housing through a program that helps participants build financial skills. She plans to start massage therapy school in a few weeks.The staff members at the house breeze in and out. This place is staffed 24 hours a day. There are only two pregnant women living here now, but the staff hopes to expand to four soon.Another potential resident, 18-year-old Auna, comes by for an interview and to look around.She is 25 weeks pregnant. There is no turning back now. ""This is happening,"" she says, telling the staff that she'll think about moving in.Auna asks to be identified only by her first name because she hasn't told her school or employer yet. She doesn't want people to know about her situation or that she considered getting an abortion and even made calls about getting an appointment in the neighboring state of Oregon.Ultimately, she decided against it. ""My mom's always raised me to believe that abortion's not OK. I didn't realize how much it stuck with me until I got pregnant."" She's finding out the gender soon, she says with an excited smile. Auna is still in high school.Faith is also feeling excited, among other emotions. She's grappling with what it will mean to be a single mom; she's lonely at times, carrying a pregnancy without a partner.She's also mad. She's not planning to ask her ex-boyfriend for help, afraid of what he might do. It's unfair, she says, how little this situation demands of the father of her child. As far as she knows, he's still in Los Angeles. ""He gets to be there and continue his music journey and do what he's doing.""She's only 25, Faith reminds herself. She imagines someday — maybe four or five years from now — driving back to Los Angeles to resume her dream of singing professionally, this time with her daughter in tow.""I'm just pressing pause right now.""

5945,Gov. Healey unveils $742 million tax relief plan,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/27/gov-healey-unveils-742-million-tax-relief-plan,"Healey’s tax bill has breaks for families, renters and seniors.","Gov. Maura Healey is proposing a $742 million package of tax cuts in the state budget she will file Wednesday, offering relief for parents, renters and seniors alongside other tax reforms. Healey's plan shares common ground with the tax proposal former Gov. Charlie Baker could not get over the finish line his final year in office, and it features some other measures that have been kicking around Beacon Hill for years, like a new live theater tax credit and changes to the way locally produced hard cider is taxed. Announced Monday morning at the Demakes Family YMCA in Lynn, the tax package is centered around a child and family tax credit that Healey touted on the campaign trail. Healey's office said 700,000 taxpayers would benefit from the $600 per-dependent credit, helping them keep up with climbing costs for child and senior care. The child and family tax credit, for children under 13, people with disabilities and senior dependents age 65 and up, combines two interrelated existing benefits — the Household Dependent Tax Credit and Dependent Care Tax Credit — while removing the cap on dependents, and increasing the benefits. At a cost to the state of $458 million for the next budget year, it's the single largest piece of Healey's proposal. Healey said she and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll are filing this package for people ""who are struggling to get by as the cost of living continues to skyrocket past them – the family watching their grocery bill grow each week, the young mom who wants to return to her dream job but can’t afford child care, the recent college graduate who can’t afford both his rent and student loan payments, the seniors who want to keep the home where they raised their family.""Along with the child and family credit, the plan would increase the rental deduction from $3,000 to $4,000, and double to $2,400 a credit for low-income seniors paying property taxes or rent. In a pair of moves Healey described as ways to make Massachusetts more competitive with other states, the bill would use credits to eliminate the estate tax — which currently kicks in at $1 million — for estates valued up to $3 million, and cut the tax rate on short-term capital gains to 5% from 12%Last year, Baker filed a nearly $700 million tax plan that also would have boosted credits for dependent and child care, increased the rental deduction, doubled credits for seniors, reformed the estate tax and cut the short-term capital gains tax. The House and Senate each passed different tax relief bills last year, never agreeing on specifics. Ultimately, legislative leaders shelved the bills after realizing the state would be returning $3 billion in excess revenues to residents, pledging to revisit the issue this year. Senate President Karen Spilka, at the start of the session in January, called for lawmakers to pass progressive tax relief “soon.” Tax policy bills, though, must start in the House, where Speaker Ron Mariano has talked about watching the state’s fiscal picture before acting. Healey’s tax package would also: expand the list of occupations that qualify for apprenticeship tax credits, and double the statewide cap on those credits to $5 million;increase the cap on Housing Development Incentive Program credits, with the goal of producing more market-rate housing in gateway cities;increase the cap to $8 million for the state's dairy tax credit, which Massachusetts Dairy Farmers Association President David Shepard said would ""greatly help offset the forecasted difficult times ahead in dairy costs of production and pricing"";exempt employer assistance with student loan repayment from taxable income;expand tax-deductible commuter transit benefits to include regional transit passes and bike commuter expenses;double the credit for lead paint abatement, and double the maximum credit for septic tank repair or replacement in a primary residence, and;extend the expiring brownfields tax credit for cleanup of contaminated properties through 2028.",Politics,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 09:30:46 EST",72f6265e910dba08031d11a15ddfb268

We love to have on local experts and future leaders to celebrate their accomplishments, but what’s especially awesome about this guest is that he’s just 10 years old. Meet Tanoshi Inomata, a fourth grader who just won the Boston spelling bee and will be heading to Washington, D.C., for the national spelling bee in May. Tanoshi and his parents, Hiromi and Chikao, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to spell out his victory.Arun Rath: Tanoshi, you must have studied very hard for this. Tell us how you felt when you realized you were the winner.Tanoshi Inomata: I was surprised that I was the big champion because even though I practice a lot every day, I never thought I could. Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn’t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them. Rath: Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi: My championship word was ‘ancho.’ Rath: How do you spell that?Tanoshi: You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath: I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi: It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers. Rath: Oh, right! That’s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right? What was your sense of it?Tanoshi: I was pretty confident because even though when I first practiced, I got it wrong. But then I started practicing it and I got it right.Rath: That’s brilliant. Congratulations!Tanoshi: Thank you.Rath: I didn’t realize this, but apparently, only one other person from Massachusetts has won the national spelling bee. That was over 80 years ago. How do you feel about it?Tanoshi: I feel like now I want to win the national spelling bee and show off to everyone.Rath: Are you feeling confident?Tanoshi: Yeah. Now I’m practicing two times a day. I’m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath: Tanoshi, I’m curious, what’s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi: Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath: And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi: Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It’s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he’ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I’m sure I’ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi: Me, too!Rath: It sounds like you have a good time together. That’s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi: I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year. Rath: Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: That’s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.? Tanoshi: Yeah. And I’m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath: So you’ll be heading to Washington in May. Are you going to be practicing every day between now and then?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Do you have a favorite word to spell?Tanoshi: I like to spell long words. For example, tintinnabulary. Rath: Tintinnabulary has to do with a ringing of bells?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Can you spell that out for me, if you don’t mind showing off?Tanoshi: T-I-N-T-I-N-N-A-B-U-L-A-R-Y. Tintinnabulary. Rath: Brilliant. We’re so happy that you’re going to nationals and representing us. Good luck! We can’t wait to hear how it goes. Tanoshi: Oh, actually, I have one more thing.

4922,"How the MLB is trying to solve slow, boring baseball games",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/06/how-the-mlb-is-trying-to-solve-slow-boring-baseball-games,"Bigger bases, a pitch clock and banning the shift are just a couple of the changes coming this season, The Athletic's Jen McCaffrey explains.","It’s (probably) the reason you can’t convince your friend to go to a baseball game: America’s favorite pastime is just too slow for some people. Now, Major League Baseball is taking that complaint to heart. New rules for the new season are designed to help speed up the game, among a slew of changes that even casual fans can expect to notice on the field. Jen McCaffrey, who covers the Red Sox for The Athletic, joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to discuss what's already been different as spring training gets underway. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So before we get into these new rules, can we talk a bit about how baseball has gotten slow and why it's so slow? They actually have gotten slower compared to, say, the '80s? Jen McCaffrey: Oh, absolutely. Back even in the early '90s, games were at a more decent pace. Two and a half hours was kind of what you expected when you were watching a game. And within the past 15 to 20 years, maybe since 2000 or so, the game has slowed to it to a halt where three, three and a half hours is not out of the norm for a game at Fenway. And it's just not acceptable for fans who want to get in and out. You can also compare them to other sports that are much faster-paced. So I think baseball finally realized, and it took a while. These rules have been implemented this spring and are going to be implemented throughout this season. And so far in these spring training games, it's really quickened up the pace. The games are closer to about two and a half hours. So I think we'll see a big change throughout the season here. Siegel: One of the biggest changes is introducing the pitch clock. It sets several limitations on both the pitcher and the batter in an effort to speed up each player's at bat. What can people exactly expect to see from that? McCaffrey: It's not going to sound like much, but pitchers have 15 seconds with no runners on base, and 20 seconds when runners are on base. And that time frame doesn't sound like a lot. But you know, everybody's looking for a competitive advantage in this game. So pitchers sometimes will stand on the mound, step off. The batter will take a time out, the pitcher will take a time out. There's been restrictions put in place where the pitcher basically has to get the ball and throw it. One of the pitchers the Red Sox signed this winter, Kenley Jansen, was the slowest pitcher in the league last year in terms of throwing the ball. So he really worked this winter to quicken up his pace, and it's very noticeable. The pitch clock is going to make a huge difference. The casual fan who maybe tunes in to a handful of games a year is actually going to really notice a quickened pace and not as much lag time and not as much of the boringness that the game has gotten of late. And that's what baseball is looking to implement. Siegel: So on top of what happens on the field and what happens in-person at games, you know, obviously baseball games are broadcast on TV. Does the broadcast of commercial breaks specifically influence the timing at all? Is that at all to blame for how slow things have gotten? McCaffrey: You know, a little bit. But one of the bigger changes this year is what a lot of teams are going to be wearing. You've seen in soccer, some people might be familiar with advertisements on the actual jerseys. The Red Sox actually have MassMutual, a huge sponsor this year, to have a patch on their jersey for the first time. So you'd see advertisements blowing up. Obviously, it's a billion-dollar league so that's a very influential part of the game. Not as much in baseball — you have the commercial breaks in between innings — but it'll still factor in. And I'm sure people that pay a little bit closer attention might notice that patch on the sleeve of the jersey. It's not too distracting. But obviously, money talks. And so any of these teams are going to try to get money any way they can. And obviously they took the opportunity here. Siegel: So another change coming to baseball is the size of the bases. They've gotten bigger. There have been some altered images, showing an exaggerated size difference, shared making it seem like nearly double the size. How much bigger are they really, and what's the point of this? McCaffrey: They're about four inches bigger, which does sound like a lot. And Alex Cora, the Red Sox manager, joked in spring training they look like pizza boxes. They're not quite that big. In addition to speeding up the game, the game just got, again, boring because teams are looking for competitive advantages. So there was a lot of shifting of players around the infield, to take away from base hits and reduce offense, and offense is what people like to see. I mean, sometimes it's exciting to watch pitchers dueling it out and it being a 0-0 game, and there's kind of high drama in that. But I think for the most part, especially a casual fan, wants to see the home runs and wants to see the stolen bases. So by making the bases bigger, it makes it obviously easier for a faster player to reach the base because it's a little bit bigger. And again, when you're thinking about it, you're not thinking a couple of inches is going to matter, but it really does when you come down to these high-level athletes that have been training with the same-size bases for a number of years — or their whole life, really. And having that kind of small advantage, they think, is really going to add a little bit more offense, a little bit more speed to the game, and a little bit more excitement, too. Siegel: Another rule change coming is the ban on teams using a defensive shift. I am not a huge baseball person. My knowledge ended at the end of my sentence there. Can you explain this to me, and what's changing? McCaffrey: Sure. So basically the simplest way to put it is, again: teams are looking for those competitive advantages. So they'll shift players. There's four players on the infield. Normally, those guys are at their set positions, but teams will shift those players so they have, maybe, three players on the right side. If the batter typically hits the ball to that side, they'll kind of shift the players over to that side of the field to try to have more defenders to get to the ball quicker. That was always legal up until this year, and it was sort of something that teams realized they could do maybe around the mid-2000s. It was something the Tampa Bay Rays actually started doing and then other teams picked up on it. It became pretty prevalent throughout the league, but it took away from a lot of base hits. You know, David Ortiz was shifted on a lot. When he would hit a single that was headed towards right field, it would get picked up by the second baseman because there'd be three guys on that side of the field. Teams can't do that anymore on the infield because, again, the league wants to try to promote some more base hits here. So they're trying to make it a little bit more offensive-friendly, a little quicker, and try to just liven up the game a little bit. And it's something you might notice throughout the season, that teams aren't doing anymore — because they can't.",Local,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 14:00:55 EST",1e1be2155b55697bbc63f8d2f961a99c
354,Everything you need to know about the 2023 Boston Marathon,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2023-boston-marathon,"On April 17, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square.","Here’s what you need to know about the 127th Boston Marathon, one of the city’s more-than-a-century-old traditions that brings world-class athletes, an air of excitement and standstill traffic to Greater Boston. When is the marathon? How long has it taken place?This year’s Boston Marathon is on Monday, April 17, 2023.The Boston Marathon is the oldest continually run marathon in the world, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year. This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots’ Day — the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots’ Day. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects for One Boston Day.What is the marathon route?The 26.2-mile route starts in Hopkinton and makes its way through suburbs, all the way to the finish line in Boston. Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners. After setting off along East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle and takes Beacon Street into Brookline, then through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square. How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating a certain time at another major marathon, a time that’s determined by their gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don’t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September. The other way to run the marathon is as part of the charity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who’s running the Boston Marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the “fastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.” The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men’s side are: Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who’s taking on Boston for the first time after winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men’s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women’s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia’s Atsede Baysa. The women’s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland’s Manuela Schär, who has won Boston four times; Australia’s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times. The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year. How much money do athletes win?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made this year?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes. ""So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,"" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the “The Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,” told GBH News when the policy was announced in September. ""I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work … this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.""In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allow pregnant and postpartum runners who qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. “Women who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,” said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA. Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively.Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. If you’re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square.If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. For more details on watching in person, check out the BAA’s spectator guide.What other events will be happening that weekend? The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay. April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m.",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 05:00:10 EST",97792f7e96212ea7be5a9bead7c158fe
4858,Corporate ownership left gaps in community journalism. Meet the people working to fill it.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/13/corporate-ownership-left-gaps-in-community-journalism-meet-the-people-working-to-fill-it,"From part-timers to veteran reporters, they're stepping in.","Jobs cuts and consolidation have local news — especially newspapers — in crisis across the country and here in Massachusetts. It's a problem for communities that lose news coverage.But there’s a side of the story that is less-covered: The people who see the news gap and are doing everything they can for their communities to fill it.One of them is Nicci Kadilak, founder of the Burlington Buzz, an online publication that covers local government and current events in Burlington. Kadilak came up with the idea about a year ago, during local elections.“What I noticed was a couple things,” she said. “One: the turnout was terrible. But also, a lot of people don’t have any idea what goes on in local government.”She saw an opportunity to learn more about what happens in local government and share her learnings with her community.“I started it by writing Facebook posts every day, and sharing them with local resident Facebook groups,” Kadilak said. “And people liked them so much that I decided to turn it into an everyday thing.”Kadilak writes the Burlington Buzz on top of her day job in education, caring for her kids at home and self-publishing a novel. In a community that’s seen its paper consolidated into regional coverage by Gannett, the nation’s largest newspaper chain by circulation, she says it’s necessary.“It’s important for people to know who their neighbors are, to know who’s representing them at the local level and at the state level, to know what kind of voice they have,” Kadilak said. “It’s also important for people to get together and realize they do actually have what it takes to be involved, and why it’s important to them.”Since launching the Buzz, Kadilak has seen her subscriber base grow significantly, and she says she made some money off of it, and will occasionally get recognized around town. Being a journalist is new to Kadilak, but there are other people who’ve been in it for decades also venturing into the local news frontier — like Susan Petroni.When I meet Petroni, who launched the Framingham Source, at a coffee shop in Framingham she was busy breaking news on her gold Macbook, a familiar routine. “I’ve been a journalist since I was 16. Now, we’re going on four decades,” Petroni said. Her first layoff came when she was 22, at her first job as a journalist. “When I got laid off for the fifth time, when I turned just about 50, I decided to launch my own news site,” she said. “I had been in the business for years and I just decided that corporate journalism wasn’t really working for me.”So in 2016, she launched the Framingham Source.“Framingham Source is basically a one-woman newsroom,” she said. “I do have interns during some semesters. But I basically cover everything in the community, from the schools to the businesses to community events to high school sports to college sports to city council meetings. I’m basically out 24/7, 365 days a year.”Petroni has been successful in her online venture — though she notes that work is nonstop. Residents are grateful to have a local news source in their community, she said. Over on the North Shore, Marblehead, a town of about 20,000 people, became the home of three new journalism upstarts.One of them, the Marblehead Beacon, was founded by three residents with no former journalism experience including a high school senior, Jared Lederman. “The Beacon is sort of a culmination of a lot of different things I’m interested in,” said Lederman, the Beacon’s founding editor and web designer. “There’s the business side of things, which is actually what I’m going to be studying in college. There’s the writing piece. And there’s the technology piece, that’s another thing I’ve always been interested in.” Lederman said he hopes the news organization can serve as a beacon of hope in the dark local journalism landscape. “As far as the future of journalism, I’d say as much as possible, I’d like to see it run by people like us: People who are members of a town and really have a vested interest in the well-being of that town, because it removes any true profit motive from the equation,” he said. “It makes it so that we’re truly dedicated to the town, and making sure that people of the town, who we’re friends with and who are our colleagues, are getting the information they deserve.”Northeastern journalism professor Dan Kennedy says these new, hyperlocal organizations represent a shift in the right direction for journalism — but an unequal one.“We’ve seen a lot of this in the affluent suburbs around Boston,” Kennedy said. “We’re seeing less of it in some of the medium-sized cities around Boston that aren’t quite as affluent.”That can be a problem for communities of color that have lost — or historically lacked — coverage, Kennedy said. But it’s a void that some outlets are working to fill. Ron Bell, is a broadcaster at Boston Black News, which started as a nonprofit internet and satellite radio station in 2010 and has since expanded to include an FM station, covering current events for the Black community.“Many of our community members do not know who their elected officials are. So we interview them, they get to know who they are, so they can make educated decisions at the polling locations,” Bell said. “I think a lot of people do not trust their local news. And people trust us.”Another independently-owned local outlet that has defied the odds: The Bay State Banner, a Black-owned local newspaper which recently saw a passing of the torch to new owners, but local ones, not a big conglomerate like Gannet — a move that Kennedy says is also cause for optimism.“I’m very hopeful about the future for local journalism,” Kennedy said. “That said, local news outlets are closing at a much faster rate than new ones are opening.”",Local,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 05:00:13 EST",58e48d232ef0bfc6e16b42eb8318c2be
6853,How a UPS strike could disrupt deliveries and roil the package delivery business,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/12/how-a-ups-strike-could-disrupt-deliveries-and-roil-the-package-delivery-business,"Contract negotiations between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters union stalled last week, heightening the odds of a UPS strike in early August — as well as shake-ups in an increasingly competitive package delivery market.","Contract negotiations between United Parcel Service and the Teamsters union stalled last week, heightening the odds of a UPS strike in early August — as well as shake-ups in an increasingly competitive package delivery market.A nationwide walkout by 340,000 UPS workers would be the largest strike against a single employer in U.S. history, and the first at UPS since 1997. Consumers and industries across the country could see significant disruptions to package deliveries.The package delivery industry has become more competitive since the 1997 UPS work stoppage, which lasted 15 days and cost the company $850 million. UPS is now more vulnerable than before to losing a portion of its business in the event of a strike.In 2021, UPS had 37% of the parcel delivery market by revenue, followed by FedEx at 33%, the U.S. Postal Service at 17% and Amazon Logistics at 12%, according to data from the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index.But analysts say UPS' competitors won't be able to absorb all the backlog created by a strike. UPS delivered an average of 24.3 million packages per day in 2022 — more than any competitor can take on.""In the event of a market disruption, no carrier can absorb all UPS volume,"" FedEx executives wrote in a July 6 internal company memo reviewed by NPR.FedEx is urging shippers to ""begin shipping with FedEx now,"" according to the memo.""As customers are inquiring about available capacity at FedEx, we have been really clear that, yes, of course, we would entertain any good business, and we'd love to talk to them,"" said Brie Carere, chief customer officer at FedEx, during a company earnings call in March.Seeking advantages from strike fearsJeremy Tancredi, who leads the supply chain team at consulting firm West Monroe, said encouraging customers to switch to FedEx early — before a strike happens — is a ""great sales ploy.""He said FedEx is trying to attract more shipping customers by leveraging fears of a possible UPS strike.""As this impending strike gets closer, you'll see customers start to panic a little more,"" Tancredi said. ""And you'll see, in the next two weeks, them starting to shift a lot of that volume over to FedEx.""Tancredi said the U.S. Postal Service could also take on some of UPS' volume, since the agency is already built to handle package delivery. Amazon, he added, could also pick up volume through its own delivery network.UPS wants to keep major customers closeUSPS spokesperson Dave Partenheimer said the U.S. Postal Service has the capacity to ""deliver what is tendered to us.""UPS is taking note of the potential to lose customers to rivals. Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé said during an earnings call in April that UPS has assigned 127 ""high-impact executives"" to update major customers on ""our ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters and to keep them with us.""Even if UPS were to lose some market share leading up to and during a strike, Tancredi predicts the impacts would be temporary. He said most shipping customers would ultimately go back to UPS, partly due to familiarity with the company and its delivery system.But Tommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at consulting firm Insight Sourcing Group, said many UPS customers would likely shift to a more diverse carrier set, keeping a higher percentage of their volume with other carriers to protect their business from future disruptions.UPS ""might lose some people completely outright, but I think more than often, you'd see that they try to put a little more volume with an alternate carrier moving forward,"" Storch said.Contract negotiations at a standstillNegotiations between UPS and the Teamsters union came to a halt last week, in large part due to conditions for the company's part-time workers. Fifty-five percent of Teamsters-represented UPS employees work part time, according to UPS spokesperson Jim Mayer.UPS posted an adjusted profit of nearly $14 billion in 2022. The Teamsters union points to the company's financial gains as evidence that it can — and should — increase workers' wages.""These part-timers are working at poverty wages,"" Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien said on Morning Edition last week. ""They need to drive the starting wage rate up, reward the people that have been there a long time, and provide full-time opportunity for these folks.""UPS workers voted 97% in favor of strike authorization in June. Workers across the country are now holding practice picket lines, in preparation for a strike if UPS and the Teamsters don't agree on a new contract by the July 31 deadline.The negotiations have already yielded several union wins. These include a heat safety agreement that will guarantee air conditioning in new delivery vehicles and the elimination of a two-tier wage system among drivers.UPS is alleging that the union walked away from the bargaining table last week, while Teamsters is placing the blame on the company for failing to meet the union's economic demands.A strike would likely mean package delays for consumers across the country.Along with ordinary Americans not receiving electronics and household goods, major industries — like hospitals reliant on medical devices shipped through parcel carriers — could see significant disruptions.Jason Miller, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, said a strike at UPS would have been far more catastrophic for industries in 2021, when parcel carriers had no extra capacity due to a pandemic-era spike in demand.Activity in the couriers and messengers industry is down 10% to 15% from two years ago, but employment in the sector is substantially higher, Miller said.""Consumers should be very happy this conversation is happening now and not in 2021,"" Miller said.

And with that, so did the C's chances of making history as the first team in the NBA to win a series after being down three games to nothing. GBH's Esteban Bustillos was at the game and joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about it on Tuesday morning. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So first off, before we get into everything that went wrong, there were quite a few celebrity sightings last night. There were a bunch of former Celtics. Esteban Bustillos: Yeah, there were. Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, I think I saw a couple more. Paris Alston: Trying to bring some of that '08 championship magic into the building. Bustillos: For as big of the comparisons about the '04 Red Sox were, there were not as many as I thought. They had Kevin Millar on video, I don't know if he was there in person. So that that was a little odd.Siegel: I also saw Donnie Wahlberg was there, 21 Savage, Aly Raisman, the Olympic gymnast. Before we do get into the game itself, being there in the company of all of these people, what was it like inside of the Garden, before things even got started?Bustillos: The energy was high. The energy was super high. As I mentioned about the '04 Red Sox comparisons, pre-game they had a hype video with a montage of some of the best moments from the '04 ALCS. Paul Pierce was just on the court, just impromptu hyping the crowd up. I mean, this was 30 minutes before the game. The whole place was hyped and then the game started. Alston: And what happened from there? Bustillos: It was really just the first possession. Jayson Tatum went up for a layup, drew contact with Miami's Gabe Vincent. He came down on his foot. Now, anyone who knows, who's ever played basketball, knows that when your foot lands on their player's foot, that's it. That's a graveyard for healthy ankles. And he just immediately was down in pain. There was a nervous murmur that spread throughout TD Garden. He did a pretty good job, I would say, of disguising that pain, but he just wasn't himself for the rest of the night. And Boston's groove was thrown off. Afterwards, Tatum walked with a limp in the press room. Jayson Tatum [previously recorded]: It, you know, kind of impacted me. The rest of the night it swelled up and it was just frustrating. And I was kind of like a shell of myself. It's tough to move. Siegel: So I didn't stay up to watch the game because Paris and I are on the air super early here. Paris actually did watch, which maybe she's regretting. So I've heard a little bit about this game. I mean, I know losing Tatum was big, but Boston only trailed by ten going into the fourth quarter. So what happened there? Bustillos: Yeah. So given the situation they were in with their best player essentially playing on one leg, Boston did a pretty good job of putting up a fight through three quarters. They actually outscored Miami 25-to-24 in that third quarter. The start of the fourth, though, Miami went on a 7-0 run, Boston was down 17, and that's just too hard of a hole to come out of. Boston, they played in hot spurts throughout the game, but Miami consistently hit shots, especially from three-point range, where they were 14 of 28, the Celtics were 9 of 42 from three. Boston would sometimes rush shots, they would look flustered on offense, and the offense just wasn't there. Jaylen Brown, who we're going to talk about a lot, he was 8 of 23 from the field for just 19 points and he just had a bad night when Boston needed him the most with Jayson Tatum, basically, again, just playing on one foot. Jaylen Brown [previously recorded]: You know, my team turned to me to make plays and etc., and I came up short. I failed. And it's tough. You know, I give credit to Miami, but just a terrible job. Alston: So there's no question here that the Celtics lost a key link in the chain with Jayson Tatum and the ankle injury. And I think there's a lot of speculation about how if only that hadn't happened. But at the same time, we've got to remember that Boston was clawing itself out of a 3-0 hole running into this game. So you're having to give 110% for four games in a row. So how much of this is that part of it? Bustillos: I mean, it's definitely part of it, right? There's a reason the Celtics were only the fourth team in NBA history to even be in that position, coming down from 3-0 to tie up the series. But, you know, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have to be perfect or where your health has to be perfect, to when you want to give yourself a little bit of room for error. And being 3-0, there is no more room for error. Al Horford said that they kind of had to play with desperation in the series after falling down the way they did. Al Horford [previously recorded]: There's a lot that goes into it physically, emotionally. There's a lot that goes into it and you get to this point and you still have to play another game. You still have to win another game. And trust me, every guy in the locker room, we wanted it really, really bad. And, you know, it's tough. But as hard as it is, you know, we have to learn from this. Siegel: Let's talk a little bit about learning from this, because going into the season, the C's were favored by a lot of people to make another run at the championship after getting to the finals last year. Where do they go from here? Bustillos: I think one of the big questions is what do they do with Jaylen Brown? He's going to be owed a supermax contract because he made an All-NBA team that would be up to $295 million. That's a lot of money. Will the Celtics want to pay that? Will they want to trade him? For people who want to trade him, my question would be, are you really ready to break up one of the best duos in the NBA with Tatum and Brown over the course of these past few years, even with how his season, especially at the end, went? Alston: So lastly here, Esteban, we've got to talk about Joe Mazzulla, because he obviously was the coach here. But he was sort of thrown into this position because of what happened with former coach Ime Udoka. And I think there's been a lot of questions about whether he rose to the occasion.Bustillos: I would say there is that question, are they going to keep him? My question would be, again, to your point, he's learned a lot. He was put in a bad position. Can he learn from these mistakes going forward? And if you go and get a new coach, is that going to fix all your problems? That would be the fourth coach for the Celtics in four years. That's just not something that most franchises that are looking to win a championship would do. They need to find some consistency. Siegel: Esteban, before we officially say goodbye, Nuggets or Heat?Bustillos: Nuggets in six.Alston: And get some dipping sauce.",Local,"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:47:22 EST",773b1ce4b7ae4ac6e3cc32fa6fb8e1cd
4129,Boston rent control opposition deepens with landlords’ lawsuit,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/28/boston-rent-control-opposition-deepens-with-landlords-lawsuit,MassLandlords’ suit hones in on into big developers’ influence in the Wu administration’s rent control task force.,"MassLandlords, the nonprofit trade association that represents approximately 2,400 landlords across Greater Boston, is charging that Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s rent control proposal protects larger, corporate housing operators. “This rent control proposal could have gone any number of ways, but to us as small landlords, it seems to be the result of developer lobbying,” said Douglas Quattrochi, MassLandlords’ executive director. He stopped short of outrightly accusing the mayor of cronyism but noted that several members of the committee that helped craft Wu’s proposal were contributors to at least one of her political campaigns. The trade group’s newly filed lawsuit seeks to force the city to dilvulge documents that show how the members of the mayor’s Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee were selected. “We actually asked a year ago to find out why MassLandlords and other landlord organizations weren’t invited to the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee. ... We got rejected in our records request,” Quattrochi said. “But, then once the proposal came out, a whole bunch of warning bells started to go off because we looked at who was on the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee and, in terms of campaign dollars donated, it's all developers. And you look at who's exempted under the rent control proposal and it's developers.“So we're trying to find out and we're trying to show if lobbying was at play here in the creation of this rent control proposal,” he said. “It seems like it’s going to benefit developers more than landlords and renters.”“The public has an interest in knowing what communications passed between [the city of Boston] and who became members of the committee, how the Mayor came to choose those particular individuals, and what motivation may exist for them to persist in advocating for policies know to economists and to the general public to be harmful and contrary to the public interest,” a portion of the legal complaint reads.Quattrochi noted that MassLandlords, which is based in Cambridge, was not invited to take part in the proposal’s crafting. Less than 5% of MassLandlords’ members reside in Boston. An even smaller portion operate housing within the city. Wu is seeking to set up a local rent control option for Boston, despite the policy being banned by statewide referendum in 1994. It would require approval from Boston City Council, the state Legislature and the governor to become law.The mayor’s proposal, now before the City Council, would restrict yearly rent increases to a maximum of 10% in high inflation years and the rate of inflation plus 6% in average years. Wu’s exemptions include: a 15-year shield for both new and past construction starting from the year the building’s certificate of occupancy was issued, and another for landlords who own six units or less and live on site with their tenants. Quattrochi said these exemptions leave out a large swath of landlords that could still reasonably be considered small and would be unfairly burdened. “If [the mayor] had actually talked to us, or invited us to sit on the committee, she would’ve heard immediately that there are so many of our members who live across the street from their properties or in the same neighborhood around the corner from [them], but they’re not in their properties,” he said.Wu’s proposal also calls for a rent control board or administrator to oversee local rent regulation. Quattrochi said that could create problems for small landlords who may end up needing to ask for permission to make certain improvements to their properties as they did under past rent control regulations while developers enjoy an extended exemption. Stakeholders across Greater Boston’s development sector are now publicly speaking out against Wu’s effort. The Greater Boston Real Estate launched a $400,000 campaign against rent control this month. The mayor has dismissed criticism of her proposal, insisting that it is the balanced approach necessary to allow stability for both housing operators and renters.While appearing on WBUR’s “Radio Boston” earlier this week, Wu expressed confidence that the transparency concerns raised in the lawsuit will be “sorted out,” and said, “many of the special interest groups who might be either listening to fearmongering or practicing fearmongering here really are just trying to stop a policy that that people are scared of.” “Whether it’s a group that is trying to put a lawsuit forward to just add more news and make sure that there’s as much potential delay in the process as possible, to others who are putting money behind an effort to put a message out there that this is taking us backwards, or assert that City Hall can’t do math or this or that — this is a different proposal that we’re putting forward now compared to what used to exist in Massachusetts and in many places decades ago, or even in some of the cities that are being brought up as examples of what to avoid,” Wu said.Quattrochi insisted the trade group will see the records request through.“If there were something in the emails, I think it would just further discredit the mayor’s proposal,” he said. “I think this rent control thing is just some incomprehensible distraction at best, and I'm worried that it’s actually been a lobbying effort of nonprofit and for-profit developers here. ... Whatever we find, we’re going to continue to look into this.” Last March, the group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain “any and all City of Boston emails to, from, or cc’ing” advisory committee members for the year before Wu announced them, according to the lawsuit filed late last week. The administration, after prodding from the state, only returned a welcome email dated the day after Wu publicly announced advisory committee members and a response stating that invitations to the committee were given through phone calls. “The implication that in the period March 2021 to March 2022 there were absolutely no email communications between any City department and any of the individuals who went on to become members of the Mayor’s Rent Stabilization Committee struck [MassLandlords] as not credible,” the lawsuit said.The filing goes on to decry rent control as a policy that will cause “availability discrimination,” a phenomenon where landlords hold properties vacant in order to select tenants with good credit scores and high income. MassLandlords’ legal complaint also implied a connection between the advisory committee members and contributions to various campaigns for public office. Seventeen of the 25 members put money toward “Massachusetts political races,” the lawsuit alleges.The group, Quattrochi said, is opposed to rent control in all forms, but would support a “Chapter 40P” program — named for the state law rent control carveout that allows cities and towns to enact rent control and pay landlords the difference between market rent rates and controlled rents.",Politics,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:53:23 EST",bcd5d39a9863d85dfe7c43bee91a0b08

The U.S. Department of Transportation says roadway fatalities are on the rise again after years of decline, with more than 42,000 people killed in both 2021 and 2022 — levels transportation secretary Pete Buttegieg says represent “a national crisis.” The casualties include cyclists and pedestrians as well as drivers, and the former groups are especially vulnerable. According to a new report from WalkMassachusetts, at least 101 pedestrians were killed in the state just last year, with older people and residents of poorer neighborhoods and communities of color being disproportionately affected.Those grim numbers are the backdrop for a new push by the city of Boston to make its streets safer by deploying speed bumps, redesigning problem intersections, and revamping the use of traffic signals. Could Boston’s plan serve as a model for other communities? And what could state government be doing to decrease fatalities?

Faneuil Hall is named for Peter Faneuil, who the city’s own website says “was personally responsible for trafficking African captives to Boston where they were enslaved.”Faneuil Hall, which opened in 1742, is one of Boston’s most visited tourist sites. It is known as a colonial marketplace as well as a gathering hall for speeches and strategy sessions among colonial activists agitating for liberation from England.“As revolutionaries, abolitionists, suffragists, and modern-day activists adopted Faneuil Hall as the site of their speeches, protests, and celebrations, the memory of a generous man slowly replaced the reality of a successful merchant with strong connections to slavery,” the National Park Service now admits.Faneuil was one of colonial Boston’s wealthiest men, a fortune built on an Atlantic shipping business that was intimately tied to the slave trade. Faneuil built his empire transporting enslaved people and the products they harvested, such as sugar and molasses produced by enslaved workers and low-grade cod shipped from New England to the West Indies to feed enslaved plantation workers. His wealth allowed Faneuil to keep several enslaved people in his household and to build the hall as a gift to Boston.Faneuil Hall became both a marketplace and a public gathering place that for years continued to support the slave trade. Boston has excavated all varieties of commercial canisters from under the hall that were manufactured by enslaved people to carry goods produced by their labor. Enslaved people also were bought and sold in the marketplace outside Faneuil Hall.Peter Faneuil is buried in a large tomb at the Granary Burial Ground, a few steps away from John Hancock. No mention is made there of the source of his wealth.SeparatorThis story is part of the project Enslavement History of the Freedom Trail, a collaborative effort between GBH News and Boston University students to detail the mostly hidden history behind some of Boston's most well-known sites.",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 05:00:41 EST",55e2013b55a8a20b14c3da8cd2a2de3d
6002,REFORM Alliance’s fight against the ‘trapdoor’ of probation and parole,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/20/reform-alliances-fight-against-the-trapdoor-of-probation-and-parole,"Born out of Meek Mill’s incarceration for popping a wheelie, the nonprofit has pushed through legislation in nine states.","Out of six million people in the U.S. criminal justice system, nearly four million of them are on probation or parole. And the impact of such a rampant practice is clear. “In any given state, you'll find about a quarter of the prison population are folks that have been sent to prison while on probation or parole, largely for a technical violation. Like speeding, or staying out past curfew, or going to a neighboring city, town or state,” Robert Rooks, CEO of REFORM Alliance said on Boston Public Radio on Thursday. Rooks shared the story of his nephew from Philadelphia, who was on probation but had a job in New Jersey. He had to quit because his probation officer prevented him from traveling out of state.“Those are the types of decisions that people on probation, parole often have to face. It's just not fair. It's not connected or related to why they're on probation or parole. It's not real accountability. And we've been working to change this all across the country.”Established in 2019, the REFORM Alliance has passed 16 bills in nine different states to change the way probation and parole works in the criminal justice system — states that range from Florida to Louisiana to California.“We are headed to Illinois in two weeks to pass our 17th piece of legislation. Our goal is to reform — transform — our nation's probation and parole system, to be one that moves away from its current trapdoor: from community to prison back to community,” Rooks said. According to Rooks, research indicates that prolonged periods of probation and parole hinder individuals' ability to reintegrate successfully into society. “Just imagine ... you’re out on probation or parole. You have a probation officer that you have to meet with, say, two days a week. ... Meet with your probation officer for an hour. And then you have an education course, sometimes drug education, sometimes it’s another thematic course you have to take for an hour. And then you have curfew at 6 or 6:30,” he said. “Where is someone to work? Where are you able to earn a living?” To address this issue, Rooks and others have been working on removing unnecessary barriers in states like Pennsylvania. Their efforts incentivize going to work or school to shorten the supervision period.“If you're on probation and you're enrolled in school, college or some kind of education program, you get credit to work time off of your probation. If you were working, you would get work credits to work time off of your probation,” he said. The REFORM Alliance was born after artist Meek Mill was reincarcerated for popping wheelies while he was on probation in 2017. A judge found out and sentenced him to two to four years in prison. This spurred the #FreeMeekMill Movement on social media.“It wasn't easy,” Rooks said. “Took six months to get him out. But when he got out, through his credit, [Meek] said, ‘This is not about me. It's about the millions of people on probation and parole all across this country that are free but not free’,”Rooks said. He credits Meek Mill for bringing attention to the issue of probation and parole. “I've been doing this work for 25 years,” Rooks said. “I've worked on sentencing reform. I worked on the death penalty. I worked on the war on drugs. This issue of probation and parole was seen as so technical that many folks in the field just missed. And he brought attention to it, and REFORM was born.” Meek Mill will be part of a panel at the NAACP’s 114th National Convention hosted in Boston, as well as Robert Kraft, who is a founding partner of REFORM and sits on the board. Rook expressed deep admiration for Kraft and how his involvement helps REFORM’s reputation, saying that his involvement lends “tremendous credibility” to the organization. “Everywhere I go across this country, especially in the center part of the country, because we were founded in relation to Meek, much of our membership is on the coast, on the West Coast. But when I go to the center part of the country, guess who people ask about? They ask about Robert Kraft,” Rooks said. He explained that making change to such deeply entrenched systems takes time, especially with the layers of U.S. government bureaucracy. “The beauty and the pain of our great country is that, with something that has been built at the government level, you have to undo it by changing laws at the federal, state and sometimes county level. And that’s what we have in our massive justice system,” Rooks said. “Probation is a form of accountability, and we're not trying to take the accountability away,” he added. “What we are doing is saying that there's a better way to do it and as a way we can incentivize good behaviors.”",Local,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 17:10:27 EST",fc0f64e9a6dd8212610085ded0070c98

Healey says she’s “focused on affordability” to keep people from moving away.,"Gov. Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state’s future, saying she sees a “big need” to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families. Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state’s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states. “We need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,” Healey said. As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up. Healey’s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey’s tax package — a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million — earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.""By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor’s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state’s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,"" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement. In an interview later Thursday on GBH’s Boston Public Radio, Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts’ tax policy more in line with other states. “Only 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, … we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,” Healey said. “But honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state. She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year. Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance. In other budget matters, Healey said she’s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education. She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. “We need to do everything we can to get rid of them,” Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country. Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people’s voices to the table and that she “might even have a youth council of my own” at some point. She said she’ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected.",Politics,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:35:58 EST",6482378a56e852ea0dcbe9719535ac27
3405,Boston redistricting challenge kicks off in federal court,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/28/boston-redistricting-challenge-kicks-off-in-federal-court,At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty takes the stand for three hours as a witness.,"The process that yielded Boston’s latest voting map was both a strategy to protect incumbents and a “racial diluting” of the city’s long-held majority-minority seat in Mattapan, At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty testified in federal court Tuesday.His comments came during the opening hearing of the case challenging the legality of the voting map approved by the council and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last November.Flaherty, who is in his 20th year on the Boston City Council, argued fellow councilors who ultimately approved the map were less experienced with the redistricting process and wrongly focused on racial demographics. “We’re here today because people disregarded the advice of professional experts,” Flaherty proclaimed, pointing to a memo drafted by Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and adjunct professor at New York Law School. The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including “population equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.”“[The council’s] primary objective,” Flaherty argued, was “population balancing” — which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city’s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city’s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. “We didn’t need to do anything else,” he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council’s “rushed” adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.""I need to have this done by the end of April?"" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty’s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston’s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.“This case is ultimately about choices,” said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made “modest” changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city’s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city’s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city’s redistricting committee amid last year’s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday’s hearing and said his colleague’s testimony illustrated “just how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.”“I think it’s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs … and I think it’s pretty clear at this point that there’s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,"" he said. The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday.",Politics,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:32:10 EST",1ef343cc378be0db19c68c6b3ff0f19a

Some households will see a cut of $250 a month or more, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research institute. ""This is a change that will increase hardship for many individuals and families, especially given the modest amount of regular SNAP benefits, which are only about $6 per person per day, on average,"" says Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy for the institute.More than 40 million people in the U.S. are helped out each month by SNAP. Some states had already phased out the pandemic assistance, and the remaining 32 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands issued their last emergency benefits in February.The cut in SNAP benefits comes as food prices continue to rise.

The pandemic boost in SNAP allotments helped her eat well and preserve her Social Security money for other things.

One strategy to save money is to cut back on meat and fresh produce and stock up on cheaper foods, such as crackers, bread and rice, she says. But Phares knows this isn't good for her. ""The cheapest stuff is the less healthy stuff,"" Phares says. ""I learned that, because I gained a lot of weight eating on the cheaper stuff — the starches, the crackers. And now that I've gotten myself to a better weight, I'm going to have to figure that out,"" she says.Rosenbaum says the annual cost-of-living increase built into SNAP will help ""soften"" the blow from the cut in emergency allotments. In addition, a re-evaluation of benefits in 2021 aimed at making nutritious foods more affordable led to a bump in payments, which also partially offsets the cuts. Even so, in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, nearly 9.5 million older adults, ages 50 and up, were considered ""food insecure"", meaning they sometimes struggled to afford all the food they needed, according to an AARP analysis. In addition, an estimated 9 million children live in food insecure homes, according to No Kid Hungry, a nonprofit group that works to end hunger. Overall, about 10% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in 2021. ""SNAP remains our most powerful tool for combating hunger,"" Rosenbaum says. ""It's found to be linked to improved health, education and economic outcomes and to lower medical costs,"" she says.This year, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill re-authorize the farm bill, which includes a review of the SNAP program, advocates say there's an opportunity to strengthen the program, especially at a time when diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are on the rise. A recent CDC report found 1 in 2 young children in the U.S. don't eat a daily vegetable, but most consume plenty of sugary drinks. And about 1 in 5 children in the U.S. have obesity. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force recommends strengthening food and nutrition security through the farm bill, including expanding the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program that gives SNAP recipients more money to buy fruits and vegetables.This is similar to the Double Up Food Bucks program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which doubles the value of SNAP benefits when used to buy produce at farmers markets and other venues. Another idea is to strengthen standards for retailers to encourage a wider variety of nutritious foods in stores.The farm bill, which is typically re-authorized every five years, is set to expire at the end of September. It's a massive piece of legislation that governs everything from agriculture subsidies to nutrition programs, including SNAP. ""[We're] looking at the farm bill as anti-hunger legislation,"" says Eric Mitchell, executive director of the Alliance to End Hunger. Mitchell says there's lots of momentum — from a wide variety of groups, policymakers to healthcare organizations — to scale up programs that can be beneficial. Mitchell points to a couple of examples: ""Being able to use SNAP benefits at your local farmers markets, as well as creating food pharmacies where you can use your SNAP benefits to purchase healthy foods to help improve your health outcomes.""In the meantime there are still many people in need. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective, Ohio's largest food bank, has seen an increase in the need for its services even before the emergency benefits ran out.Carlis Phares says with a reduced benefit she'll have to rely on some basics from the food bank. ""I think there's going to be a whole lot of people going to the food banks,"" she says. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:01:00 EST",dd84c05b6f1cef5b0b3a9f76db44677d

5839,Seattle becomes the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/22/seattle-becomes-the-first-u-s-city-to-ban-caste-discrimination,"SEATTLE — The Seattle City Council on Tuesday added caste to the city's anti-discrimination laws, becoming the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination and the first in the world to pass such a law outside South Asia.","SEATTLE — The Seattle City Council on Tuesday added caste to the city's anti-discrimination laws, becoming the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination and the first in the world to pass such a law outside South Asia.Calls to outlaw discrimination based on caste, a division of people based on birth or descent, have grown louder among South Asian diaspora communities in the United States. But the movement has been getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.Tensions within the community were visible at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday as a noisy hearing culminated with a 6-1 vote with a majority of the council agreeing that caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.The packed room, which overflowed with activists from both sides bearing banners, chanting slogans, challenging speakers and city officials as they made their comments, laid bare stark divisions over this issue within the South Asian diaspora. A majority of those present in council chambers were supporters of the ordinance and those opposed were a vocal minority.As council members voted in favor of the ordinance, the chamber erupted into cheers of ""Jai Bhim,"" which means ""victory for Bhim"" a rallying cry adopted by followers of B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian Dalit rights icon whose given name was Bhimrao. Dalit groups and their supporters say caste discrimination is prevalent in U.S. diaspora communities, manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.Yogesh Mane, a Seattle resident who grew up as an untouchable in India, broke into tears as he heard the council's decision.""I'm emotional because this is the first time such an ordinance has been passed anywhere in the world outside of South Asia,"" he said. ""It's a historic moment.""Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, whose advocacy work along with community partners continues to push caste discrimination laws forward, called the council vote ""a culture war that has been won.""""We got the support of over 200 organizations from Seattle and around the country,"" she said. ""It's a powerful message that Dalit people are not alone. The South Asian community has united to say we want to heal from the trauma of caste.""Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. Sawant said the council received over 4,000 emails in support of the ordinance.""We've heard hundreds of gut-wrenching stories over the last few weeks showing us that caste discrimination is very real in Seattle,"" she said.Council Member Sara Nelson who cast the lone dissenting vote agreed with opponents calling the ordinance ""a reckless, harmful solution to a problem for which we have no data or research.""""This could generate more anti-Hindu discrimination and could dissuade employers from hiring South Asians,"" she said. ""The community that is being impacted is deeply divided on this issue.""Nelson also said the ordinance would also get the city entangled in legal battles to which Sawant responded: ""Bring it on."" Sawant said being fearful of lawsuits is not the way to effect progress or change.Council Member Lisa Herbold questioned opponents' logic that the law singles out Hindus and people of Indian descent.""That's like saying gender discrimination laws single out all men,"" she said. ""And just because we have a small population that is experiencing (caste discrimination) that doesn't make it any less important.""Shobha Swamy, a representative of the Coalition of Hindus of North America said she was disappointed by the council deliberations and line of questioning. The group said they received a show of support from over 100 organizations.""Due diligence wasn't done,"" said Swami, who flew in from Atlanta.C.H. Srikrishna, a San Francisco Bay Area-based tech worker, said he is worried about the ramifications this ordinance might have for the South Asian community.""I too want discrimination to end,"" he said. ""But we need to first determine that widespread discrimination exists.""Srikrishna, who is Hindu, believes the ordinance does target his religion.""When you say it originated 2,000 years ago, that is implicitly blaming Hinduism,"" he said. ""That bothers me. I feel betrayed.""Sanjay Patel, a tech company owner from the Seattle area, said he never felt discriminated against in the U.S. as a member of a lower caste and that the ordinance pained him because it reminded him of a caste identity, which he thought had become obsolete.""I fear with this law, businesses will be afraid to hire South Asians,"" he said.Earlier Tuesday morning, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting where more than 300 people had requested to speak virtually and in person. They heard about half of the comments before moving on to deliberations and the vote.The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one's occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid — known as Dalits — has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation's independence from British rule.The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination.In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.

790,State budget writers weigh how to handle waning federal aid,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/07/state-budget-writers-weigh-how-to-handle-waning-federal-aid,"As the end of the COVID-19 emergency nears, costs will shift back to the state.","Gov. Maura Healey wants her $55.5 billion state budget to offer a “glide path” to help Massachusetts and its residents adapt to the coming end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency, she told state lawmakers Tuesday. During the pandemic, the federal government stepped up its support for an array of state programs. But with the emergency now set to expire on May 11, one major question facing Beacon Hill budget writers is how much of that spending the state can afford on its own. As Healey and her budget team briefed the Legislature’s Ways and Means Committee on the details of her spending plan, its House and Senate chairmen both had the emergency’s end on their mind. “From food assistance to greater SNAP benefits to expanded funds for MassHealth, those COVID-era programs are being phased out by the federal government for one reason or another,” House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said. “The commonwealth has picked up the cost for some of these programs over the last couple years, such as universal school meals. However, a longer-term, more fiscally realistic approach needs to be addressed as we determine how to best manage this phasing-out of certain federal programs going forward.” In addition to Healey’s annual budget proposal, lawmakers are currently working their way through a separate supplemental spending bill that would steer $65 million more into the state’s free school meals program and use $130 million in state money to provide some elevated SNAP benefits after the federal government’s pandemic-era boost to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired last week.“Obviously the last three years have been unprecedented in terms of what we’ve seen, including relief that’s come from the federal government, and with the recognition that’s going away, our proposal and where we’ve been on a few things that we’ve filed is an effort to try to work, of course, with all of you in providing people with a basic glide path off of this,” Healey told lawmakers. MassHealth, the Massachusetts Medicaid program, is the single largest program state government operates, accounting for over 30% of overall spending. Healey’s budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 funds MassHealth at $19.8 billion, down $1.9 billion from this year’s estimated spending. Matt Gorzkowicz, Healey’s administration and finance secretary, said Tuesday that decrease is driven by a projected drop in MassHealth’s caseload. Preliminary projections show the current caseload of 2.3 million MassHealth members could be down to 1.9 million by the end of the next fiscal year, he said. State Medicaid agencies received additional federal reimbursement during the public health emergency, tied to a freeze in eligibility redeterminations that move people off Medicaid coverage when they no longer qualify for it. Gorzkowicz said the $19.8 billion funding level for MassHealth “maintains affordable, equitable, comprehensive health care coverage for Medicaid-eligible members without reducing benefits.” He said the agency has outreach plans in place, and Healey's budget proposes $5 million in additional funding at the Executive Office of Health and Human Services for communication with MassHealth members. “The goal is not to simply disenroll folks,” Gorzkowicz said. “The goal is to determine proper eligibility, proper coverage of care, and make sure that through our Health Connector and through employer-sponsored insurance that folks have the insurance they need.” Healey, who met with Biden administration officials on a trip to Washington, D.C. last month, told lawmakers she’s ready to advocate with the federal government for what the state needs. “I will tell you and offer to you that whatever I can do in terms of advocacy vis-a-vis the Biden administration with respect to making some allowances or changing the course of some of what is happening around the end of the public health emergency,” she said. Lawmakers on the Ways and Means Committee plan seven other hearings on Healey’s budget before the House and Senate each rewrite her bill and debate their own versions. The next hearing, focused on education and local aid, is scheduled for Monday, March 13, at UMass Amherst. GBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.“Fare-free buses are better buses”, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. “It really does add up, especially for lower income households.""The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered “transit critical,” meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds. “These routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,” Franklin-Hodge said. “If there’s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it’s the people who need it most.""While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders. “I go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it’s on a straight route,” one rider who participated in a focus group said. “The 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister’s house.”A recent GBH news report analyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.“It reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,” Franklin-Hodge said. “We have video. You can see, at some of the big stations … the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.”The fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It’s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future — and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.“Where can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?” Franklin-Hodge said. “We’re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.”",Local,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 13:18:07 EST",8f48ec1e9d51a18a105fbbcb96aa8b6d

The range would reduce the amount of time it takes soldiers at Joint Base Cape Cod to complete their training, says the Massachusetts Army National Guard — they currently have to travel hours to perform required small arms training. But the EPA's latest report suggests local resident's drinking water could be jeopardized if the eight-lane, $11.5 million range is built. ""The biggest concern by far is for the Cape's water supply,"" said Steve Junker, managing editor of news at CAI. ""It supplies water for more than 200,000 year round residents. And it's already compromised and it's compromised by this very same military base... They'll be firing more than a million bullets per year, which they feel is almost certain to further compromise that aquifer that goes under the base.""And Rhode Island officials are texting residents in high risk areas urging them to carry Narcan — also known as naloxone — a medicine that quickly reverses an overdose. There were at least 860 overdose deaths in Rhode Island from 2021-2022, but this April, state officials sent texts offering free Narcan to residents in the Providence area, and they recieved a significant response: ""The prior year, they had zero requests for naloxone. As soon as they sent out that text message, within a week, they get 166 requests for naloxone,"" Tim White, managing editor for WPRI, told Under the Radar. ""Of course, they can't count how many lives that may have potentially saved. But, you know, naloxone does just that, it reverses the effects of an opioid overdose... And unfortunately, in Rhode Island, at least, the data from 2022, which is still being put together, is on track to to match the number of overdose deaths that we saw in 2021, which was the deadliest year on record.""Plus, Republican opposition forced the take down of a historical marker honoring a New Hampshire labor leader and feminist organizer just weeks after it was unveiled.""She was a feminist who advocated for workers rights, for freedom of speech,"" said Arnie Arnesen, host of “The Attitude with Arnie Arnesen” on WNHN. ""She became a leader in the Communist Party, believing that capitalism was at the root of inequality. I wonder where she got that from. But she loved America. 'It could be paradise on earth if it belonged to the people, but not to a small owning class,' that's a quote from her. No one can take my love of country away from me. But the same GOP is in love, too, with a hater of democracy, a sexual abuser, a liar, a man obsessed with revenge.

2629,Amateur sleuths unveil the women behind 132-year-old Boston Harbor adventure journal,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/08/amateur-sleuths-unveil-the-women-behind-132-year-old-boston-harbor-adventure-journal,"“Staggered” by its beauty, a scholar snatched up the journal, with aged photographs, exquisite watercolors and descriptions of the isle.","On the toasty morning of July 15, 1891, four middle-aged women met at Rowes Wharf in Boston, boarded a boat and set sail for one of the outermost harbor islands: Great Brewster. At the time, its rugged landscape was home to little more than a smattering of structures — including ""huts of refuge"" for potential shipwreck survivors — and a single cow that roamed the island. The women were leaving their husbands, children and responsibilities behind for more than two weeks in search of adventure and the joy of female friendship. Their provisions included food, art supplies, literature and one leather-bound journal. And it’s that journal that, over a century later, mesmerized Boston-based author Stephanie Schorow when she came across the volume in Harvard’s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.“But there was one big problem with it,” Schorow said. “We knew the identity of one of the women in the diary. But we didn’t know the other three women. Now, we had their photos — but we did not have their names.”The journal detailed the cold corned beef they ate and the poetry they read by moonlight. It recorded the tides and the flora of the island. Photographs, a novelty back then, showed their rustic cottage. It was the site where they pitched a hammock and hoisted an American flag — which, at the time, had only 43 stars. They adopted their own playful language — a mix of Shakespearean and swashbuckler — sprinkling in the word “Ye” for flair. “The women in the journal were only identified by their nicknames: The Autocrat, the Aristocrat, the Acrobat and the Scribe — which, when you get down to it, are kind of weird nicknames,” Schorow said.One of the women, whose moniker was “Ye Veracious Scribe,” had already been identified as Helen Augusta Whittier, a Lowell resident whose name was found on a handwritten note in the journal. Schorow tried to focus on her other projects: she’s the author of several books on Boston’s history. But the journal — and the peculiar women who created it — kept returning to her mind, and the hunch that its creators had their own contributions to make to modern-day scholarship.Schorow made a few phone calls to solicit help identifying the women.A collection of about 10 people, almost exclusively older women, stepped forward to volunteer their research skills in 2020, when the pandemic kept them all home. Over Zoom and emails, they began by transcribing the journal, which, due to the abundance of “ye”s and antiquated penmanship, wasn’t simple.“They don’t teach cursive to students anymore. But we’re old gals. So we wrote in cursive. We could decipher it,” Schorow said. “But even then, there were some parts we’d say, ‘I don’t know what they’re saying here.’”Once the journal was transcribed, the next task was to distinguish which woman — their names still unknown — wrote which entries. One of the investigators, Allison Andrews, had previous experience evaluating handwriting and cataloguing photographs. She noticed that some of the writers used periods, and some wrote with a dash. The group stitched together census records, newspaper clippings and public records from genealogy websites. And now, after years of research, they feel confident they have identified all four women: Helen Francis Ray French was the “Ye Autocrat.” The daughter of a clothing manufacturer in Lowell, she later ran a lodging house with her husband. “Ye Gentle Aristocrat” was Sarah Elizabeth “Lizzie” Dean Adams, a founding member of two humanitarian clubs in New England.“Ye Artistic Acrobat” was Isabella Coburn, a well-known painter who studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and what’s now the Massachusetts College of Art. Coburn died of heart failure four years after the trip. And the trip’s ringleader, nicknamed “Ye Veracious Scribe,” was Helen Augustua Whittier. She never married and ran her family’s textile mill in Lowell, before founding a Boston newsletter for women and becoming a leader in New England’s women’s suffrage movement. “We can only suppose that they were trying to say to the world, ‘We can do it ourselves. Women can do it ourselves,’” Schorow said.Journal entries describe how they foraged and fished: After dinner, 2 of them, with rubbers, pails and spoons, left to go get clams. With regret, they left a ruddy sunset and soon found their friends with long face and cut hands...but no clams.Yet another page has a small, exquisite watercolor painting of a lobster with the handwritten caption: “Ye hot lobster.”Professor John Stilgoe, who teaches the history of landscape at Harvard University, first discovered the journal in a used book store while on a bike ride in Cape Ann in 1999. On the counter inside, the leather-bound volume lay open, its pages an organic collection of cursive writing, watercolors and early photographs depicting women on a remote coast. “I took one look at it and was staggered by its beauty,” he said. He pledged to the bookseller that Harvard would buy it. “And put down my own credit card and told him if Harvard didn’t buy it, I would buy it.” Harvard pounced, buying the volume sight-unseen. Stilgoe said he was not surprised the women knew how to describe, draw and paint the plants and seascape around them: He’s researched how educated American women in that era studied Latin and botany. But Stilgoe’s discovery at the bookstore was not the first time the book had been rescued. Ann Marie Allen is a retired chemist and theologian who helped solve the mystery. She said the journal has had several close calls, starting with that inaugural trip to the rustic cottage more than a century ago.“When it rained, [the roof] leaked. It poured inside the house. And they talked about running around and getting buckets to catch the water. They talked about rescuing the book that we’re talking about — rescuing that log book from the deluge that was coming through the roof,” Allen said.The last page of the journal is a watercolor painting of the island with the rickety cottage. In the margin is the handwritten note, “A small green isle — it seemed — no more.” One of the essays the women read aloud was “Westminster Abbey,” a somber reflection by Washington Irving on the fleeting of time.“And one of them made mention of memories, and things we leave behind for people to find out something about ourselves. And I just thought, those women quoted from or read that particular passage. Did they ever dream that their journal was going to be looked at over 100 years later?” Allen said.Irving wrote: Time is ever silently turning over his pages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present, to think of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten.But this leather-bound volume will not be forgotten. These modern-day sleuths have joined hands with the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands to publish the journal in June.

5108,Bruce Brown's road to the NBA Finals began in Boston and Wakefield,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/12/bruce-browns-road-to-the-nba-finals-began-in-boston-and-wakefield,Brown has been a key member of the Denver Nuggets run to the Finals.,"The first time Brendan Kent laid eyes on Bruce Brown on a basketball court, he knew he was in trouble. Kent, who is now the director of athletics for Wakefield Public Schools, was on the coaching staff at Melrose High School when he was assigned to go scout rival Wakefield Memorial High School during Brown’s freshman year there. What he saw next he’ll never forget.“So, I go to the Wakefield gym, I sit down and literally just as I sit down, [Brown] steals the ball on defense, goes the length of the court and just goes up and slams it in, dunk. As a freshman,” he said. “And I just remember immediately texting the head coach saying, ‘We have a problem.’”The now key member of the Denver Nuggets has plenty of stories just like that in his journey to the NBA Finals. Brown is averaging 11.8 points per game coming off the bench for Denver so far in this year’s NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, including a scorching Game 4 performance on Friday where he racked up 21 points, including 11 points in the fourth quarter, on 8 of 11 shot attempts and made two free throws to help put the Nuggets within one win of the franchise’s first ever NBA championship.But just like any NBA player, Brown’s success didn’t start in the arena. The Dorchester native's foundation started on courts in Boston and Wakefield, where he spent his first two years of high school, where many friends and coaches knew he’d be special. Brad Simpson was the longtime head coach at Wakefield when Brown came there through the METCO program, though Simpson says Brown was originally going to enroll at school in Milton. But when Brown’s mother was told there wouldn’t be enough room on the bus for both Brown and his younger brother, she sent them to Wakefield instead.“So, I don’t play the lottery anymore,” Simpson said. “‘Cause I won it when Bruce switched schools and came to Wakefield.”Brown only spent two seasons at Wakefield before heading off to Vermont Academy and eventually the University of Miami for college. But in that short time, Simpson already had an idea of what kind of player Brown would become. One day before practice his freshman year, the coach had a foretelling conversation with Brown. “I sat him down and I said, ‘Bruce, this is how it’s gonna work. If you don’t know this already, I’m gonna watch you on TV someday.’ I was thinking Division I college basketball, I wasn’t thinking professional basketball,” Simpson said with a laugh. “And I said, ‘You can’t stay at Wakefield, I know how it works. Hopefully, we’ll have you for a couple of years, but some prep school’s gonna scoop you up, you’re gonna reclassify and then you’re gonna go to a DI school. So that’s the plan.’ And that’s pretty much what happened.”Although he played high school ball outside the city, Brown’s legacy in Boston is much the same as it is in Wakefield. Leo Papile founded the Boston Amateur Basketball Club, a youth program, in 1977. Since then, the BABC has included future NBA players like Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing, Brown, Georges Niang of the Philadelphia 76ers, Terance Mann of the Los Angeles Clippers and others.Papile said Brown will be in the program’s hall of fame. The BABC stresses a “we, not me” mentality, something Papile’s seen Brown has carried to the pros, as he has stayed in touch with many of his early teammates.“You know, those significant team accomplishments I think is how he’d want his obituary [written], you know, for the basketball game,” Papile said. “Not that he was averaging 'x' amount of points or he had [21 points] in a big fourth quarter explosion in a ... fourth game of a championship. I think he’d rather see it that he was a member of an NBA champion, you know, knowing him as well as we do.”Even though everyone could see Brown’s potential growing up, it’s not every day you see someone you know drop buckets in the Finals. For Brad Simpson, watching his former pupil excel on the game’s biggest stage has been a pinch-me moment.“You’ve gotta kind of sit back and you take stock and say, ‘Holy s***, this is a guy that I coached!’” Simpson said. “It’s like, I’m not looking at him like a coach, I’m looking at him like a fan. I mean, I’m in his fan club. I’m a card-carrying member of Bruce Brown’s fan club.”Brown spent two seasons a piece as a bit of a nomad with the Detroit Pistons and the Brooklyn Nets before finding a professional home in the Rocky Mountains. And while the Finals are where big names like Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray shine, it’s players like Brown that can help push a series over the edge. Speaking after his Game 4 performance, Brown said the journey he’s had wasn’t too heavy on his mind“I knew coming into the league what I could do. It was just, a team had to give me a chance,” Brown said to the Boston Globe’s Gary Washburn. “And [former Detroit Pistons coach] Dwane Casey did. I started my rookie year, I did very well. So, I thank him for that. But now, doing that on this stage, it’s amazing. But I’ll think about it when we’re done.”",Local,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 12:04:49 EST",e9cca21351e0cb57cc3037c8bcbfccf9

The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the former president on Tuesday, ordering adult film star Stormy Daniels to pay $121,972 in legal fees for a failed defamation suit. The ruling is not legally connected with the Manhattan district attorney's investigation that led Trump to be charged with 34 felony counts on Tuesday. But it does stem from the same event: Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, then was paid by Trump's legal team to avoid going public with the story ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump denies the affair but has since admitted he reimbursed his then-attorney Michael Cohen for the hush money payments.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Cliffords, tried to sue Trump for defamation in 2018, specifically taking aim at a tweet attacking her account of being threatened by a stranger in 2011 to stay quiet on her Trump story. Trump attacked the account as a ""con job, playing the Fake News Media."" Federal Judge S. James Otero dismissed the lawsuit, saying Trump's tweet constitutes "" 'rhetorical hyperbole' normally associated with politics and public discourse"" and is protected by the First Amendment. Daniels tried to appeal the decision in 2022, saying her then-attorney Michael Avenatti filed the defamation suit ""without my permission and against my wishes."" But a judge ruled against her, leaving her on the hook for nearly $300,000 in Trump's legal fees.Daniels subsequently filed a motion to knock down the fee payment. On Tuesday, the court dismissed in part her latest request, which only increased the bill she has to pay. Daniels argued that the fee request was ""unreasonable and excessive,"" saying the law group had overstaffed the appeal and performed duplicative tasks, and asked for fees to be reduced, court documents show.She specifically asked the judge to cap the law firm's rates at $500/hourly for partners and $350/hourly for associates — a request the appeals commissioner denied on account of ""inflation and increase in the attorneys' experience."" The court denied a secondary request for Daniels to reimburse Trump $5,150 for time responding to the most recent appeal, saying the request lacked itemized detail about the law firm's billing. ""Collectively, our firm obtained over $600,000 in attorney fee awards in his favor in the meritless litigation initiated by Stormy Daniels,"" said Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillion in a tweet celebrating the legal victory. After the appeals court ruled against her last year, Daniels tweeted: ""I will go to jail before I pay a penny.""

""For many, many years it was sort of a hush-hush kind of underground thing. We didn't publicize it. You just had to be kind of in the know to take in this special opportunity for three or four weeks every spring,"" he said. ""Now, with the rise of social media, we've had a flock of interest.""The Dartmouth Natural Resources Trust isn't the only Massachusetts space where you can can enjoy blankets of yellow daffodils in bloom. The Trustees has spring flower shows in North Andover and Stockbridge, and the New England Botanic Garden at Tower Hill in Boylston boasts a daffodil field with over 25,000 bulbs. Mark Richardson, the botanic garden's director of horticulture, says the first of those bulbs were planted in 1991, and the field has grown in the decades since. ""Daffodils are naturalizing, so they continue to grow every single year. So, that one bulb that you plant probably turns into the equivalent of six or eight bulbs over time,"" he explained. ""So there's tons and tons of blooms out in the daffodil field right now. It looks fantastic."" Richardson says while daffodils aren't native to North America, they have acclimated to New England quite well since they were introduced. ""They're happy. They're well adapted to our soil and temperature conditions,"" he explained.But if you want to see the flowers, don't wait to plan a visit.""They're truly a spring ephemeral,"" Richardson said.

7547,Pandemic food assistance that held back hunger comes to an end,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/01/pandemic-food-assistance-that-held-back-hunger-comes-to-an-end,Millions of Americans will have less to spend on groceries as emergency food assistance that Congress enacted early in the pandemic has ended.,"Millions of Americans will have less to spend on groceries as emergency food assistance that Congress enacted early in the pandemic has ended.On average, individuals will get about $90 less this month in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Some households will see a cut of $250 a month or more, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research institute. ""This is a change that will increase hardship for many individuals and families, especially given the modest amount of regular SNAP benefits, which are only about $6 per person per day, on average,"" says Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy for the institute.More than 40 million people in the U.S. are helped out each month by SNAP. Some states had already phased out the pandemic assistance, and the remaining 32 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands issued their last emergency benefits in February.The cut in SNAP benefits comes as food prices continue to rise. Carlis Phares who is 64 and lives in Columbus, Ohio calls it a double whammy.""It's going to be a lot harder,"" Phares says.Social security is her main source of income, and while those payments include a cost of living adjustment, it hasn't kept up with the increase in rent and other expenses, Phares says. The pandemic boost in SNAP allotments helped her eat well and preserve her Social Security money for other things. Now she'll have to do more with less.""I'm going to figure out how to make it stretch,"" Phares says. One strategy to save money is to cut back on meat and fresh produce and stock up on cheaper foods, such as crackers, bread and rice, she says. But Phares knows this isn't good for her. ""The cheapest stuff is the less healthy stuff,"" Phares says. ""I learned that, because I gained a lot of weight eating on the cheaper stuff — the starches, the crackers. And now that I've gotten myself to a better weight, I'm going to have to figure that out,"" she says.Rosenbaum says the annual cost-of-living increase built into SNAP will help ""soften"" the blow from the cut in emergency allotments. In addition, a re-evaluation of benefits in 2021 aimed at making nutritious foods more affordable led to a bump in payments, which also partially offsets the cuts. Even so, in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, nearly 9.5 million older adults, ages 50 and up, were considered ""food insecure"", meaning they sometimes struggled to afford all the food they needed, according to an AARP analysis. In addition, an estimated 9 million children live in food insecure homes, according to No Kid Hungry, a nonprofit group that works to end hunger. Overall, about 10% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in 2021. ""SNAP remains our most powerful tool for combating hunger,"" Rosenbaum says. ""It's found to be linked to improved health, education and economic outcomes and to lower medical costs,"" she says.This year, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill re-authorize the farm bill, which includes a review of the SNAP program, advocates say there's an opportunity to strengthen the program, especially at a time when diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are on the rise. A recent CDC report found 1 in 2 young children in the U.S. don't eat a daily vegetable, but most consume plenty of sugary drinks. And about 1 in 5 children in the U.S. have obesity. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force recommends strengthening food and nutrition security through the farm bill, including expanding the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program that gives SNAP recipients more money to buy fruits and vegetables.This is similar to the Double Up Food Bucks program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which doubles the value of SNAP benefits when used to buy produce at farmers markets and other venues. Another idea is to strengthen standards for retailers to encourage a wider variety of nutritious foods in stores.The farm bill, which is typically re-authorized every five years, is set to expire at the end of September. It's a massive piece of legislation that governs everything from agriculture subsidies to nutrition programs, including SNAP. ""[We're] looking at the farm bill as anti-hunger legislation,"" says Eric Mitchell, executive director of the Alliance to End Hunger. Mitchell says there's lots of momentum — from a wide variety of groups, policymakers to healthcare organizations — to scale up programs that can be beneficial. Mitchell points to a couple of examples: ""Being able to use SNAP benefits at your local farmers markets, as well as creating food pharmacies where you can use your SNAP benefits to purchase healthy foods to help improve your health outcomes.""In the meantime there are still many people in need. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective, Ohio's largest food bank, has seen an increase in the need for its services even before the emergency benefits ran out.Carlis Phares says with a reduced benefit she'll have to rely on some basics from the food bank. ""I think there's going to be a whole lot of people going to the food banks,"" she says. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:01:00 EST",dd84c05b6f1cef5b0b3a9f76db44677d

This represents a 25% increase in that gap over the decade.”The new report retrospectively examined just over a half-million hospital discharge records of Massachusetts residents between 2011 and 2020. Those that met the criteria for severe maternal morbidity rose from roughly 1 out of every 200 deliveries at the start of the review period to 1 in 100 in 2020. Rates of severe complications were significantly higher for people over the age of 40, as well as those who are Black or who have an intellectual disability. Health experts and community advocates both say the disparities in the data reveal the need for officials to target structural discrimination that creates inequitable maternal health care.Colin Killick, executive director of the Disability Policy Consortium, told GBH News that the medical system often fails to understand disabled patients’ needs or devalues them. Still, he was surprised the report’s findings of just how many people with disabilities experience severe complications during labor and delivery.“I hope that finally this means that major entities in this field will reach out to our community and ask us what they can do and really engage us, and engage the disabled patients as partners in this effort,” he said. “Because otherwise, I think that this disparity is going to only continue and may even get worse.”Rebecca Hart Holder, president of Reproductive Equity Now, also expressed dismay over the statistics in the report. In a statement, she said Massachusetts has a responsibility to step up and improve these health outcomes.“We must remember that these data points are more than numbers. We’re dealing with people’s lives and livelihoods and we cannot wait to act any longer,” she said.Dr. Fifi Diop, director of the Division of Maternal and Child Health Research and Analysis at the Department of Public Health, agreed the state needs to act to improve these health outcomes.“Traditionally, we have blamed Black patients for their complications, or even for dying,” Diop said. “The argument is that they come to pregnancy sicker, overweight or obese or older. ... But the truth is that, actually, that's not an individual problem. It's a societal and structural problem: whether or not people have access to healthy food, clean water, insurance coverage and access to health care — these are policies and structural decisions.”Diop said the state and health care workers need to “work upstream” to better support pregnant people from medically underserved communities. The Department of Public Health has already taken several steps toward that goal, including funding anti-racism training for medical providers and establishing a statewide maternal health task force.“So far, the task force has met three times,” said Diop, “and the goal of the task force is to develop [and] draft a strategic plan with specific and actionable objectives by September 2023.”",Local,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 18:32:56 EST",50b0bf4b1505b91443a02ecdc42db694

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley had requested $2 million in federal funding to help finance the project, of which $850,000 made it onto the final appropriation bill. Fellow Democratic Reps. Brendan Boyle and Chrissy Houlahan had also sought federal funding for LGBTQ+ projects in Pennsylvania. House Republicans struck all three earmarks.The Pryde, a $47 million project currently under construction, is slated to include 74 mixed-income rental units in addition to a public community center. A housing lottery is expected to be held in the fall, with the building to open within six months.The federal earmark for The Pryde was intended to help with unexpected construction costs from renovating such an old building. But Gretchen Van Ness, executive director of LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc., one of the groups behind The Pryde, said she is determined to find that additional capital one way or another.""We are grateful for the support that we've received in the state budget,"" said Van Ness. ""Rep. Rob Consalvo and state Sen. Liz Miranda have earmarked $250,000 for us in the state budget.""According to Van Ness, LGBTQ+ seniors are more likely to face discrimination and harassment in housing and need a welcoming and safe place to live.“These are the folks that we owe everything to,” said Van Ness. “We stand on their shoulders, and they should be able to live with dignity and their full, authentic selves as they as they grow older.”Pressley criticized yesterday’s decision by Republicans as an “act of blatant homophobia & hatred.”“It is unconscionable that Republican committee members would hold senior citizen-specific housing hostage and continue their dangerous national trend of targeting the LGBTQ+ community,” the Massachusetts congresswoman said in a statement. “This process is intended for our communities to advocate for projects that have the highest impact, and this move by Republicans is blatant homophobia designed to attack some of our most vulnerable seniors.”Van Ness also said that yesterday’s decision to exclude LGBTQ+ projects from community project funding is unprecedented. “If anything, people should see what happened to us yesterday as the reason why we're doing what we're doing,” said Van Ness. “We are not afraid of the work that we're doing. We're not afraid of this backlash. We are deeply, deeply committed to our community and to providing the kind of housing that we're building at The Pryde.”SeparatorClarification: This story was updated to clarify the amount of funding Rep.

At least that’s the argument made by the co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Transportation. A committee report found 57 safety failures at the T that were not connected to a lack of funding. Instead, “these were oversight management problems of a historic nature that has plagued this system,” Rep. Bill Straus told Boston Public Radio on Monday. Yet, Straus and his co-chair, State Sen. Brendan Crighton, also said that a well-funded T is key to its success. In response to the safety concerns and directives from the Federal Transit Administration, the legislature provided close to $400 million to meet the FTA’s requirements and another $400 million for authorization. “When we have a willing partner that's there to say we need these resources, we've delivered,” said Crighton. Straus doesn’t think current funding is sufficient, even though the MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng said at an oversight hearing a few weeks ago that the T had enough funds to operate and meet safety requirements. “My concern is that while we significantly added to transportation and education …with the millionaire's tax, frankly, the $500 million a year that will come this new fiscal year to transportation is not enough when you consider that the capital needs at the T are in the area of $9 billion,” said Straus. The millionaire’s tax was approved by voters last fall and puts a 4% surtax on the portion of an individual's income over $1 million to fund education and transportation. Despite an influx in funds from the millionaire’s tax, the state is expected to see a decline in gas tax revenue with the rise in electric vehicles. Plus, Crighton said it’s difficult to raise transportation revenue at the legislative level because there are 200 members with various needs for their districts.To help relieve costs and address structural challenges, Straus advocates for shifting some MBTA responsibilities to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The T would focus on its core mission, which Straus said is to provide safe, reliable and predictable delivery of buses and subways. And commuter rail management would be shifted to MassDOT. “Let's have a T that focuses on what is its core metro area mission,” Straus said. During the live radio discussion, former transportation secretary Jim Aloisi (a frequent BPR contributor) tweeted against this idea. ""Allow me to point out that moving intercity rail from the T to MassDOT is solving a problem that doesn’t exist. Riders need a connected regional transit network,"" the tweet said. Another headline that’s been leading transportation news for several weeks is the Sumner Tunnel closure. As for the expected delays, Crighton said it's been better than anticipated. “I have to tip my cap to the governor and the administration,” he said. Gov. Healey’s administration approved alternative options for commuters going to and from the North Shore, like a ferry from Lynn, free fares on the Blue Line and reduced commuter rail parking fees at the Wonderland stop. Crighton said he’s happy to see the success of the Lynn ferry. “We have people turned away every day. I don't want them turned away, but I'm glad to see public transit is now being used. And maybe this is something that should be continuing in the future along all three of those modes,” Crighton said.",Local,"Mon, 17 Jul 2023 16:34:41 EST",434db2aa90858ad1ecc9c7babb2e5cca

7739,EPA's move to limit 'forever chemicals' would go beyond Massachusetts' existing regulations,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/14/epas-move-to-limit-forever-chemicals-would-go-beyond-massachusetts-existing-regulations,The federal proposal to safeguard drinking water would set lower limits than the state currently has.,"Updated at 8:58 a.m.SeparatorThe Environmental Protection Agency today announced a plan to regulate and reduce harmful PFAS chemicals from drinking water. It’s the first time the federal government has moved to set a national drinking water standard for the so-called “forever” chemicals. The proposal could take effect later this year, setting new practices in many regions while expanding on existing standards in the few states — including Massachusetts — that already regulate the synthetic chemicals.The proposed regulations would move to seriously limit six PFAS chemicals, targeting two that are particularly notorious: PFOA and PFOS. The agency is proposing to regulate them at 4 parts per trillion. To visualize that, experts often draw on analogy: it’s roughly the equivalent of four droplets in an Olympic-sized swimming pool filled with water. That high standard is an indicator of just how dangerous regulators believe these chemicals are. It follows last year’s findings by the EPA that almost no level of exposure to the chemicals is safe, and PFAS could cause harm at levels “much lower than previously understood.” PFAS — the shorthand for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — is a group made up of some 14,000 known chemicals. The chemicals have the ability to give products oil-, water- and stain-resistant properties, so they can be found in all kinds of consumer products, including carpets, microwave popcorn bags, pans, rain jackets, dental floss, makeup and guitar strings.“What began as a so-called miracle groundbreaking technology meant for practicality and convenience quickly devolved into one of the most pressing environmental and public health concerns in the modern world,” said Michael Regan, EPA administrator. The problem is that these chemicals, which most people are exposed to daily, accumulate in the human body, and they’ve been linked to health problems like cancer, fertility issues, liver damage, thyroid disease, immune system disorders, and others.Under the proposed regulations, public water utilities — often run by towns and cities — would have change the way they operate.""When finalized, this proposed regulation will require public water systems to monitor these chemicals. It will also require systems to notify the public and reduce the levels of these PFAS, as prescribed,” Regan said. ""Folks, this is a tremendous step forward in the right direction. We anticipate that when fully implemented, this rule will prevent thousands of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-related illnesses.” The EPA’s proposed regulations are thrilling to longtime PFAS-control activists.“The proposed EPA drinking water standard is a promising first step in safeguarding our communities from the wide-reaching impacts of PFAS contamination,"" Ayesha Khan of Nantucket PFAS Action Group said in a statement.The state of Massachusetts does regulate six PFAS already, but the proposed federal regulations go further in many ways. The state regulates four of the chemicals that the federal proposal would also regulate. But because the EPA would regulate two chemicals that Massachusetts doesn’t, and Massachusetts is regulating two chemicals the EPA wouldn’t, Bay Staters would benefit from limits on a total of eight PFAS chemicals in drinking water. In addition, the federal regulations would set a lower limit than what's currently allowed in Massachusetts.Overall, the commonwealth is considered one of the nation’s leading states when it comes to PFAS protections, and one of about two dozen states that have any limits on PFAS in drinking water. That’s because of the state leadership, and the fact that Massachusetts has had serious issues with PFAS contaminating drinking water in the past.For example, the EPA designated Otis Air National Guard Base on Joint Base Cape Cod a Superfund site in 1989 because the military dumped harmful chemicals, fuel and firefighting foams into the ground throughout the 20th century, which contaminated Cape Cod’s drinking water. As a result, some towns on the Upper Cape have received money for remediation. “We have an ion exchange filter system at our Fresh Pond well that was paid for by the United States Air Force because of the contamination from Joint Base Cape Cod,” said Michael Reghitto, acting water superintendent for the town of Falmouth.But this federal regulation could still be transformative in Massachusetts. Currently, under Massachusetts law, public water utilities regulate the six PFAS chemicals at 20 parts per trillion. The EPA’s stricter limit at 4 parts per trillion could have major implications, and as a result are raising criticism in some quarters.Concerns specifically center around costs and who bears them. If a town without many resources finds PFAS in drinking water that exceeds these new standards, it may need to come up with millions of dollars — whether that’s from the federal government, grants, or ratepayers — to purchase technology that can filter out the chemicals.“This could be a big financial burden for towns that have PFAS, but don't know the source,” Reghitto said. On the other hand, some critics of the regulations are concerned it doesn’t go far enough.“We can no longer afford this chemical by chemical approach when there are over 14,000 PFAS,"" said Kyla Bennet, science policy director with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). ""And they’re talking about regulating six,”In that sense, the regulations are something like the carnival game of whack-a-mole; if manufacturers are limited from using one of the chemicals, they can switch to another. It would be better, she said, to pass legislation recently filed by Massachusetts lawmakers to regulate PFAS as a class and prohibit it from consumer products. The EPA’s regulations will now undergo a 60-day public comment period. Regan said he hopes they take effect by the end of the year.

6856,Rolling rally highlights push for Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/11/rolling-rally-highlights-push-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers-to-unionize,The question over how tech companies should interact with gig workers has been looming for years on Beacon Hill.,"Honking their horns and cheering as they circled the State House in a caravan, Uber and Lyft drivers rallied with labor groups and other advocates Tuesday to again press Massachusetts lawmakers to pass a bill that would let the drivers unionize and offer other worker protections.Bill supporters say that a union would help drivers negotiate for better pay, benefits and working conditions. It’s a push that’s gone on for more than two years on Beacon Hill, with a union just one of a handful ideas raised by competing groups in the fight over how to legally treat rideshare drivers’ employment. Organizers said more than 500 people participated in Tuesday's event, gathering at a Dorchester parking lot before driving to the State House. Uber driver Betania Gonell said she’s been using the platform for seven years, usually working 60 to 70 hours a week. She said she used to be able to work fewer hours and earn the same amount of money. ""That is frustrating for me because I took this career just to take care of my kids and have time and flexibility for them, but now I don't have even that,” Gonnell said. Gonnell is affiliated with the Drivers Demand Justice Coalition, a group whose members include Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, the International Association of Machinists, the Chinese Progressive Association, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, the Merrimack Valley Project, the Union of Minority Neighborhoods and Latinos Unidos in Massachusetts. That coalition backs the unionization bill, filed in the House by Lawrence Rep. Frank Moran and in the Senate by Sen. Jason Lewis of Winchester and Sen. Liz Miranda of Dorchester. The bill also would guarantee a minimum pay rate and protections like paid sick leave and workers’ compensation. Miranda and Lewis said rideshare drivers deserve the same collective bargaining rights as all other workers in Massachusetts. “It’s time that Uber and Lyft — huge, profitable companies that are exploiting their workforce — are held to account,” Lewis said. Massachusetts policymakers have been trying to get a handle for years on what the relationship should be between platforms like Uber and Lyft and the gig-economy drivers, with labor advocates and the tech giants on different sides of the issue.In 2020, then-Attorney General Maura Healey filed a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft, alleging that the companies were denying drivers protections like a minimum wage by improperly classifying them as independent contractors rather than employees. That suit is still pending. Voters almost had a chance to settle the matter of driver classification last year, when a group supported by rideshare and food delivery companies sought to put a question on the ballot that would have written into state law that the drivers are contractors. The Supreme Judicial Court ultimately struck that question from the ballot, leaving the issue unresolved as a new legislative session started this year. The industry-backed group Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, which has also rallied drivers at the State House this year, says many drivers prefer the independence that comes with contractor status. The group favors one bill that would establish drivers as independent contractors while also providing some new benefits, and another that would create company-funded “portable benefit accounts” for drivers.Conor Yunits, spokesman for the Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, said in a statement to GBH News that unionization bill “would force drivers to become employees for all intents and purposes,” and that his group will “continue to encourage the legislature to bring all parties to the table to find a compromise that protects the independence that drivers demand and the benefits they deserve.”Other bills on Beacon Hill also propose different strategies for addressing the pay, benefits and classification of gig economy drivers. Lawmakers on a pair of committees, the Financial Services Committee and the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, will hold hearings at some point in the two-year session to explore the issues.",Politics,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 18:03:46 EST",8f4c06216e5b483242d4f17dfc4dbd3d

On top of that, the commonwealth had the nation's second-highest number of white supremacist propaganda distribution incidents, with 474 documented instances of distribution in 2022, according to the ""Hate in the Bay State"" report. And the state hasn't been immune to a surge in high-profile instances of anti-LGBTQ activity, either. In response, the ADL is calling on lawmakers to take action, like holding social media companies accountable for hate speech on their platforms and strengthening hate crime reporting and response. Peggy Shukur, the interim regional director of ADL New England, said the numbers of antisemitic incidents, hate crimes and extremist activity have jumped up in New England in recent years. But the recent rise in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric was concerning.""That spike is particularly troubling and really needs to be connected with the other types of hate and antisemitic incidents that we're seeing,"" she said. The report highlighted harassment and threats aimed at Boston Children's Hospital following false narratives spread about the gender-affirming care provided at the facility. Shukur said that while she couldn't directly tie the rise in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric to other hateful activities, groups like the neo-Nazi Nationalist Social Club 131, or NSC-131, are ""equal-opportunity haters."" ""[Our report] takes all of those strands of hate and puts it together so that we can see how broad and widespread this type of hate has become, particularly in New England, particularly in Massachusetts,"" she said. Shukur said that one factor that makes Massachusetts a good target for hate groups is that they get a lot of attention when they gather in public, like at Boston Children's hospital last year or marching through downtown Boston. But she also pointed out that their influence doesn't necessarily correlate with their actual size.In one incident she recalled from 2022, three masked men from NSC-131 hung an antisemitic banner over Route 114 in Danvers. That small group, she said, had an outsized influence. ""But I do like to point out that the community came out to reclaim that bridge,"" she said. ""And several hundred people came in response to the three men who spread that fear and intimidation.""In a statement, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said the report puts on paper what far too many people have experienced.""We stand with the LGBTQ+ community, Jewish community, communities of color, and all who are the targets of hate and discrimination,"" she said. ""I'm grateful to the Anti-Defamation League and their partners for putting forward this important report and our administration is committed to being a strong partner in the work to combat hate in all of its forms."" With the rise in hateful incidents, Shukur said that she hopes that people know that a community response whenever a group is targeted is extraordinarily important. ""So raising awareness and letting people know that a community response is a really important action anybody can take is really a message I'd like to leave people with,"" she said.",Local,"Tue, 23 May 2023 06:01:16 EST",2ad44145f899e3b70c93d2e255c78e02
6684,How a new MLB rule could change baseball games this season,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/27/how-a-new-mlb-rule-could-change-baseball-games-this-season,"There are a few key rule changes coming to Major League Baseball this season, but one in particular already is throwing players for a curve.","There are a few key rule changes coming to Major League Baseball this season, but one in particular already is throwing players for a curve.Spring training games underway in Florida and Arizona have featured a new pitch clock, which gives pitchers a set amount of time before they have to throw the ball.The timer is set to 15 seconds if the bases are empty or 20 seconds if there are runners on base, and the hitter has to be in the batter's box with eight seconds left on the clock.MLB officials say the pitch clock can help reduce the length of games, which have averaged more than three hours long in recent years. But the new rule has drawn some criticism, and over the weekend it caused bewilderment on the diamond.On Saturday, during a spring training matchup between the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox, Braves hitter Cal Conley was called out for failing to get into the batter's box on time. The game — which was in the bottom of the ninth inning with a full count, two outs and the bases loaded — ended in a tie. Conley reacted with shocked laughter.The pitch clock isn't the only new rule popping up this season.First, second and third bases have grown in size from 15 inches square to 18 inches square, which the MLB says will reduce player injuries. The league is also requiring two infielders on each side of the second-base line before a pitch is thrown, preventing them from crowding one side or another in a defensive maneuver known as the ""infield shift.""League officials say the rule changes didn't come out of left field but rather were developed in response to feedback from players and umpires, and were first tested in the minor leagues.""These steps are designed to improve pace of play, increase action, and reduce injuries, all of which are goals that have overwhelming support among our fans,"" MLB commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. said in a statement in September, when the new rules were approved.""Throughout the extensive testing of recent years, Minor League personnel and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better and more enjoyable,"" Manfred added.For example, last year in the minor leagues the pitch clock helped reduce the average length of a game by 25 minutes, and the larger bases led to a 13% reduction in ""injury events"" near the bases, the MLB said.That teams will be able to get used to the new rules — particularly the pitch clock — during spring training. And despite the pushback, some pitchers have suggested the new timer may actually give them an advantage.""I can work extremely quickly, or I can work extremely slow,"" New York Mets star pitcher Max Scherzer told reporters after his first spring training start. ""There is another layer here to be able to mess with the hitter's timing."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 12:29:00 EST",21e014bc9402a7dbf59497e1c30d6089
6812,Top stories GBH News is following this week,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/28/top-stories-gbh-news-is-following-this-week,Gov. Healey is filing her first budget and a local sheriff's office is lowering its minimum hiring age.,"Every week, GBH News assignment editor Matt Baskin joins GBH’s All Things Considered to look at stories the newsroom is following. This week, tune in for updates on Gov. Maura Healey's soon-to-be-released budget, a local sheriff's plan to hire 19-year-olds as correctional officers and the state of Salem's mayoral race. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Baskin and host Arun Rath. Arun Rath: So tomorrow is the first day of March and Gov. Healey is expected to release her proposal for the state’s budget. We had some teasers last week, but do we have any sense of what else we might be looking for? Matt Baskin: A bunch of things, both within the budget plan itself and in the process surrounding it. I was talking about this with our State House reporter Katie Lannan earlier. We’re expecting Healey to devote some attention to, no surprise, the T. I won’t list all the disasters the T has dealt with this past year — there was one just this morning that caused power to go out across the whole system — but one big overarching issue that’s been the source of a lot of other problems is lack of staffing. Healey has said she wants to put money towards hiring 1,000 new workers for the T. Solving the staffing problem could be a real step in the right direction, but if Healey does indeed put a big chunk of money into hiring, there’s still the issue of actually attracting workers. The T has been running its own major hiring campaign the past several months, but the staffing shortage still persists. So we’ll see if more money can help solve it.Something else to look for is whether Healey keeps her pledge to put 1% of her budget to environmental agencies. And we’ll also find out if Healey holds true to the promise she made in her inaugural address to make community college free for folks 25 and older who don’t yet have a degree. Beyond just the numbers, the line items, we’ll see if there’s significant policy written into this spending plan. That would be a way for Healey to say, “This is a priority for me.”And then outside the budget itself and looking at the process, this is going to be an opportunity to really see how the new governor works with the Legislature. This is Healey’s first budget season. In the weeks ahead, the state Senate and the Massachusetts House will be coming out with their own proposed budgets, and leaders from both of those chambers and the governor will have to hammer out some sort of compromise. It’s yet to be seen whether that’ll be easy or hard, acrimonious or drama-free, but it’ll help set the tone for what Healey’s relationship with the Legislature is gonna be like for the next four years and how our state government is going to function.Rath: You mentioned staffing shortages with the T. Staffing shortages are also apparently behind the Essex County sheriff’s plan to drop the minimum hiring age for corrections officers — that’s jail guards — from 21 to 19. We heard a little bit about that yesterday, but we’re doing some follow-up reporting on that, right?Baskin: Yeah, you know, it's in process. Diego Lopez, senior producer for GBH's All Things Considered, spoke with Essex County sheriff Kevin Coppinger about this yesterday. Coppinger says that his office — like you mentioned, like the T, like so many businesses — is dealing with staffing issues, and lowering the hiring age is meant to deal with that. And he made the point that this isn’t necessarily unprecedented. He says his office has hired 19-year-olds in decades past, and that other county sheriffs in Massachusetts and across the country have too. I think the idea of 19-year-olds working a job like this doesn’t sit well with some people. These are still technically teenagers. A two-year difference might feel arbitrary to some, but corrections officers do a difficult job and they wield a lot of power over other people’s lives. So right now we’re checking in with other county sheriffs’ offices around the commonwealth — as well as the Massachusetts Department of Correction, which handles state-level prisons — to see what their minimum hiring age is. And we’re trying to speak with other professionals in law enforcement and with advocacy groups to get their take on whether this is a reasonable way to deal with staffing problems.Rath: Before you go, we’re still feeling some of the effects of the new government that's in place now. With Maura Healey taking office last month, we’ve recently had state Rep. Jon Santiago leave his seat in the House to serve in Healey’s cabinet. And, of course, Kim Driscoll left a void in Salem when she resigned as that city’s mayor to become lieutenant governor. What’s the state of things in Salem now? Baskin: I know we’re short on time, so real quick: there are five candidates in the running. I won’t name all of them, but the field includes the Salem city councilor who’s right now serving as acting mayor. There’s also Kim Driscoll’s chief of staff from when she ran the city. And there’s a former mayor of Salem who preceded Driscoll in office, back in the ’90s, and three decades later is coming back for more. The candidates are taking part in a mayoral forum this evening, which we’ll be covering, and Salem voters will narrow the field of five down to two in a preliminary election that’s scheduled for March 28, a month from today. And then there'll be a final election that’s scheduled for May 16. Rath: I guess we just can't get enough elctions. Matt, thank you.Baskin: Thank you Arun.",Local,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:02:44 EST",7f1bb8b612d37b3194c2d81963a2b29a

Stone delves into the potential of nuclear energy in his new documentary, “Nuclear Now.” The film, based on the book “A Bright Future” by Joshua Goldstein and Staffan Qvist, analyzes how nuclear energy can tackle climate change and energy poverty with footage of the nuclear industry in France, Russia and the United States.Stone, who has won multiple Oscars for Best Director, says that many people misunderstand nuclear energy. “I include myself,” he said. “I did not know [about the pros of nuclear energy] until I made the film and that was a way to educate myself.”Notions about nuclear are typically tied to nuclear war and atomic bombs. But the country was once on the path to accepting a nuclear society in the 1970s. President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Atoms for Peace program in 1953 and played a significant role in the development of nuclear energy. “We wouldn’t even be talking about climate change [today] because other countries would have followed. France followed us very closely, Sweden followed us, and Russia. They were all doing this [developing nuclear energy] in the 1970s,” Stone argued.But fear of nuclear may be changing. After a showing of his film, Stone recalled that young people came up to him to say that his work moved them and inspired them to want to take action. “They’re not as scared of nuclear war, which was a big issue in the ’50s and ’60s,” he said. “They’re less scared of that than climate change. And that’s important.” Despite the negative connotations, he says nuclear power is “nature’s gift” — and much safer than alternatives like coal, gas and oil. Many of the scientists featured in his documentary have a similarly positive view of nuclear energy, which currently generates nearly 20% of the electricity in the United States. “On the list of deaths when you check the chart in the film, nuclear is at the bottom,” Stone said. “There’s nothing compared to it.”",Local,"Wed, 03 May 2023 16:50:35 EST",ec6e75144b2c1b5ee4f4a60415f9b842

Most notably, the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Special Counsel found that Rollins tried to influence the election in which voters were choosing her successor as Suffolk County District Attorney. According to federal investigators, Rollins fed the press damaging details about one candidate, then-acting DA Kevin Hayden, including sensitive DOJ information; acted as a political adviser to the other candidate, Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo; and lied under oath about what she'd done. Rollins' resignation seems to rule out any additional penalties from the government.

Women can live in the home for free while they carry pregnancies. After their babies are born, they can stay for six months longer.Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the pugilistic state and federal legal battles that have followed have garnered all the attention. But another quieter story has played out for women in life-changing ways as the number of abortions has declined markedly.One group of researchers forecasts 60,000 fewer abortions in the year since abortion became largely illegal in much of the United States. These declines are in the states where pregnant women already faced the greatest risks of maternal mortality and poverty.For the women navigating these dangers, allies are hard to come by.

At 21, Faith packed her car for Los Angeles. She worked there in hospitality at some of the city's most breathtaking high-end hotels. She was the woman behind the front desk. ""I was good at it,"" she says. ""I loved it.""But last year, she met a man, also an aspiring musician, and threw herself into the relationship. Not long after, she says, she was feeling depressed, unsure where her music career was heading.With him, her life unraveled. She lost her apartment. They were soon homeless, bouncing from her car to motels. ""We would book the studio for music time and also sleep there,"" she explains. Her boyfriend told her he was a chef, but she became suspicious. He didn't work much.Faith realized how toxic the relationship was at just about the time she learned she was pregnant. The thought of entanglement with this man forever terrified her. ""My first thought was abortion,"" she says.But something held her back. She'd had an abortion a few years earlier. She still grieved that pregnancy. She felt certain it would have been a girl. She couldn't stop thinking about the child she might have had.""I don't live life with regrets,"" Faith says. ""I take on my choices. This is the one thing that I can't not regret. It's really heavy on my heart a lot of the time.""She called her mom back in Idaho. She recalls her mother saying that ""you can do this"" and that ""we'll figure it out. I think that you'll be a wonderful mom.""""I didn't know that that's what I needed to hear until she told me that.""Faith got rid of half her possessions and flew home. She still remembers the relief she felt that day as she watched LA recede in the distance, out the airplane window.But shortly after she got to Idaho, things began to fall apart there, as well. Her stepfather kicked her out of the house. She had already let keeping the pregnancy take root in her mind. It would be a girl, she thought. The thought of not having a place to bring her baby home to terrified her.That's when she walked into Robin Watters' crisis pregnancy center.Maternity homes are a solution the Christian right can supportBack in 2018, Watters read an article in a Christian publication. It posed a question: ""What would your state do if Roe v. Wade was overturned?"" At the time, that seemed like an outlandish possibility. But it got her thinking. ""Wouldn't a maternity home,"" she says, ""be the perfect answer?""There are more than 400 maternity homes across the U.S., according to the Maternity Housing Coalition, an umbrella advisory group. Many are associated with crisis pregnancy centers and — like the Nesting Place — a Christian ministry.Watters was already running a crisis pregnancy center called Lifeline Pregnancy Care Center when she began dreaming about building a maternity home. She'd seen hundreds of pregnant young women who needed a place to live and, she thought, would benefit from a relationship with the church. She pitched the idea to her board of directors. They went for it, and contractors were finishing renovations on the home that the center had purchased when the Supreme Court issued the decision that overturned Roe. The Nesting Place opened in February.Nampa, a bedroom suburb of Boise, is not a rich community, but Watters says support for this project is broad and deep. To renovate and staff the house, the organization doubled its budget to a half-million dollars annually. It's now working to build an endowment to finance the operation indefinitely without depending on year-to-year donations.Nearby churches are a primary means of financial support. On a recent day, Keith Wagner, an evangelical pastor, stopped by. It was the first time he'd seen the house since its completion. He seemed awed. ""Robin,"" he said, ""This is amazing!""Sitting in the living room minutes later, Wagner said last summer's Supreme Court decision ending the national right to abortion took the Christian right by surprise.""Their position has way too often been only defined by what they're against — 'I'm against abortion.'"" But Wagner says after the court victory, things changed. ""They had to say, 'Oh, hold on a second. OK. We've prayed for this. Now what are we going to do?'""This year, thousands of low-income women and those living in poverty will have babies in Idaho. And more than 7,000 women a year in Idaho are reliant on Medicaid to cover births. The state now has some of the more austere abortion laws in the country. It's the only state where people can be prosecuted and go to prison for helping a minor leave the state to get an abortion.Wagner says he encourages people in his congregation of 4,000 to consider adoption or foster-parenting. But that level of sacrifice isn't something many are ready to make. Supporting an organization like the Nesting Place gives people a way to put money behind words.Even in best-case scenarios, this kind of organization cannot give women all the resources they need for 18 or more years of parenting. ""They chose life,"" Wagner said, ""but it's expensive."" That's why he supports the organization's stated commitment to helping women build financial skills and learn a trade.Even then, people will fall through cracks.Maternity homes don't work for everyoneThings have not worked out for at least one person who came to the Nesting Place. Autumn Hendry, who's 29, found the organization when she was nine weeks pregnant. She says her circumstances felt insurmountable: homeless and struggling with substance abuse. Abortion seemed her best option.But when Hendry met with the staff members at the crisis pregnancy center, they laid out another path: move into the Nesting Place, get clean, have the baby. ""They made me feel really comfortable,"" she said. ""I was able to quit using.""She stopped using methamphetamines and alcohol for a few weeks and earned an overnight pass for good behavior. While she was away from the maternity home visiting a friend, she relapsed.Watters and Nesting Place staff worked to find Hendry in-patient treatment. She enrolled but then left. Now, she's 26 weeks pregnant, unable to stop using and has no place to live.She regrets not having the abortion. ""I don't want to be pregnant anymore,"" she says. ""But it's too late now.""Placing her baby for adoption seems like an obvious path for Hendry. But she has already been down that road. She describes the day several years ago when authorities took her 5-year-old son, Jacob, from school. Child abuse, they said.""The loss was so bad,"" she says. Talking about it is wrenching for her. After Jacob's removal, Hendry says, she ""dove hard into drugs.""She fought to get Jacob back, but after a few years she could see his life was improving in foster care. She made the excruciating decision to sign over her rights. ""I decided it was probably best for him.""When she thinks about adoption and this pregnancy, she relives that trauma.She's couch-surfing now. On a recent day, she was sitting outside a friend's house not sure whether he'd open the door for her.The Maternity Housing Coalition acknowledges that substance abuse is a growing issue for maternity homes like the Nesting Place. But these homes are not typically based on a medical model of recovery or equipped to provide in-patient treatment.""I knew drugs would be in the mix,"" says Watters, the executive director. ""I just didn't know where or how much."" The twin issues of homelessness and substance abuse surprised her. She had imagined clients differently.""I thought it was just like, 'Oh, someone's pregnant, but they have, you know, their parents aren't wanting them to be,'"" says Watters. ""Or they have no friends, or they need a job."" She feels bad for Hendry, but she can't let her come back while she's using drugs. The rules are in place for everyone's safety. ""These are choices she's making,"" she says.Research shows that women with substance use disorders are at greater risk for unplanned pregnancies. And nearly 20% of people who seek abortions are homeless, according to one study.Still, Watters sees Hendry's case as a kind of victory. She persuaded this young woman not to have an abortion. ""The outcomes in this ministry are so hard to see,"" Watters says. ""It can be years later.""Faith forges a new pathFaith stands in the kitchen of the Nesting Place, sorting a pile of paperwork. ""This is what I'm working on now."" She gestures to a paper calendar. The days are filled with activities offered by Christian support groups — one for single moms and another that includes instruction on using Christianity to change behaviors. Recently, she says she has found her way to a new faith.She's hopeful that six months after she has the baby, she'll be eligible for free or reduced housing through a program that helps participants build financial skills. She plans to start massage therapy school in a few weeks.The staff members at the house breeze in and out. This place is staffed 24 hours a day. There are only two pregnant women living here now, but the staff hopes to expand to four soon.Another potential resident, 18-year-old Auna, comes by for an interview and to look around.She is 25 weeks pregnant. There is no turning back now. ""This is happening,"" she says, telling the staff that she'll think about moving in.Auna asks to be identified only by her first name because she hasn't told her school or employer yet. She doesn't want people to know about her situation or that she considered getting an abortion and even made calls about getting an appointment in the neighboring state of Oregon.Ultimately, she decided against it. ""My mom's always raised me to believe that abortion's not OK. I didn't realize how much it stuck with me until I got pregnant."" She's finding out the gender soon, she says with an excited smile. Auna is still in high school.Faith is also feeling excited, among other emotions. She's grappling with what it will mean to be a single mom; she's lonely at times, carrying a pregnancy without a partner.She's also mad. She's not planning to ask her ex-boyfriend for help, afraid of what he might do. It's unfair, she says, how little this situation demands of the father of her child. As far as she knows, he's still in Los Angeles. ""He gets to be there and continue his music journey and do what he's doing.""She's only 25, Faith reminds herself. She imagines someday — maybe four or five years from now — driving back to Los Angeles to resume her dream of singing professionally, this time with her daughter in tow.""I'm just pressing pause right now.""

4247,"The Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspaper, changes hands after six decades",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/02/the-bay-state-banner-bostons-oldest-black-owned-newspaper-changes-hands-after-six-decades,The Banner’s new owners plan to expand multimedia content while promising to honor the paper’s legacy and mission.,"Running a local newspaper for more than half a century is no small feat, but Melvin Miller isn’t one to brag. “The question of legacy is always for other people to decide,” Miller said. “I’m just a ditch digger. I just do the work.” After nearly six decades, Miller says it’s time for someone new to take over his life’s work: the Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspape. Miller announced Wednesday he is handing the paper over to new owners as part of a larger expansion and redesign of the publication. The new owners, Ron Mitchell and Andre Stark, are veteran journalists with close ties to their Boston communities and long-standing family relationships with 88-year-old Miller, a Roxbury native. “We’re journalists, we’re filmmakers, but we’re also people who have been telling the truth about our community,” Mitchell said. “We’re going to take [The Banner] into the next half a century. We’re going to transition it in many different ways to make it more amenable to a younger audience.” Mitchell, 61, who previously worked at GBH News, resigned last week from a nearly 30-year career at WBZ-TV to prepare for his role as publisher and editor of the Banner, a return to his roots. Mitchell’s family — including his aunt Jean McGuire, a former METCO director — had generations of ties to the Miller family. “We are living up to the responsibility that our families birthed us into,” Mitchell said, “to take responsibility for the communication in our community.”Stark, 63, who will serve as the paper’s chief operating officer, is another GBH veteran who produced documentary films for PBS documentary series Frontline and NOVA. He serves as a board member at the Roxbury-based Center for Teen Empowerment, a nonprofit that provides resources to young people from local communities of color. Stark says he read the Banner as a child, the son of West-Indian parents who steeped him in Black cultural history and enrolled him in school at the Freedom House established by Otto and Muriel Snowden. His mother, a close friend of Miller’s, brought Stark to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s march from his Roxbury neighborhood to the Boston Common in 1965. “I think one of the reasons Mel felt comfortable transferring the mantle over to us is that he knows both of our families,” Stark said. “It helps close the circle as he knows both of us from years ago.” Kenneth Cooper, another GBH News veteran with decades of experience at newsrooms including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Dispatch, will join the Banner as an editorial consultant, overseeing a major expansion and transformation that lies ahead. Longtime Banner senior editor Yawu Miller has agreed to stay on (despite his uncle's departure) to manage the Boston edition of the paper. Financing for the transition came from private contributions from community members around Greater Boston and the Mill Cities Community Investment, a community development financial institution based in Lawrence. Both Miller and the new owners declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Within the next year, the Banner plans to distribute in other regional markets, including Connecticut, Rhode Island and Northern parts of Massachusetts, and positions will open for bureau chiefs in those areas, Mitchell said. The change of guard comes with plans for a new website and app, weekly 30-minute investigative news shows, wider coverage of sports and local business briefs. The expansion of online content will be overseen by Colin Redd, a 30-year-old Boston native who helps run Blavity, a Black-owned media company with an understanding of young audiences. The new website will include community services including access to loan applications, scholarships, a calendar of community events and other educational resources, Mitchell said. “It’s going to be an interactive resource, a portal of opportunities,” Mitchell said. “The website will be true community outreach, not just a physical rendition of the paper.” The goal, Mitchell says, is to reach new audiences and expand coverage while preserving the publication’s integrity as a source of local news for communities of color. “This is an extension of African-American culture going back hundreds of years, community storytelling that transformed into Black publishing,” Mitchell said. “Dating back to emancipation, Black papers told the truth about the Black community.” The Banner has always stood out as a source of straightforward information, Mitchell says, representing an on-the-ground approach to issues directly impacting communities of color. “The Black community is not a monolith,” he said. “That's why it is important to have a paper that understands the complexity of our community and tells us that's the only way you get the true story.”Miller founded the Banner in 1965 to fill a void left by the folding of The Guardian, a newspaper led by civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter. His goal was never objectivity — an idea he dismisses as “nonsense” — but to be fair and honest, and to help readers understand “the complexity of American society” with nuance and clarity. “People would come up to me sometimes and ask me why we didn’t cover some shooting, and I said, 'Hey, there are many places you can find that,'” Miller said. “I’m not going to spend ten cents of my budget giving any attention to a brutal government. Not going to happen.” Miller’s hope for the paper is the continuation of his work highlighting the fabric of life in communities of color, emphasizing “positive, helpful and uplifting” coverage whenever possible. “If we focus on the wrong things perpetually, then what we're doing is we are building that culture around those ideas, on the ugly angels,” Miller said. “I like to appeal to people’s beautiful angels.”",Local,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 07:07:13 EST",057a2b200ca4358fd493071b966389f9
3013,US government moves to stop potential banking crisis,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/13/us-government-moves-to-stop-potential-banking-crisis,"NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government took extraordinary steps Sunday to stop a potential banking crisis after the historic failure of Silicon Valley Bank, assuring all depositors at the failed institution that they could access all their money quickly, even as another major bank was shut down.","NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government took extraordinary steps Sunday to stop a potential banking crisis after the historic failure of Silicon Valley Bank, assuring all depositors at the failed institution that they could access all their money quickly, even as another major bank was shut down.The announcement came amid fears that the factors that caused the Santa Clara, California-based bank to fail could spread. Regulators had worked all weekend to try to find a buyer for the bank, which was the second-largest bank failure in history. Those efforts appeared to have failed Sunday.In a sign of how fast the financial bleeding was occurring, regulators announced that New York-based Signature Bank had also failed and was being seized on Sunday. At more than $110 billion in assets, Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.The near-financial crisis that U.S. regulators had to intervene to prevent left Asian markets jittery as trading began Monday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 1.6% in morning trading, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4%. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite increased 0.3%.In an effort to shore up confidence in the banking system, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC said Sunday that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be protected and able to access their money. They also announced steps that are intended to protect the bank's customers and prevent additional bank runs.""This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth,"" the agencies said in a joint statement.Under the plan, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including those whose holdings exceed the $250,000 insurance limit, will be able to access their money on Monday.Also Sunday, another beleaguered bank, First Republic Bank, announced that it had bolstered its financial health by gaining access to funding from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase.In a separate announcement, the Fed late Sunday announced an expansive emergency lending program that's intended to prevent a wave of bank runs that would threaten the stability of the banking system and the economy as a whole. Fed officials characterized the program as akin to what central banks have done for decades: Lend freely to the banking system so that customers would be confident that they could access their accounts whenever needed.The lending facility will allow banks that need to raise cash to pay depositors to borrow that money from the Fed, rather than having to sell Treasuries and other securities to raise the money. Silicon Valley Bank had been forced to dump some of its Treasuries at at a loss to fund its customers' withdrawals. Under the Fed's new program, banks can post those securities as collateral and borrow from the emergency facility.The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses incurred under the Fed's emergency lending facility. Fed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.Analysts said the Fed's program should be enough to calm financial markets on Monday.""Monday will surely be a stressful day for many in the regional banking sector, but today's action dramatically reduces the risk of further contagion,"" economists at Jefferies, an investment bank, said in a research note.Though Sunday's steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, its actions are relatively limited compared with what was done 15 years ago. The two failed banks themselves have not been rescued, and taxpayer money has not been provided to the banks.President Joe Biden said Sunday evening as he boarded Air Force One back to Washington that he would speak about the bank situation on Monday. In a statement, Biden also said he was ""firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess fully accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.""Regulators had to rush to close Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution with more than $200 billion in assets, on Friday when it experienced a traditional run on the bank where depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once. It is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind only the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual.Some prominent Silicon Valley executives feared that if Washington didn't rescue the failed bank, customers would make runs on other financial institutions in the coming days. Stock prices plunged over the last few days at other banks that cater to technology companies, including First Republic Bank and PacWest Bank.Among the bank's customers are a range of companies from California's wine industry, where many wineries rely on Silicon Valley Bank for loans, and technology startups devoted to combating climate change. Sunrun, which sells and leases solar energy systems, had less than $80 million of cash deposits with Silicon Valley. Stitchfix, the clothing retail website, disclosed recently that it had a credit line of up to $100 million with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders.Tiffany Dufu, founder and CEO of The Cru, a New York-based career coaching platform and community for women, posted a video Sunday on LinkedIn from an airport bathroom, saying the bank crisis was testing her resiliency. Given that her money was tied up at Silicon Valley Bank, she had to pay her employees out of her personal bank account. With two teenagers to support who will be heading to college, she said she was relieved to hear that the government's intent is to make depositors whole.""Small businesses and early-stage startups don't have a lot of access to leverage in a situation like this, and we're often in a very vulnerable position, particularly when we have to fight so hard to get the wires into your bank account to begin with, particularly for me, as a Black female founder,"" Dufu told The Associated Press.Silicon Valley Bank began its slide into insolvency when its customers, largely technology companies that needed cash as they struggled to get financing, started withdrawing their deposits. The bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals, leading to the largest failure of a U.S. financial institution since the height of the financial crisis.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed to rising interest rates, which have been increased by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, as the core problem for Silicon Valley Bank. Many of its assets, such as bonds or mortgage-backed securities, lost market value as rates climbed.Sheila Bair, who was chairwoman of the FDIC during the 2008 financial crisis, recalled that with nearly all the bank failures then, ""we sold a failed bank to a healthy bank. And usually, the healthy acquirer would also cover the uninsured because they wanted the franchise value of those large depositors so optimally, that's the best outcome.""But with Silicon Valley Bank, she told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""this was a liquidity failure, it was a bank run, so they didn't have time to prepare to market the bank. So they're having to do that now, and playing catch-up.""___Rugaber and Megerian reported from Washington.

320,Photographer Aïda Muluneh created public art for Boston's bus stops,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/photographer-aida-muluneh-created-public-art-for-bostons-bus-stops,Her exhibit is part of a global public art project.,"The other day, I was walking near a bus stop by the Common when I saw something interesting: At the bus stop, in that usual spot where you'd see an ad, there was this big, vibrant piece of art.But it wasn't actually a painting. It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: Aïda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. She’s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa. The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called “This is Where I Am.”“I have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,” Muluneh said. “I think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.”Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery. Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said. “I know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,” she said. “For those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.”She brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props. “I utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,” Muluneh said. “It's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.”This project is the first time in her career that she’s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square. “I liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,” Muluneh said. “To try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style. She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art. “It's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,” Muluneh said. “I enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.”",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:07:11 EST",12b2470c97737347d09baaf3708aee2a
2246,"Meet Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, Uganda's first wildlife vet and a renowned conservationist",https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2023/05/05/meet-gladys-kalema-zikusoka-ugandas-first-wildlife-vet-and-a-renowned-conservationist,"When she came eye-to-eye with a gorilla for the first time, she felt an ""instant connection.""","Countless natural disasters made worse from climate change and the degradation of our natural world feel like a steady drumbeat in the news. It’s hard not to feel discouraged, especially when we hear about the enormous amount of species that have gone extinct due to climate change and human activity. But there is hope.This week’s edition of the Joy Beat celebrates the hard work and dedication of a world-class conservationist and wildlife veterinarian: Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka. She’s the founder and CEO of the grassroots non-governmental organization Conservation Through Public Health, and her new memoir dives into her career caring for Uganda’s mountain gorillas. She joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath.Arun Rath: First off, tell us about how you first got involved in conservation efforts in Uganda. I believe you started quite young, right? Dr. Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka: Yes. I first got involved in conservation efforts when I revived a wildlife club at my high school in Uganda. I was very excited to go to the national parks. But when I saw that there was very little wildlife because it had been culled during the President Idi Amin era, I thought that I should become a veterinarian who works with wildlife. I’d grown up with so many pets at home, and I really wanted to be a vet by the age of two. But by the age of 18, I felt like I wanted to be a vet that works with wildlife. Then, I got an opportunity to work with captive chimpanzees, and then I also got to work with chimpanzees in the wild and, finally, with mountain gorillas in the national park, one year after gorilla tourism had just begun. And I became Uganda’s first wildlife vet. Rath: Tell us a bit more about your first encounter with gorillas and how you came to become enamored with these animals. Kalema-Zikusoka: My first encounter with gorillas was really exciting. First of all, it took me a week before I could see them because I developed a nasty cold. But once I got better, we went to visit them, and that day we only saw one gorilla. We could be within five meters of distance with him. I looked into his eyes, and it was a really deep connection. They’re very intelligent. I felt that they were so vulnerable, and we need to do something to protect them. At that time, there were so few left in the world, and that made me feel like I wanted to be a full-time wildlife veterinarian because I felt we needed to do something to prevent them from going extinct. Rath: It’s interesting because Uganda has such fantastic natural beauty and wildlife, but you just reminded me in this conversation that we’re talking about the post-Idi Amin period when the wildlife had not been taken care of. Talk about what the situation was and how the country had recovered in terms of the natural landscape. Kalema-Zikusoka: During the Idi Amin era, the president himself was hunting elephants in the national parks. The national parks were supposed to be a safe haven for wildlife. The wardens tried to stop it, but eventually, they couldn’t anymore, so elephant poaching went up. Later, when the army overthrew Idi Amin, some of the soldiers also ate meat from the forests and the national parks, so a lot of numbers went down, and the elephants and rhinos were pushed to extinction. Then, in 1987, mountain gorillas were discovered. They thought the only population was in the Virunga Mountains, but suddenly, in ‘87, after doing genetic studies, they found out that there is a second population. Having seen how Rwanda was benefiting from mountain gorilla tourism, Uganda started to habituate them, and a few years later, tourism began. That completely transformed the situation in Uganda because gorilla tourism is now raising so much revenue that some of it was going to support the other national parks that don’t get enough tourists because they don’t have enough wildlife or it’s not easy to get to the wildlife. It really transformed the landscape. When I first started working with gorillas, there were only two groups habituated for tourism. Now, there’s 22 groups. So at any one time, you can have almost 180 people in the park, whereas before, there were only 12 people. It’s transformed people’s lives. Most people employed by the park are from the local communities, and we are also engaging them in our nonprofit, so it’s really transforming the whole area. Rath: My next question was going to be about how your NGO, Conservation Through Public Health, and how public health ties into wildlife conservation. But I feel like you gave us a bit of a preview on that. Talk about that some more. Kalema-Zikusoka: Actually, one of the very first cases I had to deal with as Uganda’s first wildlife vet working for the national parks, which later became the Uganda Wildlife Authority, was a skin disease outbreak on the then-critically endangered mountain gorillas. They called me and said the gorillas are developing white, scaly skin. So I wondered what it could be, and a human doctor friend of mine told me the most common skin disease in people is scabies. So I went with a drug called ivermectin, which is very good for any parasites. When we got there, it turned out to be scabies. The baby gorilla had sadly died, but the others recovered with treatment. Their hair started to grow back and stop scratching. We started asking ourselves, “Where could this have come from?” The two groups habituated for tourism was spending a lot of time outside the national park because their habitat had been cut down, and they were always going out to look for banana plants. It had been cut down because of the high human population density. We found that those people were very poor and they had very little health care. When we met with them, they said they wanted to improve the situation because they don’t want to make the gorillas sick, and they wanted to be more healthy and have better well-being. This made me realize you can’t protect the gorillas and their habitat without improving the health and well-being of the people who they share their fragile habitats with. A few years later, we founded Conservation Through Public Health. I did research looking at tuberculosis in people, wildlife and livestock, and I understood how the public health system works in Uganda. All of this information helped us to found Conversation Through Public Health. Rath: As I mentioned at the top, it seems like most of what we hear about wildlife and conservation is typically bad or terrible news — almost panicking. It’s nice to be able to talk to you about hopeful stories like this, about how wildlife can rebound. Can I ask you for any additional hope? Are there ways in which what you’ve accomplished in Uganda could apply in other places? Are there other ways that we could do what you’ve been able to pull off there? Kalema-Zikusoka: Actually, we have found that as the health of the community is improving, people are not poaching as much. We show them that we care about them and their health, which is a basic human right, and not only about the wildlife and the forests. We’re very excited about that. Tourism has also helped. Communities are much happier. I’ll say that there are other countries in Africa where the numbers of gorilla species are going down, but the mountain gorilla population has almost doubled over the past 25 years and is still growing, which is exciting. In other countries in Africa, where there are no community benefits, there isn’t much support for communities — there’s still a lot of hunting. This particular model could really work, and it could also work in other areas with other wildlife. I’ve actually been speaking at the Wilson Center today, and the very question they asked was like this. They said, “We would love to scale up our approach to other parts of the world.”",International News,"Fri, 05 May 2023 17:58:16 EST",6b89f7f6e0cc1d83068b0e2639dcda9d
1566,Cicada Coffee Bar’s Vinh Le lives in the moment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/cicada-coffee-bars-vinh-le-lives-in-the-moment,"The new Cambridge restaurant is a popular space to eat and connect, thanks in part to its welcoming owners.","It was summer in Vermont and the sound of cicadas droned through the woods. This insect song was the inspiration Vinh Le needed to open his first restaurant space.“Cicada is summer,” Le, the co-owner of Cicada Coffee Bar, told Boston Public Radio at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday. “Cicadas remind me about my childhood, about the times I relaxed.” Vinh Le and his life and business partner Duong Huynh, have created a restaurant at 106 Prospect St. that doubles as a community space, where patrons can slow down, connect and share food and drinks in the heart of Cambridge. Ten years ago, Le left Vietnam for the U.S. to attend architecture school at Columbia University. During the pandemic, Le’s life slowed down and he decided he wanted to open a restaurant. But not just any restaurant — he wanted every aspect of the space to be tailored to the Cambridge community. The funky lighting, the handmade plates and the mid-century modern furniture are all designed with Cambridge tastes in mind. Customers might recognize the mid-century modern chairs from their grandmother’s house, Le said. Once in Cicada’s cozy interior (after braving the line that often stacks up outside the restaurant), people consume locally sourced drinks and food inspired by Le’s home country. Vietnamese food is defined by lots of fresh ingredients and herbs, Le said. The menu includes fresh summer rolls filled with vegetables, sushi rice with salmon and mushrooms, banh mi sandwiches and noodle salad with charred eggplant. The coffee is not to be missed. The sea salt shaker is the signature drink made with coffee, sea salt and condensed milk. All the ingredients are shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker to create a frothy, milkshake-like beverage. “This is my performance,” said Le, as he showed off his bartending skills and poured iced coffee for hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan.Vietnamese started using condensed milk in their coffee during the Vietnam War, said Le, when they didn’t have access to fresh milk. In addition to sweet caffeine, Cicada serves hot tea brewed with fresh ginger and lemongrass, plus homemade hot sauce. Le's innovation has been recognized, it was announced in January that he is a semifinalist for the Emerging Chef James Beard Award. The short list of James Beard Award nominees will be announced Mar. 29. When asked whether the nomination puts a burden on his shoulders, Le said he wasn’t bothered. He plans to continue cooking and creating community at Cicada no matter what happens. Still, he acknowledged it’s still stressful owning and operating a new restaurant. But this stress leads to hard work and creativity, said Le. To balance the stress Le said he practices living in the moment, whether it is cooking food or picking up a shift for a sick coworker. BPR host Jim Braude asked Le’s partner Huynh, standing just off stage, whether that is true. “He tries every other moment to live in the moment,” said Huynh, with a laugh.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:21:24 EST",9bd39d410f7cfcb8d9b51ce1cf520c4a
6334,So your tween wants a smartphone? Read this first,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/12/so-your-tween-wants-a-smartphone-read-this-first,Your tween wants a smartphone very badly. So badly that it physically hurts. And they're giving you soooo many reasons why.,"Your tween wants a smartphone very badly. So badly that it physically hurts. And they're giving you soooo many reasons why. They're going to middle school ... they need it to collaborate with peers on school projects ... they need it to tell you where they are ... when they'll be home ... when the school bus is late. It'll help you, dear parent, they vow. Plus, all their friends have one, and they feel left out. Come on! Pleeeeeeze.Before you click ""place order"" on that smartphone, pause and consider a few insights from a person who makes a living helping parents and tweens navigate the murky waters of smartphones and social media.Emily Cherkin spent more than a decade as a middle school teacher during the early aughts. She watched first-hand as the presence of smartphones transformed life for middle schoolers. For the past four years, she's been working as screen-time consultant, coaching parents about digital technology. Her first piece of advice about when to give a child a smartphone and allow them to access social media was reiterated by other experts over and over again: Delay, delay, delay. 'I wish I knew then what I know now'""I have talked to hundreds of parents,"" Cherkin explains, ""and no one has ever said to me, 'I wish I gave my kid a phone earlier or I wish I'd given them social media access sooner. Never.""In fact, parents tell her the opposite. ""I always hear, 'I wish I had waited. I wish I knew then what I know now,' "" she says, ""because boy, once you give a child one of these devices or technologies, it is so much harder to take it back.""Smartphones, social media, and video games create large spikes in dopamine deep inside a child's brain. As NPR has reported, those spikes pull the child's attention to the device or app, almost like a magnet. They tell the child's brain that this activity is super critical – way more critical than other activities that trigger smaller spikes in dopamine, such as finishing homework, helping to clean up after dinner, or even playing outside with friends.Thus, parents set themselves up for a constant struggle when a child starts having their own smartphone, Cherkin says. ""It's the dopamine you're fighting. And that's not a fair fight. So I tell parents, 'Delay all of it just as long as you can,'"" she emphasizes.That means delaying, not just a smartphone, but any device, including tablets, she suggests. By introducing a tablet at an early age, even for educational purposes, parents can establish a habit that may be hard to break later, Cherkin has observed. ""A child using a tablet at age 6 to 8 comes to expect screen time after school,"" she says. ""Flash forward to age 12, and now they have a phone. And when they come home from school, they're likely engaging with social media, instead of educational videos."" Neurologically children's brains haven't developed enough to handle the magnetic pull of these devices and the apps on them, says neuroscientist Anne-Noël Samaha at the University of Montreal. ""It's almost as if you have the perfect storm,"" Samaha explains. ""You have games, social media, and even pornography and shopping online, and the brains of children are just not yet ready to have the level of self-control needed to regulate their behavior with these activities. Even adults sometimes don't have enough self-control to do that or handle some of the emotional impact of them.""Right-size your parenting fearsParents often feel like once their tween starts moving around more autonomously through their neighborhood or town more, the child needs a smartphone to be safe, Cherkin says. ""They may think, 'Oh, my gosh! My kid is going to be kidnapped on the way to school. They need a phone to call me.' But Cherkin notes that parents tend to overestimate the dangers of the ""real world."" and underestimate the dangers of a smartphone. ""I think our fears are very misplaced,"" she says. ""We need to think about what is statistically really likely to happen versus what's really, really unlikely.""Each year in the U.S. about a hundred children are abducted by strangers or people or slight acquaintances, the U.S. Department of Justice reported. Given that 50 million children, ages 6 to 17, reside in the U.S, the risk of a child being kidnapped by a stranger is about 0.0002% each year. (By comparison, the risk of being struck by lightning each year is about 0.0001%.) On the other hand, giving a child a phone comes with a whole new set of risks and dangers, Cherkin says. They can be difficult for some parents to understand because they may not have much first-hand experience with specific apps, and the new threats that are emerging. Back in March, the nonprofit Common Sense Media surveyed about 1,300 girls, ages 11 to 15, about their experiences on social media. Nearly 60% of the girls who use Instagram, and nearly 60% of those who use Snapchat, said they had been contacted by a stranger that makes them uncomfortable. The same was true for 46% of those who use TikTok. Disturbing online encounters and influencesThe same survey found that these apps often expose girls to content they find disturbing or harmful. For those that use Instagram, TikTok or Snapchat, 12% to 15% of girls see or hear content related to suicide, on a daily basis. About the same percentage also said they see or hear content about eating disorders, on a daily basis as well.An investigation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate also found evidence that content related to suicide and disordered eating is relatively common on TikTok. In the investigation, the nonprofit set up eight accounts ostensibly by 13-year-old children. Each user paused on and liked videos about body image and mental health. Within 30 minutes, TikTok recommended content about suicide and eating disorders to all eight accounts. In one instance, this content began appearing in less than three minutes. On average, TikTok suggested content about eating disorders every 4 minutes to the teen accounts.TikTok declined NPR's request for an interview, but in an email, a spokesperson for the company wrote: ""We're committed to building age-appropriate experiences, while equipping parents with tools, like Family Pairing, to support their teen's experience on TikTok."" Emma Lembke, age 20, says these findings line up with what she experienced when she first went on Instagram eight years ago. ""As a 12-year-old girl, I felt like I was being constantly bombarded by bodies that I could never replicate or ones that I could try to, but it would lead me in a darker direction.""She remembers just trying to look up a healthy recipe. ""And from that one search, I remember being fed constant stuff about my '200-calorie day' or intermittent fasting.""Eventually she says, her feed was ""covered with anorexic, thin, tiny women. Dieting pills, lollipops to suppress my appetite."" Lembke developed an eating disorder. She has recovered, and now is a digital advocate and founder of the Log OFF project, which helps teens build healthier relationships with social media. ""When I was younger, I was being prodded and poked and fed material [on social media] that was really leading me in a direction toward an eating disorder,"" she says. ""I think for a lot of young women, even if it doesn't materialize into a fully fledged eating disorder, it painfully warps their sense of self by harming their body image. ""Instagram's parent company, Meta, declined a request for an interview. But in an email, a spokesperson said the company has invested in technology that finds and removes content related to suicide, self-injury or eating disorders before anyone reports it. ""We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we're doing to provide teens with safe, supportive experiences online,"" they wrote. A whole world of sexually explicit contentMany children also come across sexualized content, even porn, on social media apps, Cherkin says. If you want to get a sense for what your kid might encounter once you let them have a phone and popular apps, Cherkin recommends trying this: Set up a test account in one of the apps, setting the age of the user to your child's age, and then use the account yourself for a few weeks. ""I did that with Snapchat. I set up an account, pretending to be 15. Then I just went to the Discover feed, where it pushes content to you based on your age,"" she explains. Within seconds, sexualized content and vulgar images appeared, she says. ""And I thought, 'No, this is not appropriate for a 15-year-old.""Snapchat's parent company, Snap, also declined a request for an interview with NPR. A spokesperson wrote in an email: ""We have largely kept misinformation, hate speech, and other potentially harmful content from spreading on Snapchat. That said, we completely understand concerns about the appropriateness of the content that may be featured, and are working to strengthen protections for teens with the aim of offering them a more age-appropriate experience."" Personally, Cherkin uses Instagram for her business. And back in March, despite all her knowledge about the traps on social media, she says she ""got catfished."" She engaged with a stranger who seemed to be a teen in her DMs, and eventually received obscene and disturbing photos of a man's genitalia. She writes on her blog: ""It's graphic. It's gross. And this is one teeny (lol) example of what kids and teens see ALL THE TIME."" What's a parent to do? Consider smartphone alternativesIn the end, Cherkin says, there are several other in-between options for tweens besides giving them their own smartphone or denying them a phone altogether. You can:Share your phone with your tween so they can text with and call friends. Give your tween a ""dumb phone"" that only allows texting and calling. For example, buy an old-school flip phone. But if that's out of the question because it's not cool enough (and you have extra cash to spare), you can now buy dumb phones that look like smartphones but have extremely limited functions – no easy-access to the internet, no social media. And very little risk of inappropriate content. Try to limit the apps your child uses – but get ready to be busy monitoring themIf you do end up getting your tween a smart phone, Cherkin says, you might be tempted to simply ""block"" children from downloading particular apps on their phones. And in theory, this works. Parental control apps, such as Bark, can notify you when an app is installed. But, she says, many kids find workarounds to this approach – and really any parental controls. For instance, she says, if you block Instagram on their phone, kids can login via the web. If you block TikTok, they might watch Tiktok videos in Pinterest. Kids can find porn on Spotify.""Kids are way tech savvier than we are,"" Cherkin wrote in an email. ""Remember how we used to program the VCR for our parents?! Every single parent who comes to me for help has a variation of this same story: 'We had X parental controls; we blocked X sites; our child figured out how to access them anyway.' ... It's impossible to successfully block everything — and once you do, a replacement will pop up in its place.""In other words, once you give your child a smartphone, you will likely be setting up yourself for a whole new series of parenting tasks and worries. Even Meta reveals this in its April ad for their parental controls: The mom in the ad is monitoring her son's Instagram account while doing the dishes.

2376,COVID public health emergencies have ended. Here’s what medical experts think,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/11/covid-public-health-emergencies-have-ended-heres-what-medical-experts-think,"The pandemic ""weakened the health of Black and brown communities already,"" one doctor says.","Tufts Medical Center hit a symbolic milestone in its main Boston hospital in Chinatown last week: For the first time in more than three years in the pandemic they had zero COVID-19 patients.It lasted for just one day, but it had a big impact, said Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for the Tufts Medicine Health System, who became a familiar voice in local news reports during the pandemic’s early days.She said administrators at Tufts got emotional when they heard that news.“[They had] tears in their eyes,” Doron said. “I mean, just think about where we were. The onslaught right from the first patient, which was March 21, 2020, ramping up so fast, opening another ICU and another ICU and another ICU, trying to find ventilators, no PPE, no hand sanitizer. I mean, hideous. It was just like, where else are you going to hit us, and how high is this going to go? We didn't know. And to have zero? Pretty awesome.”COVID-19 public health emergencies on both the federal and state levels came to an end Thursday, bringing both practical and symbolic changes to life in the pandemic. For instance, mandatory masking is gone in many health care settings.But COVID still circulates. In the last week of April, there were 14 confirmed and two probable deaths attributed to the virus. As the public’s perception of the virus has changed, so has the way public health professionals view it.Doron said now she'll be treating COVID-19 like other respiratory viruses, which can still be dangerous, but not as an unpredictably deadly agent from those days in the spring of 2020 that led to long-term shutdowns of schools and businesses.One major change has been in immunity: Three and a half years after the virus’ emergence, most people have some immunity from a vaccine, a prior infection or a combination of the two.Researchers are still studying how long immunity lasts and what it means for infection levels. But the death rate has dropped significantly, thanks to immunity levels, other mitigations like masking and better treatments for infected people at high risk. “We know that it was probably on the order of 10 to 100 times more deadly than flu,” said Stephen Kissler, an immunology and infectious diseases researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Now, it's probably on the order of like, 2 to 4 times, maybe. And that's a huge difference, right? That is a huge drop.”That significant drop has changed the way scientists think about the virus, he said.“I think it is a big driver of this change in the way that we talk about the pandemic as now ending this emergency of international concern,” Kissler said.Many people are back to some semblance of normal life. Still, the pandemic has left a lasting mark: More than 22,000 people in Massachusetts have died; Others have dealt with grieving lost loved ones, with the stress and trauma of the pandemic, and with lasting long COVID-19 symptoms.The fault lines of disparity that were revealed and deepened by the pandemic are not over. The damage done in some vulnerable communities continues, said Boston Medical Center infectious disease physician Dr. Cassandra Pierre, associate medical director, associate hospital epidemiologist and medical director of public health programs.Life expectancy went down disproportionately for Massachusetts residents of color during the pandemic compared with white residents, Pierre said.“I would say COVID-19 has probably weakened the health of Black and brown communities already,” Pierre said. “And so how much worse is it going to get once we pull back these resources, pull back these mitigation methods and measures, and have no idea what's actually happening in the communities that have been most structurally vulnerable? And what does that look like when we enter the next pandemic?”Even with ongoing concerns, Pierre said she thinks it is a good moment to end the public health emergency — but we shouldn't let down our guard, especially when it comes to people who are medically or socially vulnerable. She also pointed out that Black and brown people in the vulnerable communities that her hospital serves are still more at risk for getting COVID-19, more at risk for getting a severe case if they are infected and more at risk for Long Covid.Pierre said she'll be watching what may be the best metric: COVID-19 wastewater levels, and particularly the neighborhood-level data for the more vulnerable communities that BMC serves: Roxbury, Mattapan, the South End, Hyde Park and southeast parts of Boston. She said they'll be trying to adjust to any worrying and changing conditions as they crop up, even without an emergency declaration to back them up.",Local,"Thu, 11 May 2023 11:59:28 EST",689b4f956a6e0a6b6bedebea68d3d9dc
1596,"Potential 2024 ballot questions: rent control, voting rights, psychedelics and more",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/08/03/potential-2024-ballot-questions-rent-control-voting-rights-psychedelics-and-more,Attorney General Andrea Campbell will announce next month which ones can move forward.,"The 2024 state election is still more than a year away, but the portion of the ballot that asks voters to weigh in on various policy proposals is starting to come into focus. Eighteen groups filed 38 proposed laws and four proposed amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution by a Wednesday deadline, the first step in a long path toward putting their ideas before voters as ballot questions. Broadly, the topics range from education policy to legislative transparency to voting rights. Some specific proposals seek to formally establish the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples Day in Massachusetts, raise the minimum wage for tipped workers, suspend the state’s gas tax if fuel prices cross a certain threshold, and decriminalize natural psychedelic substances like psilocybin mushrooms. Attorney General Andrea Campbell plans to announce on Sept. 6 which proposals filed with her office are constitutionally valid. The backers of those petitions, if they’re seeking to place a potential law on the 2024 ballot, will then need to gather and file the signatures of more than 75,000 registered voters by Dec. 6. The groups proposing constitutional amendments, which need to be twice-approved by the Legislature, are working toward the 2026 ballot. Here’s a look at some of the issues that could wind up on the 2024 ballot. Massachusetts voters passed a statewide ban on rent control in 1994. As cities like Boston pursue a winding path through the Legislature to try to impose local rent-stabilization policies, one state lawmaker is hoping to take the concept to voters once again. Cambridge Democrat Rep. Mike Connolly, who said he was acting in his “personal capacity as a renter,” filed a petition that would lift the ban and revive rent control as an option for cities and towns that choose to adopt it.An industry-backed coalition that wants to ensure drivers for platforms like Uber and Lyft retain their status as independent contractors is back for round two. But this time, organized labor is in the mix with its own question. The Supreme Judicial Court struck from last year’s ballot a question that would have written into law that the drivers are contractors rather than employees, leaving unsettled a fight that’s been simmering for years on Beacon Hill about the drivers’ status, rights and benefits. This year, the coalition filed nine versions of their question, trying to find the right language to fend off a potential court challenge. Backers of the question say contractor status allows for the independence that many drivers prize, while opponents say it denies them the rights and benefits guaranteed to employees.The labor union 32BJ SEIU, meanwhile, put forward its own question that would allow the drivers to unionize, with the goal of being able to negotiate their working conditions.Another union with its sights on the 2024 ballot is the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which for years has been calling for changes to the state’s MCAS assessments. The MTA backs a question that would end the use of MCAS tests as a high school graduation requirement, and its board plans to decide at a Sunday meeting whether to launch a full union campaign in support of the initiative. A similar question was also filed by a Lexington mom. Critics of the MCAS say using the exam as a graduation requirement can be punitive, especially to students with special needs or those from marginalized groups. Supporters say it’s a crucial tool for ensuring uniform standards across districts and tracking whether students are getting the instruction they need. Petitioners filed eight different versions of a question that would require voters to show an ID at the polls. A similar proposal, which was backed by the Massachusetts Republican Party, failed to make last year’s ballot after its supporters didn’t gather enough signatures. Other election-related questions would expand voter registration options and create a non-partisan election system where the top five candidates of any party advance after a preliminary contest for state-level and Congressional elections. One of the constitutional amendments eyed for 2026 would restore voting rights to Massachusetts citizens incarcerated for felony offenses. That would effectively reverse an amendment voters approved in 2000 that prohibited people from voting while in prison serving felony sentences. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio and top lawmakers have for months been in a standoff over whether DiZoglio has the authority to audit the Legislature. House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka say it would violate the state Constitution, while DiZoglio maintains that an audit would boost transparency in a body she’s described as a “closed-door operation.”DiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat, last week requested AG Campbell’s support in bringing the matter to court, and now she’s backing that up with a ballot campaign as well. DiZoglio is one of the petitioners on an initiative that would expressly authorize her office to audit the Legislature.",Politics,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:27:31 EST",74b296a9bbcaef40521397d34133a464
7309,Rural schools urge Healey for more aid,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/02/22/rural-schools-urge-healey-for-more-aid,Charlemont and Hawley are pushing for the governor's first budget to include an extra $60 million in funding.,"Officials from the Western Massachusetts towns of Charlemont and Hawley sent Gov. Maura Healey a letter pushing for an extra $60 million in funding for rural districts and schools with declining enrollment. “Now is the time to act. The state has considerable existing resources, as well as expected revenues from the ‘Fair Share Amendment.’ Our small towns do not,” Hawlemont School Committee Chair Kenneth Bertsch wrote, referring to a new state tax on high-earners. “We have economized and provided strong, local support for our schools, but we need more help.”The request would increase spending for rural schools from $4 million currently to $60 million. Healey is expected to unveil her first annual budget proposal as governor next week.The Mohawk Trail Regional School District covers 250 square miles, and lost 40% of its enrollment between 2000 and 2018. Mohawk Trail School Committee Chair Martha Thurber said the state's funding formula, which is based on the number of students enrolled in a district, does not reflect the fixed costs to heat, electrify and maintain its school buidings despite having fewer students. “We have cut, scraped and consolidated. We've closed schools, but we are still in deep financial distress,” Thurber said. ""We are saying it's time to actually do something and fund this appropriately.”A similar problem has plagued the Boston Public Schools, the state's most populous school district. As enrollment has declined in recent years, the city of Boston has had to allocate tens of millions annually to help the district cover the shortfall and keep schools with empty seats in operation.Bertsch said he wants to see state legislators work to ensure that rural districts get the help they need from state coffers.“The reason we sent this letter right now is that the governor is finalizing her budget,” he said. “It’s the time for them to voice their opinion.”",Education,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 18:09:22 EST",b4e5f567a7e84b1b8e6133983381e3fd

(AP) — The start of a winter storm with heavy, wet snow caused a plane to slide off a taxiway and led to hundreds of school closings, canceled flights and thousands of power outages in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday.The storm's path included parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Snow totals by the time it winds up Wednesday were expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.“This is shaping up to be a unique winter storm for our small state in that there will be big differences in snowfall amounts depending on where you are located,” said Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, who ordered all executive branch state office buildings closed. “Some towns may receive a significant snowfall total, while others may receive a fraction of that amount or maybe even just rain.”A Delta Air Lines plane veered off a paved surface as it taxied for takeoff from a Syracuse, New York, airport Tuesday morning. Flight 1718, which was bound for New York City’s LaGuardia Airport, slid into a grassy area north of the runway, forcing 61 passengers off the plane and onto buses back to the terminal, according to airport officials. No one was injured and the airport remained open.“During a departure taxi-out this morning, the nose gear of a Delta aircraft exited the paved surface of a taxiway,” Delta said in a statement. “This was not an airplane skidding off a runway.”Delta said the plane carried 58 customers and a flight crew of five.More than 400 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.The National Weather Service said that in New York 2 inches of snow per hour or more was falling in higher elevations, in the eastern Catskills through the mid-Hudson Valley, central Taconics and Berkshires.Wet, heavy snow snapped tree branches and downed power lines across New York’s capital region with power outages hitting homes and businesses in the Albany area. Snow was falling especially heavy in New York’s Catskills, where about 20 inches have piled up in some areas — and more to come, according to the National Weather Service in Albany.The snowfall totals will be among the highest of the season, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the weather service office in College Park, Maryland.“It has been below average for snowfall across the Northeast this year, and so this nor'easter will be very impactful,"" he said.While higher elevations get snow, authorities warned residents in coastal areas to watch for possible flooding because of heavy rains. The National Weather Service in New York said wind gusts could reach 50 mph across Long Island and lower Connecticut.Rain was turning into snow across parts of New England with winds picking up and power outages reported across the region. In New Hampshire, it was Election Day for town officeholders, but more than 70 communities postponed voting because of the storm.One community that did not postpone voting was Londonderry, a town of about 24,000 people in the southern part of the state, where steady snow was falling. The polls had opened at 6 a.m. and were scheduled to close at 8 p.m.Many voters opted to turn in an absentee ballot Monday, in advance of the storm, town moderator Jonathan Kipp said. Some diehard residents braved the elements.“Some are like, ‘Hey, this is New England, you know, what do you expect?’ And others are not happy with the decision, but they still came out,” he said.In Connecticut, state government offices and courts were closed Tuesday. State offices were also closed in New York, which also cancelled legislative sessions because of the storm.The weather service said expected snow totals from the storm, which is forecast to wind up Wednesday, range from a foot to 18 inches in higher elevations in Massachusetts, to 4 to 6 inches in Boston.

That number is even higher, according to the Massachusetts Library Association's own survey, which reported 78 formal and informal challenges to books and programming last year. The surge in attempts to restrict access to library materials has alarmed free speech advocates, led to new legislation at the State House, and brought renewed attention to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling about censorship in schools.The towns of Dighton, Ludlow and Sturbridge have all been on the receiving end. Most of those attempts were to censor materials or library programming about race and sexuality — the same topics that vocal conservative groups have for years sought to limit.Discussions bubbled up in Dighton after the public library promoted ""Seeing Gender,"" a book about gender identity and expression. Community members met with library officials and also lined up at a board of trustees meeting to argue that ""sexual"" and ""politically inflammatory"" books should be separated from where children may see them. In Ludlow, a controversial proposal to alter the types of books and media allowed in school libraries, and to shift decision-making away from librarians and to the school committee, generated significant debate before the town's school committee ultimately voted against it last month. During a school committee meeting in May, Ludlow parent Bella Soares spoke in favor of the proposed policy change and pushed back against criticism that removing books would discriminate against students who identify as LGBTQ+.“Get this all through your heads,"" Soares said. ""You guys are the ones that are making it [about] LGBTQ. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with pornographic books in our school — drugs, rape, obscenity books. That's what we're trying to eliminate here.”And in Sturbridge, frustration over a public library-hosted event with a drag queen prompted critics to ask the Town Meeting to defund the library.James Lonergan, director of the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, said it’s a difficult time for library staff. He’s had library directors call him in tears from harassment.“They're trying to do good work. They're public servants. And frankly, they're being called names, or their ethics are being questioned,” Lonergan said.Ruth Bourquin, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the issue over what’s appropriate for school content is coming from a small number of conservative groups that describe themselves as defending parental rights and protecting children.“There's an uptick because there's a very well organized minority of people who seem to think they have nothing better to do with their lives but to try to control what other people's children can read in school libraries,” Bourquin said.Bourquin said all the arguments about free speech and parental control being used today hearken back to a decades-old U.S. Supreme Court case.In that 1982 decision, Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District v. Pico, the high court held that the First Amendment limits the power of school libraries to remove books because of their content. It was the first time — and still the only time — the Supreme Court heard a case about censorship in school libraries.For Steven Pico, the lead plaintiff in the case, today’s efforts to ban books are eerily similar to those he experienced over 40 years ago.""They call the case the 'Pico' case, which is very interesting, which is why I take it very personally,"" Pico told GBH News.The case originated in 1977, when he was a 17-year-old high school student in Levittown, New York. A parent's group had complained about 11 books in the school district's libraries, including Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” and Langston Hughes’s “Best Short Stories by Negro Writers.” The school board then removed the contested books from library shelves, calling them “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic and just plain filthy.” Pico joined with four other students to challenge the school board’s decision. He said it was his patriotic duty.“This is a democracy, and we have majoritarian rights,” Pico said, reflecting on his decision decades ago. “And we've come to a point in our country where people think and feel that they can make decisions for everybody else, like removing a book.”Andrea Fiorillo, co-chair of the Massachusetts Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom Social Responsibility Committee, said most people are against censorship, but they need to make their voices heard as much as those pushing for it.“We are at an inflection point in our democracy where democratic norms and freedoms are being challenged,” said Fiorillo. On June 30, state Sen. Julian Cyr filed an act regarding free expression that bolsters existing state laws. Cyr said the legislation would prevent book removal, media and materials due to personal or political views in both public and school libraries, and protect librarians from retaliation. The Massachusetts House has also advanced a similar bill, An Act Ensuring Freedom to Read in the Commonwealth.""We must continue to champion our values of equity and belonging, that we cannot allow small-minded bans or politically opportunistic censorship to interfere with the right to read,” Cyr said.The ACLU of Massachusetts has also sent a letter to the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents and the Massachusetts Association of School Committees highlighting their legal obligations when it comes to books challenges. Bourquin said she doesn’t believe most schools are caving to book challenges, but instead follow a thoughtful review process that usually results in retaining the materials in question.And on the national level, Pico continues to push for freedom of speech and expression.“It seems like history is repeating itself on steroids,” Pico said. “And that is what's happening. But I'm optimistic, and I'll tell you why: because young people out there are listening now. They're aware that they have rights and there are things that they can do to combat censorship.”",Local,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 05:00:47 EST",2e71beb62514cb30543c244aec559b5e
3711,Community colleges in Massachusetts to drop COVID-19 vaccine mandate after spring semester,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/03/08/community-colleges-in-massachusetts-to-drop-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-after-spring-semester,The decision comes a year and a half after the requirement first went into effect.,"If you attend a community college in Massachusetts this summer or fall, you will no longer be required to have a COVID-19 vaccine — with some exceptions. Since January 2022, the state’s 15 community colleges have mandated students and staffers receive the vaccine if they’re attending classes in person or working on campus. After this spring semester, though, the schools will lift that mandate.“We felt like it had served its purpose. It had kept our communities and our campuses safe,” said David Podell, president of Mass Bay Community College and chair of the state’s Community College Council of Presidents. Podell said the schools are “following the science"" and that it’s probably not necessary to continue to require the vaccine. ""The rates of COVID infection are low in our communities, and we felt it was safe now to drop the mandate,” he said.Many community college students studying health care also work in hospitals and nursing homes. The schools say those students will have to follow requirements of their clinical placements or internships.Among higher education institutions, the pandemic has hit community college enrollment the hardest, with more than 860,000 fewer students nationwide since fall 2019 to fall 2022, according to the National Student Clearinghouse. Massachusetts alone has more than 10,000 fewer community college students.Podell said he doesn’t think lifting the mandate will make a difference on enrollment one way or the other. He points to Mass Bay, where enrollment last fall was even with the previous year — and this spring it went up 6.5%. “That's before the change of the vaccination requirement, so we're seeing a turn,” Podell said. “It will vary from one community college to another, but overall, I think, we're seeing finally the change in people's behavior coming out of the pandemic, independent of the issue of the [vaccine] requirement.”While the vaccine will no longer be required, the community college presidents say they're strongly encouraging all members of their communities to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.",Education,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 14:58:09 EST",5572a44b6d7f9d906f698458ea508096

At the outset, the program will provide $4 million in grants to yet-to-be determined training programs, drawn from the city's Neighborhood Jobs Trust and federal funding already secured through the American Rescue Plan Act. Preference will be given to programs that show they've received internship and hiring commitments from local companies and focus on trainees without four-year degrees, including immigrants, people of color, and women. ""We know that in the years ahead, the regional life sciences industry will need thousands of new workers [as] they continue to grow right here in Boston,"" Wu said during a press conference in the lobby of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. ""And as the world's leading life-sciences hub, Boston must be prepared to meet that demand by drawing on the talent that lives right here in our city today.""The initial round of grants will also be used to create what Wu called an ""intermediary organization"" aimed at providing support to Bostonians from underrepresented backgrounds who pursue careers in biotech, including child care and transportation. Wu unveiled the campaign in a press conference in the front lobby of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, as thousands of attendees streamed in for the BIO International Convention's first day. She was joined by several other stakeholders with an interest in reshaping the contours of the local biotech industry, including Vertex Pharmeceuticals President and CEO Reshma Kewalramani, Massachusetts Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones, and MassBio President and CEO Kendalle Burlin O'Connell, who said Boston's new push reflects principles the industry ought to embrace.""It's about making sure that our workforce represents the patient population that we serve,"" O'Connell said.""We all want to make sure that Massachusetts stays the best place in the world for life sciences,"" she added. ""We want to make sure that the innovation that happens here can positively impact patients, sick people, around the globe. And we want to make sure that every person who wants to work in a career in the life sciences has that opportunity.""While diversity and increased representation have been hallmarks of Wu's vision for Boston, launching this particular campaign in the midst of an international biotech conference was also an artful exercise in city branding, something Wu seemed to acknowledge directly early in her remarks. ""We are so proud to host this global event,"" Wu said. ""It's a powerful statement to kick off this week focusing on our local workforce."" In addition to the grant-funded workforce initiative, Wu also announced the launch of a promotional campaign aimed at increasing awareness of biotech careers in Boston's neighborhoods.After the event, a city spokesperson stressed that the $4 million in grant funds announced by Wu is an initial investment, and said the city plans to provide ""significantly more"" in the future.",Politics,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 16:29:51 EST",028a18621da69668416d9e28251434f1
971,Bed Bath & the great Beyond: How the home-goods giant went bankrupt,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/24/bed-bath-the-great-beyond-how-the-home-goods-giant-went-bankrupt,Once an unstoppable retailer Bed Bath & Beyond has now filed for bankruptcy.,"A total of 10 shoppers meandered the vast and visibly sparse aisles of a Bed Bath & Beyond in Northern Virginia on a recent Sunday.""Is it me or is it particularly cold in here?"" one shopper asked another, pushing an empty cart past a wall of identical comforters. She scanned the bare cul-de-sac of home decor that displayed a few mirrors and a scuffed wall shelf. A fluorescent light buzzed and flickered overhead.Once an unstoppable retailer — deemed a ""category killer"" for its triumph over many rivals — Bed Bath & Beyond has now filed for bankruptcy. It plans to begin closing its 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 120 BuyBuy Baby stores. A vision of this chain's survival is bleak.""I remember thinking it feels like the last days of Sears in here,"" said Daniel Callahan from Louisville, Ky., about a visit to once-beloved Bed Bath & Beyond a few months ago. ""I wound up buying nothing,"" he said. Soon after, that store indeed shuttered.Bed Bath & Beyond enters bankruptcy distraught and turbulent, after several misfired turnarounds, abrupt leadership shakeups, a rise and crash as a meme stock, store closures, job cuts and numerous last-gasp financing deals. For months, the chain has been losing both money and shoppers, struggling to restock shelves as suppliers and banks cut off its tab.Beneath the chaos, the home goods giant has faced a fundamental question: In a world that shops online, swarmed by competitors, where does it fit in?A cultural icon is bornLaunched in 1971 with two towels-and-bedding stores in New Jersey, Bed Bath & Beyond grew even through the Great Recession. It outlived its main rival Linens 'n Things, later buying BuyBuy Baby, the World Market and online retailer One Kings Lane. As recently as 2018, the chain had more than 1,500 stores.Its Big Blue coupon for 20% off, ubiquitous and never expiring, became such a part of the American shopping fabric that even mobster Whitey Bulger had one in his kitchen drawer. TV show Broad City built a whole subplot around it. (Bed Bath & Beyond will stop accepting coupons on April 26.)The chain also had perfected a secret power play: Unlike most retailers, Bed Bath let local managers choose what to sell in their stores, catering to the particular tastes of shoppers in their area.""Floor to ceiling, stack 'em high and watch 'em fly — that was kind of our motto,"" said Beth Grossfeld, who spent 13 years in the marketing division of Bed Bath & Beyond. ""And the customers loved it. It was like a treasure hunt. You got what you wanted and 10 other things.""A halting search for identity beginsBut over time, Bed Bath & Beyond faced a growing crew of rivals: Amazon, Target, Wayfair and West Elm. The company meandered in a search of its niche.""I would go into one meeting and it would be 'we need to be ... the destination for home, more upscale, home decor, more furniture,' "" Amy Laskin, a former Bed Bath & Beyond content marketing executive, told NPR.""The next conversation would be 'we need to be more competitive with Amazon. We need to be the destination with everything,'"" she recalled. ""The next thing you know, we were carrying diamond jewelry like Costco does.""Bed Bath & Beyond seemed equally indecisive about its online presence.One of its founders later acknowledged to The Wall Street Journal that the chain ""missed the boat on the internet."" It whipped up a dizzying website, but as recently as 2019, ran ads promoting ""offline shopping"" as its heart remained in stores, with their stacks of cookware, walls of trash cans and piles of pillows.""We really were going through a kind of an [identity] crisis of trying to compete with our ever-growing competitors,"" said Grossfeld, who left Bed Bath & Beyond in 2019. ""There were a lot of things that we were trying to be that we weren't.""Turnarounds fail to turn things aroundThat year, in 2019, a push by activist investors forced out the longtime chief executive and the company's founders who had remained on the board.The new CEO, Mark Tritton, arrived from Target with a big idea that had worked there: Bed Bath & Beyond would replace big-name brands with its own, more profitable private labels. The chain rushed to ""declutter"" stores and close 200 underperforming ones. Instead of Ralph Lauren towels and Calphalon pans came new store brands like Everhome and Nestwell.The timing proved disastrous, coinciding with the pandemic supply-chain scramble. Just when stuck-at-home shoppers wanted all of what Bed Bath & Beyond normally sells, top items like KitchenAid mixers went missing from its shelves.Soon, Tritton and other leaders were out — but not before Bed Bath & Beyond spent $1 billion to buy back its own stock. The move benefits shareholders, and companies sometimes do it when they believe their shares are undervalued.This conviction was also shared by followers of activist investor Ryan Cohen of Chewy and GameStop fame. Cohen last year bought a stake in the company, advocating the sale of BuyBuy Baby. His fans on Reddit and YouTube pumped up the stock. Then, just as suddenly, Cohen sold his entire stake.A future unravelsFor the quarter ending just after Black Friday 2022, the company's losses widened by 42% and sales dipped by a third. In the following quarter, sales dropped even further. Even Grossfeld, a devoted fan as a former employee, struggled to shop at Bed Bath & Beyond.""[I thought] I know the stores like the back of my hand, and I couldn't find anything that I needed to style one bedroom for a photo shoot,"" she said. ""That was kind of a really sad day.""Bed Bath & Beyond strained to turn around the failed turnaround. Executive Sue Gove took the helm with a ""back-to-basics"" plan to replenish the big-name brands, but the brand suppliers were now anxious about ever getting paid. So were Bed Bath's lenders.In January, the chain defaulted on some of its loans shortly after warning it may go bankrupt. The company announced dozens more store closures and sought breaks on rent. For months, it exhausted numerous financial lifelines from banks and investors. Some landlords were reported to be readying new tenants. Its stock price drifted below $1, then below 50 cents.Bed Bath & Beyond ""is at a point where they can't really invest in anything to turn around their fortunes. But even when the company had funds to invest in turning around their fortunes, they didn't show an ability to do so,"" said David Silverman, who tracks retail at Fitch Ratings.He pondered one big question Bed Bath & Beyond raised in its Sunday filing: Could the company sell itself in bankruptcy? Then, he answered it with another, even bigger one: Given all of its existential relapses, what exactly is this business actually worth?

1058,Why estate planning isn’t only for the wealthy,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/02/why-estate-planning-isnt-only-for-the-wealthy,The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts will take up a case about a pet trust.,"It's often said that the only certainties in life are death and taxes. But for many people, the two converge when it comes to estate planning, the legal process of drafting wills and trust. This week, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts is hearing several interesting oral arguments in cases that relate to estate planning. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed joined GBH’s Morning Edition to discuss. This transcript has been edited lightly.Paris Alston: So first of all, I had no idea that apparently you did a little bit of tax and estate work early in your career. Is that right? Daniel Medwed: That's right. To this day, my wife sometimes introduces me as a recovering tax lawyer. It happened to be my late father's area of practice. It really wasn't my cup of tea, but I really liked the idea of helping families, in particular, navigate the process and try to reduce their wishes to writing as they thought about what would happen after they passed. Alston: I'll tell you a quick little story here. When I was maybe 10 or so, I wrote a will because — oh, I don't know why. I did not think that I was going to no longer exist at that point of my life. But I think I was like, ""I'll give all my journals to my brothers,"" or something like that. Medwed: Sweet. Alston: But, you know, a lot of times people might think that estate planning is for really wealthy people. And that you have to have oodles of money and assets for the estate tax to apply to you. Is that true? Medwed: Not exactly. On the one hand, yes, federal law does exclude a sizable portion of a person's assets from the federal estate tax. It's called the exemption amount. And in 2023, the exemption amount is — get this — $13 million. Basically, $12.92 million is excluded from the federal estate tax. But on the other hand, the size of the federal exemption is currently scheduled to dwindle considerably in the years ahead by about 50% toward the end of 2025. And regardless of your federal estate tax liability, most of us or many of us in Massachusetts will be subject to a very onerous state tax upon our death.In Massachusetts, anyone with an estate in excess of $1,000,000 is subject to a graduated estate tax, ranging from a little less than 1% to 16%. So it can be a pretty big hit. And regardless of one's assets, even if taxation isn't a concern upon your death, I think all of us have an interest in dispersing and allocating our prized possessions in a way that aligns with our values and desires. Our diaries, our journals. Alston: As they have to go to the right person — you can't just give them to anybody. Medwed: They have to be the right person, exactly. And so I think of estate planning as not just the province of the wealthy, but really as something for all of us. And we all should have access to it. Alston: So Daniel, tell us what is happening at the SJC. Medwed: The [case] that caught my eye first is a really interesting case that deals with an issue that crops up a lot in wills and trusts, which is what if the plain language in a will is less than clear? How do you interpret certain terms? So in this case, back in 2013, a 77-year-old woman executed her will and she bequeathed all of her assets to her 15-year-old cocker spaniel, Licorice. Alston Oh, my goodness. Medwed Yes — or to any other pets that she might own at the time of her death. And then upon the death of her last remaining pet — it's called a pet trust. And it's actually not so uncommon. Upon the death of the last surviving pet, the trustees were supposed to allocate the remaining assets to a charity. The problem was that Licorice predeceased the owner. Licorice died in 2017. The owner died in 2019. She died petless, but not penniless. So the issue is what should happen with her assets and there was a little bit of a brouhaha amongst her four heirs, her four nieces and nephews. Basically, one of them thought the money should just go straight to a charity — that best accorded with her aunt's wishes. The other three thought that the money should pass through what are called the laws of intestacy, as if their aunt hadn't had a will. And it's become a big legal drama, essentially, about what should be done with this money. Alston: Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to be flip here either, but I imagine some of them may have been thinking, well, why did you send it to the pet first and not me? I don't know. Not my business. Well, what ended up happening there? Medwed: Well, it's really interesting. So a trial judge looked at this and said, ""Hey, this is true the will didn't contemplate this situation. If in fact the executor, the testator, the person who wrote the will, died without a pet."" However, looking at the will as a whole, the judge thought its true intent here was for the charitable remainder, the remaining assets, to go to charity. Any money that wasn't used for a pet should go to a charity. And the judge cited a doctrine known a long-standing rule of legal construction, known as the acceleration of remainders doctrine, that basically says you can accelerate or advance a remaining interest in a trust in order to realize the ideal of the will. That's a lot of legalese, but basically the idea is let's follow the spirit of this will rather than just its letter. And we're going to see how this plays out in the SJC. Alston: I do want to ask for folks who are wondering about this: Is it best for them to go someone to help them draft their will? Not to write it in their journal, I take it? Medwed: Probably, I wouldn't write in the journal. I think it would make sense to get some legal advice because you want to avoid litigation like this, right? You want to make sure that your intent is crystal clear.",Local,"Tue, 02 May 2023 11:41:32 EST",6f67c7dda573906764cc5133cd17ecb9
4013,Florida lawmakers want to use radioactive material to pave roads,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/09/florida-lawmakers-want-to-use-radioactive-material-to-pave-roads,Roads in Florida could soon include phosphogypsum — a radioactive waste material from the fertilizer industry — under a bill lawmakers have sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis.,"Roads in Florida could soon include phosphogypsum — a radioactive waste material from the fertilizer industry — under a bill lawmakers have sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis.Conservation groups are urging DeSantis to veto the bill, saying phosphogypsum would hurt water quality and put road construction crews at a higher risk of cancer.Here's what to know about the law and about phosphogypsum.What would the law do, specifically?HB 1191 would compel the Florida Transportation Department to study using phosphogypsum in paving projects, calling for ""demonstration projects using phosphogypsum in road construction aggregate material to determine its feasibility as a paving material.""If it's approved, phosphogypsum would join pavement aggregates such as crushed stone, gravel and sand. In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration says, industrial byproducts and reclaimed materials have also been used as aggregates.The bill sets a deadline of April 1, 2024, giving the transportation agency less than a year to complete its work and make a recommendation. The Republican-dominated Florida Legislature approved the measure by a wide margin.What is phosphogypsum and why is there so much of it?In fertilizer, phosphorus is particularly important for plants to have strong roots and for crops to be productive. Florida has been an important source since the 1800s; today, the EPA notes, ""Florida alone accounts for approximately 80 percent of the current capacity, making it the world's largest phosphate producing area.""When phosphate rock is dissolved in sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid for fertilizer and a few other uses, phosphogypsum is what's left over.The commonly used production process, which dates to the 1840s, is not very efficient. For every ton of phosphoric acid produced, more than 5 tons of phosphogypsum waste is generated.Florida's prominent role means the state also has massive waste sites called phosphogypsum stacks, or ""gypstacks."" Such stacks can be very large — spanning up to 800 acres and about 200 feet in height. They've been linked to serious problems over the years, due to sinkholes and other breaches.Is it dangerous?""Phosphogypsum contains appreciable quantities of uranium and its decay products, such as radium-226,"" according to the EPA. And because the fertilizer production process concentrates waste material, ""phosphogypsum is more radioactive than the original phosphate rock,"" the agency notes.""The radium is of particular concern because it decays to form radon, a cancer-causing, radioactive gas,"" the EPA adds.An analysis commissioned by the Fertilizer Institute, a group that represents the fertilizer industry, disagrees, saying that using phosphogypsum in road construction won't produce radioactive doses that are above the EPA's acceptable risks. Such work, it stated, ""can be done safely and results in doses that are a small fraction of those arising from natural background radiation.""Last November, researchers in China who reviewed numerous existing studies on recycling phosphogypsum said they were optimistic about its potential use in road construction materials. But they concluded that more studies are needed, noting that ""few studies have focused on its durability or analyzed its long-term effects on soil and water resources.""Critics of the new legislation are urging DeSantis to use his veto power.""Using radioactive phosphogypsum in roads is not a solution to the fertilizer industry's toxic waste problem,"" the Center for Biological Diversity and more than 30 other groups said in a letter to the governor. ""Florida should not be a test subject in the industry's reckless experiment.""The groups say the fertilizer industry has already shown it can't adequately manage more than 1 billion tons of waste currently stored in Florida.Is Florida's plan legal?The EPA states that ""phosphogypsum remains prohibited from use in road construction,"" as it has been almost continuously for more than 30 years.Under former President Donald Trump, the EPA briefly rescinded that policy starting in October 2020. But it reinstated the rule in June 2021.The Florida legislation doesn't address the federal prohibition outright, saying that phosphogypsum can be used as an aggregate material ""in accordance with the conditions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency approval for the use."" Its supporting documents also note that the EPA allows some uses for research purposes — and it asserts that phosphogypsum is not technically a ""solid waste.""When contacted by NPR to comment on Florida's plan, the EPA did not immediately supply a statement. What's next?DeSantis could sign the phosphogypsum road-test measure into law at any time; it he takes no action, the bill will be enacted automatically.

7610,'Yacht rock is a vibe:' Yacht Rock Revue brings chill tunes to Massachusetts,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/12/yacht-rock-is-a-vibe-yacht-rock-revue-brings-chill-tunes-to-massachusetts,The icons of the nostalgia-heavy soft-rock genre popular in the 1970s and ’80s are in Boston Friday.,"If the words “yacht rock” bring anything to mind, it’s probably the dulcet tones of Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins, or West Coast-centric, boat-owning, soft-rocking, good time tunes. “But more than that, yacht rock is a vibe,” Nicholas Niespodziani, who sings in the band Yacht Rock Revue, told GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel. “You know, you're drinking a piña colada on the beach, chilling out, this is the music to put on.”Yacht Rock Revue, icons of the nostalgia-heavy soft-rock genre popular in the 1970s and ’80s, are in Hyannis Thursday evening and at the Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston Friday. “The exchange of energy between the band and the audience is incredible at our shows, particularly in Boston,” Niespodziani said. “We recorded our first live album in Boston and there's just something about Massachusetts, Smooth-achusetts, if you will, that that really connects.”Niespodziani and Peter Olson, who also sings in the band, met growing up in Indiana. They formed a band called Y-O-U in the ’90s and started playing shows in Atlanta.“We had an indie rock band but never really made it, and we were kind of on the back end of that, in our late 20s trying to figure out what was next,” Olson said. The band did a yacht rock-themed show almost at random, playing a one-off for one-hit wonders of the 1970s, Olson said. “We did one show and it sold out, and then we did another show and it sold out. And then all of a sudden it's becoming more popular and we're quitting our jobs and getting an office and buying a van and becoming a real band,” Olson said. “And it's been a wild journey. We keep wondering, when is it going to fade out? But it's only getting stronger 15 years in.”The band has since grown to 10 members who tour nationwide for much of the year. In Yacht Rock Revue’s early days, audiences seemed to be drawn to the music a bit more ironically, Olson said. He’d see people elbowing one another when Rupert Holmes’ “Escape (The Piña Colada Song)” came on. But yacht rock’s power comes from its ever-presence, Niespodziani said. “These are wonderfully crafted songs, and there's something about them that actually never left,” Niespodziani said. “It's almost like they'd been in the subconscious part of our brains in that they've actually been spinning in like, your grocery store and your dentist's office and at your hardware store. If you pay close attention, once you know what yacht rock is, you'll realize that it's everywhere.”It’s also just fun, Olson said. “You don't have to feel guilty about enjoying the songs,” Olson said. “They're fun to listen to.

A progressive college in Massachusetts offers 'a sanctuary.',https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/03/16/seeking-asylum-from-florida-politics-a-progressive-college-in-massachusetts-offers-a-sanctuary,Hampshire College first to make a play for Florida students,"A progressive college in Western Massachusetts made a pitch to Florida students who are fed up with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' policies: come north.""We can offer you a sanctuary,"" Hampshire College President Ed Wingenbach said.The offer is meant to attract students of New College on the shores of Sarasota Bay. Florida's governor has repeatedly complained about “woke culture” on New College's campus. He replaced six members of the state college's 13 board of trustees with conservatives who said they intended to remake the school in the likeness of Hillsdale College, a Christian college in Michigan with a politically conservative bent. DeSantis has also enacted new state rules that ban instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation and limit what schools can teach about racism. Hampshire College, where students do not receive letter grades and do not announce majors, said it will admit all students ""in good standing"" from New College and match the school's tuition: $6,916 for in-state plus fees, and $29,944 for out-of-state students. New College officials and DeSantis' office did not respond to requests for comment. Like Hampshire College, New College allows students to design their own curriculum. The college said it's committed to free speech, inclusion and social justice, describing itself as “a community of free thinkers.” Hampshire's Wingenbach called it a ""sibling"" school.Wingenbach, a former political science professor, said DeSantis and new board members at the Florida college are now trying to overhaul the curriculum, which spurred him to action.""Those of us who care about the ability of higher education to support democratic citizenship have to start doing something to push back, because this isn't going to stop,"" he said. The move would also help Hampshire, based in Amherst, Massachusetts. It has fewer than 500 students enrolled this semester, and has suffered from the same financial and demographic challenges facing many small private colleges. The college enlisted help from documentary filmmaker and alum Ken Burns to raise money to stay afloat.Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, said Hampshire's offer is the first of its kind. And she added that she hopes other colleges follow its lead.""There's real concern on the part of educators across the country about the very existence of American higher education,” Pasquerella said. ""It's not enough to decry these attacks on academic freedom and shared governance. Leaders at colleges and universities need to act individually and collectively and Hampshire is leading the way and really living their mission.""Hampshire said four New College students have already accepted its admission offer since it was announced on its website last week, and at least 20 others have asked for more information.",Education,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 15:55:17 EST",126bb7c1a7e3ae6bf04a1f18a83ecd70
96,Boston wants to make EVs EZ,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/06/boston-wants-make-evs-ez,Hoping for Black-owned businesses to break into Boston’s decarbonization space.,"This story first ran in GBH News’ politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get our rundown of the Massachusetts’ latest political happenings every Thursday morning straight to your inbox.SeparatorIf you have a bright idea for how to set up and run a bunch of curbside electric vehicle charging stations, the city of Boston wants to hear from you. At the end of June, Boston issued two requests seeking ideas from contractors about how to build a charging network — one for a system that would be owned and operated by the city, the other run by a private company. The city is pretty clear that they don’t know what this would look like. One of the bid documents says Boston’s looking for a partner who “will help discover a model of deploying curbside chargers that can be brought to scale citywide.” The goal is to install a minimum of 60 curbside charging stations. Shonté Davidson is the president of a partnership of minority- and women-owned businesses called the Better Together Brain Trust that is trying to break into the EV installation field. She says Boston’s plug-in ambitions are “a great opportunity” but there are still a bunch of barriers — not the least of which is “the business model isn’t there because there isn’t enough demand” to generate revenue for whoever owns the charging stations. But Boston is also in a hurry: The bids say the city wants the charging stations up and running within six months of signing a contract. Like other governments and agencies across the state of Massachusetts, Boston has not had a strong record of signing contracts with minority-owned businesses. With billions of federal dollars flowing into green infrastructure through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act over the next few years, there has been a push by the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts to expand minority participation — in particular in the EV industry. BECMA chief Nicole Obi said the group is focusing on assembling “pods” of small businesses that can work together to win an EV installation and service contract, since very few individual companies have all the skills and certifications required for the whole project. BECMA has held workshops for about 100 small businesses to get them engaged in the EV marketplace. Boston clearly sees an opportunity to bring in diverse businesses in the green energy economy. Green New Deal Director Oliver Sellers-Garcia told GBH News that while he can’t comment on any specific procurement, “small and minority owned businesses are really a growth sector in the whole business of decarbonization. ... I think there is definitely an opportunity, whether it's this [project] or in the future, for businesses to grow into this space.” Since 2020, the Color of Public Money series from GBH News’ investigative team has documented the failure of Massachusetts government entities to buy goods and services from minority-owned businesses. We proved the value of contracts won by minority businesses had dropped over two decades. Partly in response to our stories, the state has put more focus on diverse spending, and the value of contracts won by minority-owned firms jumped last year. Just last week, the Healey administration set goals for the first time in spending money with LGBTQ-owned and disability-owned businesses. As the state works on spending more with Black and brown businesses, going green may create an opportunity to do better.",Politics,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:30:57 EST",44e4d028bfb74fb32cee64f76edb313a
1946,Police departments across Massachusetts are rolling out body cameras this year,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/13/police-departments-across-massachusetts-are-rolling-out-body-cameras-this-year,Dozens of communities got state grants to implement these systems.,"A number of Massachusetts police departments are equipping officers' uniforms with body cameras for the first time this year, as cities and towns across the commonwealth roll out new programs boosted by millions in state grant money.“We knew it was something we were eventually going to have to do,” Dennis Police Lt. Peter Benson said. “The big thing was really where the funding was going to come from.”Dennis police plan to start using body cameras this May, using a $100,900 grant from the state to implement and support a 40-camera program for three years.The grant is part of $2.5 million in state funding issued in November to help 32 police departments adopt or expand body-worn camera programs.In announcing the first round of these grants in 2021, state officials said only 10% of municipal police departments in the state already had body cameras, but 75% of departments were interested in using the devices. Overall, the state plans to distribute $20 million over five years, which it has said would be enough to buy about 9,000 body-worn cameras and servers for video storage.Discussions about police transparency and accountability have led many departments to consider implementing bodycams. Last summer, a task force created under the state's 2020 police reform law issued specific body camera guidelines for towns and cities. The task force also concluded that financing these programs would be a critical issue for local governments to address.Police departments that have benefited from state funding say the grants can help get them up and running, but some — especially those in smaller towns — are concerned about finding funds to support ongoing costs.Michael White, a professor at Arizona State University and co-author of ""Cops, Cameras, and Crisis: The Potential and the Perils of Police Body-Worn Cameras,"" said cost is one of the main issues departments face when implementing body-worn camera programs.He said that beyond startup funding, it’s important for departments to address long-term financial considerations like maintenance and storage. Police body cameras generate large video files that must be stored for years for investigative purposes.“The ongoing costs are what add up really quickly,” White said.Dalton, a suburb of Pittsfield, received $129,368 from the state's latest round of grants. It used the money to equip 14 police officers with body-worn cameras, launching the program in March.“I’ve always been interested in them,” said Deanna L. Strout, who has been Dalton’s police chief for two years. “When the state’s putting out grant funding for the body cams, I think it’s just a smart move to be proactive and get ahead of it.”Strout said her department's funding should cover the program for five years, but she worries about the long-term cost. She hopes future grant funding will ease some of the community burden.“It’s a mandated situation,” she said. “It’s not fair to the taxpayers of small towns to have to foot such a large bill.”SeparatorGBH News is committed to providing in-depth coverage of police body camera issues, and will be reporting on this subject throughout the year. If you have story ideas or suggestions, contact us at investigations@wgbh.org.SeparatorHanover Police Chief Timothy Kane, whose department received $110,702 to equip 30 officers for their program launching in July, said data storage costs are a pain point for many departments, especially with the grant’s requirement that departments save files on their own servers, rather than in the cloud. Kane said the department worked closely with Hanover’s information technology office to identify the most cost-effective option.“We know many cities/towns face a significant challenge when it comes to funding storage,” Kane said in a statement to GBH News. “We looked at this challenge as one we would overcome so long as we purchased the correct equipment.”Southborough received $78,547 from the state, and deployed 19 cameras in April as part of a trial program to get officers acquainted with equipment and sort out any technical issues. Southborough Police Chief Ryan Newell said that the department planned on full implementation for May 2.Newell said that grant will support the town's body camera program for five years. After that, the costs will be treated like any other police equipment needs and be factored into the town's capital budget — the same approach Benson will apply in Dennis.Worcester, which was part of the first round of state grants, launched its body camera program in February. The city had been studying the issue for more than eight years. Funding was a major factor in the slow rollout. In addition, some police officials expressed concern that body cameras would change officers' behavior, such as not using force even when deemed appropriate, due to potential public criticism.Cambridge faced a different hurdle, with a local ordinance meaning police needed approval from City Council to acquire surveillance technology. After the police killing of Sayed Faisal, which led to greater calls in the community for police transparency, the city announced it would pursue a bodycam program. Officials have not yet provided a timeline or additional details.North Reading Police Chief Michael Murphy, who’s department received a $133,994 grant in the latest distribution, said in a statement to GBH News that he and three lieutenants have agreed to wear body cameras, however the Patrol/Sergeant’s Union has not.“I believe every police officer should be equipped with them,” Murphy said in a statement to GBH News. “Although the camera does not provide a complete view of what an officer sees, they should be utilized despite the shortcomings.”Murphy said so far, the state has released funding for him and the three lieutenants to buy cameras and storage, with the rest of the funding set to be released once an agreement is reached with the Patrol/Sergeant’s Union. North Reading Patrol/Sergeant Union President Tim King declined to comment but said the union anticipates the issue to be a subject of upcoming contract negotiations.Shekia Scott, who founded the Boston Police Camera Action Team in 2014, said over the years she has seen the issue shift from controversial to an expectation for police departments. She said as more departments adopt body-worn cameras, she hopes the programs can be used to examine policing at a deeper level.“Body cameras initially give us more insight into the psychology and sociology of policing,” she said.However, Scott said in adopting new technology, it is important to keep the community at the table for oversight.“We’re funding something where again the police are policing themselves,” she said.White, the Arizona State University professor, said most departments have taken the approach of using body-worn cameras to show they have “nothing to hide.”In the Dennis Police Department, Benson said he had seen officers' attitudes toward body cameras change as they recognized the benefits. He said in the past, many officers looked at body cameras with skepticism, but that has largely evaporated.“A lot of [police] thought ‘They’re just trying to catch us doing things that we shouldn’t be doing’ or looking for a gotcha moment,’” he said. “The attitude [now] is more ‘no, this is a protection for us.’”Strout said she has also seen many officers understand the value footage from body cameras can have for officers.“If there’s a question about what happened it’s there,” Strout said. “It’s not ‘he said versus she said.’ It’s documented evidence.”Southborough Chief Newell agreed.“All you have to do is press play,” he said.",Local,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 05:00:11 EST",5aff5e411cd14c69343da64c883e5be5
6083,A surging river floods Vermont's capital as crews rescue more than 100 people,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/11/a-surging-river-floods-vermonts-capital-as-crews-rescue-more-than-100-people,Massachusetts volunteers headed north to help amid the flooding.,"Updated July 11 at 8:16 p.m.ANDOVER, Vt. (AP) — A storm that dumped up to two months of rain in two days in Vermont and other parts of the Northeast brought more flooding Tuesday to communities marooned by water, including the state capital, where officials kept watch on a dam just upstream.There were signs of hope in some areas with flood waters beginning to recede, and officials began assessing the damage and the scope of the clean-up ahead.The flooding has already caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, officials said, with more to come: If water pours over the dam on the Winooski River that flows through Montpelier, it could surge through downtown blocks where the floods were already waist-high.City officials said Tuesday afternoon, however, they had not seen any significant changes in the water levels at the dam, but would continue to monitor it.“Floodwaters continue to rise in some places, like our capital city, and have surpassed the levels seen during Tropical Storm Irene,” Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said. Irene killed six people in Vermont in August 2011, washing homes off their foundations and damaging or destroying more than 200 bridges and 500 miles (805 kilometers) of highway.The sun was out Tuesday and more sunshine was expected Wednesday. But more rain was forecast Thursday and Friday.“We are not out of the woods,” Scott said. “This is nowhere near over.” He tweeted that the roads around his house were impassable Tuesday morning, so he had to hike through the woods to reach the state’s emergency response center.Emergency responders from Massachusetts went up to help state and local rescue efforts. Kelly Isenor, the communications director at the Red Cross of Massachusetts, says it's likely more Massachusetts volunteers will be called to help. ""The shelter — it's not just a place for sleeping. People can go get a warm meal, they can charge their phones. That's where we do a lot of casework, too,"" she said Tuesday evening. ""People that have lost everything can begin to meet with state agencies. ... We have volunteers who, in their day jobs, are also social workers or in the mental health field professionally that can just sit with a client, talk through and really help the emotional impact of all this."" Shelters were set up at churches, town halls and the Barre Municipal Auditorium, where delivering food to the more than 200 people taking refuge there was a challenge. The Massachusetts chapter sent a small group of specialists to Rutland and Barre. “We’re trying to find paths to get supplies in to them,” said John Montes, American Red Cross of Northern New England regional disaster officer. It's difficult now to get volunteers up to the most deluged areas since many roads are impassable. ""Once things clear up, I think we'll see a lot more Red Crossers from all over New England being called into action as well,"" Isenor said. In the meantime, Isenor asked for people to give blood, saying an estimated 500 units of blood went uncollected in Vermont because donation centers were closed. Montpelier Police said just before noon Tuesday that waters had risen to within a foot of the top of the dam, and that every foot of water that goes over the spillway would double the flow into the city. But city officials later said they hadn't seen any significant changes in the water levels since then. They said they would continue to monitor it through the night.One woman was swept away in New York. There have been no reports of injuries or deaths related to the flooding in Vermont, where swift-water rescue teams aided by National Guard helicopter crews have done more than 100 rescues, Vermont Emergency Management said Tuesday.That included an “extremely high-risk rescue” by a visiting New Hampshire team, of a person who decided to drive around a barricaded road, said Mike Cannon of Vermont Urban Search and Rescue. “The car was washed off the roadway almost into the river,” he said, urging drivers to pay attention to road closures.Dozens of roads and highways were closed, including many along the spine of the Green Mountains, and flash flood warnings and advisories were in effect for much of the state, from the Massachusetts line to Canada.Downtown Montpelier, a city of 8,000, was swamped between the capitol building and the Winooski River. Montpelier Town Manager Bill Fraser warned that the Wrightsville Dam several miles to the north could exceed capacity for the first time.“There would be a large amount of water coming into Montpelier which would drastically add to the existing flood damage,” he said, adding that there are very few evacuation options remaining. “People in at risk areas may wish to go to upper floors in their houses.”Multiple rescue crews were positioned in Montpelier, where dispatch, police and fire operations were relocated to a water treatment plant after heavy flooding at City Hall and the police and fire departments. Also, the radio towers they use for emergency calls are not functional, Police Chief Eric Nordenson said.Bryan Pfeiffer, a biologist who has lived in the Montpelier area for four decades, canoed around the downtown area on Tuesday to check out the damage and was appalled by what he saw.“It’s heartbreaking to see my city flooded like this,” said Pfeiffer, whose home is on higher ground. The basement of every building — including the one where he works — and the lower levels of most were inundated by water that reached near the tops of the parking meters.The slow-moving storm reached New England after hitting parts of New York and Connecticut on Sunday. Some communities received between 7 and 9 inches (18 centimeters and 23 centimeters) of rain by Monday night. Towns in southwest New Hampshire had heavy flooding and road washouts, and the Connecticut River was was expected to crest above flood stage Wednesday in Hartford and towns to the south.President Joe Biden, attending the annual NATO summit in Lithuania, declared an emergency for Vermont and authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance. He also spoke with the governor and Sen. Bernie Sanders.FEMA sent a team to Vermont, along with emergency communications equipment, and is prepared to keep shelters supplied if the state requests it. The agency also is monitoring flooding in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire, regional spokesperson Dennis Pinkham said Tuesday.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged people on Tuesday “to please, please be safe, and follow safety protocols.”Road crews cleared debris Tuesday, reopening Interstate 89 as it follows the river between Montpelier and Middlesex. Rescuers from North Carolina, Michigan and Connecticut joined Vermonters in among those reaching towns that had been isolated since torrents of rain began belting the state.One of the worst-hit places was New York’s Hudson Valley, where a woman identified by police as Pamela Nugent, 43, died as she tried to escape her flooded home with her dog in the hamlet of Fort Montgomery.The U.S. Military Academy at West Point was pounded with more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain that sent debris sliding onto some roads and washed others out.“They’re calling this a ‘1,000 year event,’” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a briefing on a muddy street in Highland Falls, just south of the academy on the west bank of the Hudson River.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrator Richard Spinrad said Tuesday that 13.7 million people were under inland flooding alerts on Tuesday. Atmospheric scientists say destructive flooding events happen more frequently as storms form in a warmer atmosphere, and the planet’s rising temperatures will only make it worse.___Minchillo reported from Highland Falls, New York.

1536,5 things to know about acting Massachusetts US Attorney Joshua Levy,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/22/5-things-to-know-about-acting-massachusetts-us-attorney-joshua-levy,"With 25 years of experience and a prior stint at the office, Levy is described as a man of ""great character.""","Joshua S. Levy is the acting United States attorney for the district of Massachusetts, assuming the role on Friday, May 19 when former U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins resigned in the wake of federal ethics probes. Here are five things to know about Joshua Levy.Levy served as first assistant to Rollins since January 2022, supervising about 125 federal prosecutors in the office’s criminal and civil divisions.Before that, he was a partner at Ropes & Gray from 2004 to August 2021. Levy also has familiarity with the U.S. attorney’s office from a past post — he was an assistant U.S. attorney for Massachusetts from 1997 to 2004, serving in the criminal division’s economic crimes unit. Levy is a graduate of Georgetown University Law Center and Brown University.Attorney Christopher Constantine Alberto, who has his own practice, worked with Levy while he was at the U.S. attorney’s office the first time around. “During those six years, I witnessed firsthand his exceptional skills as a prosecutor specializing in white-collar crime and political corruption cases. His dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to upholding justice have always been evident in his work,” said Alberto in an emailed message. “Throughout our time together, I consistently observed his ability to navigate intricate cases with professionalism, thoroughness, and an unwavering pursuit of justice.” Alberto believes Levy should be at the forefront of candidates qualified to serve as the U.S. attorney as that process rolls out. At Ropes & Gray, Levy was the co-chair of the firm’s 325-lawyer litigation and enforcement practice group, and then served as the co-managing partner of their Boston office. His cases involved white-collar criminal matters and complex civil litigation.In 2017, while at Ropes & Gray, Levy was named a ""Lawyer of the Year"" by Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. He said in an interview with the publication that he found it ""equally rewarding"" to be a defense lawyer as it was to work in the U.S. attorney's office.During the beginning of the pandemic, Levy was involved in a group put together by the Supreme Judicial Court to preserve the rights of incarcerated people concerned about getting COVID-19 in prison. That case was brought by the Committee for Public Counsel Services. “He was responsive, open-minded, and respectful regarding the issues we raised. As he steps into this new role with the Department of Justice, we hope he continues the investigations into police misconduct that were initiated by Attorney Rollins and holds accountable any state actors who engage in misconduct against our clients,” said Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel of the Committee for Public Counsel Services. Brien O’Connor, a partner at Ropes & Gray, worked with Levy extensively over the years, first at the U.S. attorney’s office where they met, and then at the firm. He spoke to Levy’s character in an interview. “I think also critically here, given where we are, Josh has the trust and confidence of all of the prosecutors in that office. They know him well. He'd been there as a line prosecutor, and he's been there now as first assistant for some time,” said O’Connor. He called Levy a person “of great character, and is not someone who’s looking to do harm in any unnecessary way to another person.”Levy is listed on press releases for a variety of high-level cases, including the superseding indictment of nonprofit Violence in Boston founder and chief executive Monica Cannon-Grant and Clark Grant, on additional allegations of misusing COVID-19 relief funds and defrauding the city of Boston out of rental assistance money. The couple was previously indicted for the misuse of donations from the nonprofit for personal use. Levy is mentioned in numerous press releases related to racketeering and fentanyl trafficking busts. He’s referenced in a press release about the sentencing of Louis Coleman III for the death of 22-year-old mother Jassy Correia, who was out for her birthday the night Coleman kidnapped, assaulted and killed her. “Jassy Correia was a vibrant and beautiful 22-year-old woman and mother of a toddler daughter,” wrote Levy after Coleman’s sentencing. “By his depravity and his horrific disregard for Ms. Correia’s life, Louis Coleman forfeited his right to live free in society.”He was actively involved in prosecuting cases during his 1997-2004 tenure, including that of Gino Deluca, a former executive for The Gillette Company, for accepting kickbacks from suppliers, mail fraud, wire fraud and false tax returns. Levy’s rise to power came after two separate ethics reports were published by the Justice Department inspector general and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. Those reports detailed Rollins’ alleged abuses of power, including a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty. The Office of the Inspector General found Rollins tried to influence the Suffolk County district attorney election last year, leaking nonpublic information to a journalist. She tried to share potentially damaging information about then interim-District Attorney Kevin Hayden to cast his political rival in a more positive light.On page ten, it’s noted that Rollins unsuccessfully tried to convince Levy to issue a letter that would have created the impression that the Department of Justice was investigating Hayden. The report said that Levy also stated to Rollins that he didn’t think she could be involved in a potential investigation into transit officers’ alleged misconduct and a separate public corruption investigation into Hayden. He then limited his communications with Rollins on the matters because he thought she would be recused from any investigations. Levy was one of the finalists being considered by President Joe Biden's administration in 2021, along with Rollins. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on whether he will be appointed to fill the role permanently this time around. Levy can remain the designated acting U.S. attorney for Massachusetts for many months under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which establishes rules for filling temporarily vacant positions in executive branch agencies that require a presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. If Biden doesn’t nominate anyone for the position, Levy can remain in the acting role for no longer than 210 days. If someone else in nominated in that time period, Levy can serve while that person’s nomination is pending in the Senate. If a future nominee has their nomination rejected by the Senate or withdrawn by Biden, Levy can serve an additional 210 days after the date of that rejection.",Local,"Mon, 22 May 2023 15:29:32 EST",b976db23a5f2b1266483f46ae90af4a5
3465,Ask Dave Epstein: How to stop killing your indoor plants,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/20/ask-dave-epstein-how-to-stop-killing-your-indoor-plants,"Make it a habit, but don't overwater.","Meteorologist Dave Epstein is our go-to person for pressing weather questions on everything from winter blizzards to summer droughts. He’s also a horticulturist, meaning he’s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Epstein graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.I want to get into keeping houseplants, but I always end up killing them. How do I get into the green thumb mindset? “It's got to become kind of a habit,” Epstein said. “If you've never done much gardening or your limited gardening, then it's just going to be one of those things that your life gets too busy and then you don't have time to do it.”Instead, Epstein said, try habit-stacking: Add checking on your plants to something you already do every day. “Every day I know I brush my teeth, so right after I brush my teeth, I check the plant,” he said. Checking on the plant every day, however, absolutely does not mean watering it every day. Many plants don’t need more water until the top inch or two of soil are dry. Over-watering can cause root rot and make plants susceptible to diseases and fungal infections. The ideal watering frequency depends on the plant, Epstein said, but it may be better to err on the side of underwatering when in doubt. “Don't kill it with kindness,” he said. “Plants actually can recover much better from being dried out than they can from being overly wet.”Some beginner-friendly plants Epstein recommended: A cactus, which can sit in a sunny window and get watered on the first day of every month. “You can put in your Google calendar,” Epstein said. Philodendrons are green, leafy, and tend to grow quickly, and spider plants thrive in many conditions. It’s also important to know what not to pick up at the local nursery or garden center.“You get into some of the other plants which can be more difficult, like a polka dot plant. I even can't seem to grow those very well,” Epstein said. “Some ferns are kind of hard because some need a lot of moisture, some need a little bit less moisture.” What should I be doing in my outdoor garden this week? There’s humidity in the forecast, Epstein said. That means it’s time for some disease control in the garden. “The weather looks nice in the next few days, but as we head to the weekend, humidity is going to increase,” Epstein said. Some frequent showers will come this weekend and last into next week, he said. “I am preparing my tomatoes and some of my other plants by pre-inoculating things with disease spray, spraying plants over the next couple of days to prevent funguses and things like that,” he said. “Look for something organic that you can spray your tomatoes especially. They're very susceptible to disease in the upcoming weather.”",Local,"Tue, 20 Jun 2023 10:19:18 EST",091a9a7142ae42dabcee018dd8d943d4

He’s also a horticulturist, meaning he’s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Epstein graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.Warm weather is usually a good thing this time of year, but are we still a little too hot for where we should be? Yesterday we had a high of 74 and a low of 52, five degrees above average. In fact, the temperature has been above average most of the month so far. But, Epstein said, May was quite cool at the beginning, when it was in the 50s. “So the first five or six days of the month, we were running below average — add that in with what's happened since, we're now running four degrees for the month above average. And to run a month four degrees above average is a lot,” he said.Epstein said we usually see four 80-degree days during the entire month of May, and we have already had three, plus today. He said we will continue to see the warmer trend.“Like most of our months now, they just end up being above average by some amount,” he said. “We just don't get many below averages each month.” How is the warm, dry weather affecting fire conditions and my yard? Epstein noted that Logan Airport has seen .28 inches of rainfall this month, while normally it would see 1.53 inches.“That's a huge deficit in rainfall this month. We're behind by an inch and a quarter,” he said. “And I really don't see much chance of any rain until sometime maybe Sunday.” Starting this afternoon, we could start to see the impacts of that dryness. “Lawns are going to start burning out, and plants — it's going to dry things out really quite a bit this afternoon and tomorrow,” he said. “Dew points and temperature are going to be so far apart that our relative humidity — the gap between the two — will be similar to what you'd find in the desert.”What impact does the weather have on allergies right now? Why does it seem worse at night?Epstein said that trees and grasses do release more pollen overnight. “So if your windows are open at night, it actually goes up at night,” he said.Dryness also comes into play to make allergies worse. “We haven't had any rain to cleanse the air,” he said.",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 11:59:48 EST",6c14bec80eaeec394d46471b3326c5ff
1321,Bill would make kids without legal immigration status eligible for MassHealth,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/25/bill-would-make-kids-without-legal-immigration-status-eligible-for-masshealth,"Supporters say more than 30,000 children and young adults are ineligible for full MassHealth coverage because of their immigration status.","Tens of thousands of children and young adults in Massachusetts are unable to access the health care they need because their immigration status poses a barrier, advocates told state legislators Tuesday.Lawmakers on the Health Care Financing Committee heard testimony on bills that would extend comprehensive MassHealth coverage to Massachusetts residents under age 21 who are currently ineligible only because of their immigration status.Children without legal immigration status are not eligible for full MassHealth coverage. Bill supporters said that leaves families to navigate a complicated patchwork of safety net programs that have limits on coverage for some services like mental health, dental care or prescription drugs, and do not cover others, like eyeglasses or home health care.Chelsea resident Ruth Gomez told the committee that she and her family came here from Honduras to seek a better life for her son Dylan, who was born without eyes, is mostly deaf, and has severe developmental disabilities and limited mobility. Speaking in Spanish with an interpreter, Gomez said the limited insurance Dylan initially had didn’t cover much of what he needed, including walking aids, hearing aids, behavioral therapies and tests recommended by doctors. When the family received a new immigration status this year and Dylan could get standard MassHealth, it “made a world of difference,” she said.“Before, feeding him used to be very stressful for me because I was was so fearful he would choke every time,” Gomez said, “Now, with the new health coverage, we have access to a treatment which helps him swallow with more ease, allowing Dylan to eat solid foods and have better nutrition.”Covering more than 2 million people, the state Medicaid program MassHealth is the single largest piece of the state budget.In this year's roughly $56 billion budget, still under negotiation between the House and Senate, lawmakers are eyeing a funding level somewhere around $20 billion, much of which would be reimbursed by the federal government.The bill pending before the committee would direct state health officials to ""maximize federal financial participation for the benefits"" that would be extended to previously ineligible children, but says that the benefits shouldn't be conditioned on whether federal money is available. Similar bills have been filed on Beacon Hill multiple times over the years, but legislative leaders have never brought them to a floor for a vote. This year’s push comes as the state Senate is also seeking a law change that would let Massachusetts high school graduates without legal immigration status pay the lower, in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities, and as the state’s shelter system struggled to meet demand amid an influx of migrants. Amy Grunder of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition said many of the new arrivals are families with young children. She said some newly arriving immigrant children, such as Haitians and Venezuelans participating in an immigration parole process, are able to access comprehensive medical coverage, while others, including asylum seekers, cannot. An asylum claim can take months, assuming a pro bono lawyer is even available, Grunder said.“These children often need access to mental health services as well after undergoing the trauma of a harrowing journey of months or in some cases years to get here,” she said.Twelve other states already have similar laws on their books, according to Health Care for All, including Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island and Maine. Casey Thompson, an assistant attorney general in AG Andrea Campbell’s children’s justice unit, said there are between 30,000 and 48,000 children and young adults in Massachusetts whose only barrier for insurance eligibility is their immigration status. Thompson said her office hasn’t done a formal cost-benefit analysis putting a price tag on the proposed change.“We believe that there is a cost here to doing nothing – in the form of financial [costs], with regard to having kids be forced into having more inpatient stays, more hospitalization visits, and chronic conditions in the long-term,” she said. “But we also believe there’s a non-financial cost here, when you look at the parents, the families of these children and young adults as well as the children and young adults themselves, in terms of their life and well-being, and we believe that deserves due consideration in a cost-benefit analysis as well.”",Politics,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 15:38:04 EST",410c5348476adb319db946601e6d16a7

They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center — and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose: As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff. While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university. In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022. Rath: In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose: We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction — or lack thereof — with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus. We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role — whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development — just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions. Rath: Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose: Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them. Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind. Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers. We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students. Rath: Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose: In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, ""OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?"" Rath: What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty? Rose: In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those. So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, ""OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?""There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great.",Education,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 17:37:21 EST",26a319d1db667ea77f3953fb56f10fca

Executive Director Tom Scott, said she'd brought needed stability to the school district after the previous superintendent was convicted of indecent assault of a school employee. Tahiliani had also received broadly positive feedback in school committee appraisals for the past two years. Mayor Carlo DeMaria was among those supporters in 2021 — but last year he was the lone committee member not to submit any appraisal. In January 2022, Tahiliani filed a discrimination complaint against DeMaria, accusing him and others on the school committee of racism, sexism and interference with her work. And she alleged he was trying to “oust” her.The disconnect between the superintendent's positive feedback and committee members' critical views angered some members of the public at Monday's meeting, who blamed “old school politics” and racism for the decision. “Basically, as I see it, you have two choices. You have racism or anti-racism. Go back to the past or embrace the present and the future. You can use students, families and educators as pawns in your own internal squabbles. Or you can empower them,“ said teacher Shane McNally, addressing the committee before the vote. Several residents at the public microphone pointed to the influence of the mayor, now serving his sixth term in Everett. Resident Janice Lark called it ""a no brainer"" to renew Tahiliani and called for her opponents on the council to explain their positions. “The guy in the corner office does not want her here. We all know that,” Lark said. “Is it because her skin is brown? Is it because she's female? Is it because she's smart? What is it?” DeMaria did not explain his vote, but had made public his opposition to the superintendent in previous meetings. Others who voted no, like committee member Cynthia Sarnie, spoke of being harassed by members of the public and denied rumors that their votes had been bought. She also offered some specifics. “My vote would be based on the safety of the school and the cleaning and cleanliness of the schools,” said Sarnie. Marconi Almeida Barros, the lone member of color on the school committee, said Tahiliani had earned the committee’s support and reminded his colleagues they were the “voice” for students and families. “I don’t know how after listening to all of this, especially from students and parents, we would say no to the superintendent,” Almeida Barros said.Several students of color, like Everett high school junior Tiana Allen, came to the public microphone to explain why having Tahiliani in the role mattered. “When students see someone that looks exactly like them, holding amazing leadership skills and positions, it drives the students to do more,” said Allen, ”to reach for positions that felt so unbelievably out of reach... It means to drive Everett do more.” Tahiliani's current contract runs to March 2024.Qualified superintendents are in short supply nationally. According to M.A.S.S., the state currently needs to fill 45 of the 275 superintendent positions.Speaking to the school committee, Benjamin Murray, a teacher and member of his union’s negotiating committee made a dire prediction. ""On the line is the future of the city, that is what’s on the line,” said Murray. “If you let her go tonight, you will not see another qualified candidate come across your table again.""SeparatorThis story was updated to include comment from Tahiliani.",Local,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 13:45:13 EST",da25d995bdc4a59420722e68849dd549

642,"Erdoğan had 'tremendous' advantages in Turkey's election, Boston lecturer says",https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2023/05/31/erdogan-had-tremendous-advantages-in-turkeys-election-boston-lecturer-says,President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has ruled Turkey for 20 years and has secured another five years as the country's leader.,"The eyes of the world were on Turkey this past weekend as the country headed to the polls for a rare runoff election. The two presidential candidates campaigned on dramatically different visions of the country. The candidate who emerged victorious was Turkey’s leader for the last 20 years: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, known for his extensive presidential power and his Islamist-rooted party positions. His opponent, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, had promised big changes, like restoring Turkey’s democracy and improving human rights. Despite allegations of corruption and a botched response to the devastating earthquakes a few months ago, voters decided President Erdoğan will rule the country for another five years.Metehan Tekinirk, a lecturer at Boston University and Turkish politics expert, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to recap the election and explain what it means on a global scale. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: I think a lot of people were expecting that the widely criticized response to the earthquakes could cost the election for Erdoğan, but it didn’t. Why is that?Metehan Tekinirk: Indeed, there was a lot of hope on the part of the opposition going into the electoral cycle. We could name a number of factors that don’t necessarily have to do anything with opposition and some factors that have to do with the agency, strategies and organizational aspects of the opposition.First of all, the most obvious and important factor that can help us explain Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s victory at the polls is that the electoral scene in Turkey has been tilted towards the incumbent and, of course, against the opposition. This is something that is pretty common to what political scientists call “competitive authoritarianism,” that is, hybrid regimes where the incumbents have built-in advantages.To exemplify, we could talk about President Erdoğan having unrestricted access to state resources and state-regulated channels of communication. On the other side, on the part of the opposition, of course, that was not the case. For example, the telecommunications agency in Turkey restricted the opposition candidate from even sending text messages to citizens. The biggest factor — the elephant in the room — is that the incumbent party, having been in power for 20 years, has enjoyed tremendous built-in advantages with all sorts of state-regulated instruments and public funds available to finance Erdoğan’s campaign, so that’s the most obvious and biggest factor. Rath: Given all the advantages that have controlled the levels of power and basically control the media, is it noteworthy that the opposition did as well as it did and that the election was in any way close?Tekinirk: Yes, that’s a good question. It is certainly noteworthy. We should not downplay the attainments of the opposition. Of course, because of the economic despair in Turkey right now, the botched response to the earthquake and the migration crisis, there were greater expectations for the opposition to perform better. But again, in terms of putting up a good fight, they certainly were able to do so.Rath: Do we have a sense of what Erdoğan’s victory will mean for relations with the West? There have been some tensions with the U.S. and Turkey’s role in NATO, especially with the war in Ukraine, is particularly important right now. Tekinirk: Right. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is a very pragmatic leader who has embraced a more transactional style in foreign politics in the past decade ago, so it would be foolish to assume that simply because his party won again, Turkey would sever its relations with the West completely. But a number of facts remain.For example, we do know that the Russian state and Vladimir Putin invested very heavily in a potential Erdogan victory; they explicitly came out in support of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The same thing could be said about a number of other countries, such as Azerbaijan. Of course, we do know that the Erdoğan administration has fostered growing ties with the state of Qatar. Certain deals, especially financial deals, were made with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. So Turkey is certainly more open to cooperation with those states. But we would be foolish to expect a complete anti-Western, anti-NATO or anti-American stance. Turkey will most likely keep playing the role of a somewhat balanced relationship between the West and other countries. One thing is clear: We do know that the regime in Russia is perfectly content with the electoral outcome, so that’s going to be a hot issue, especially as far as NATO membership for Sweden is concerned. Rath: We have a large Turkish American community in the greater Boston area. Do you have a sense of how much the political divisions in Turkey are at play in the ex-pat community here? How do people tend to fall in terms of their politics about their home country?Tekinirk: The foreign vote was certainly interesting to observe. The vote in European countries and cities was heavily in favor of Mr. Erdoğan, and that’s been a longstanding trend. Looking at the United States in comparison, we saw that Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu actually dominated almost all of the polling stations in the United States. For example, if I’m not mistaken, the tally from the Boston consulate was something like 83%, so a very clear dominating lead for Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. Part of that could be explained by the immigration patterns out of Turkey and into Europe versus out of Turkey and into the United States or, say, the U.K., Canada or Australia. That is not necessarily surprising; those who know Turkish politics and those immigration trends certainly expected the outcome to look exactly like this. That is, a very dominant position for Mr. Erdoğan in Europe and a very dominant performance for the opposition in the United States.Ex-pats living in the United States are very much invested and emotionally invested in what happens in their home country, of course, so I do not expect their attention to be any less, given the result of the election.",International News,"Wed, 31 May 2023 17:53:07 EST",7704b8baa18fb4e4716757b06a879715
6829,An old drug offers a new way to stop STIs,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/11/an-old-drug-offers-a-new-way-to-stop-stis,A promising line of attack against sexually transmitted infections puts a cheap and widely available medication to a new use.,"A promising line of attack against sexually transmitted infections puts a cheap and widely available medication to a new use.The treatment – a form of post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP – is a dose of the antibiotic doxycycline taken in the hours immediately after sex which works to extinguish an STI before it leads to symptoms or spreads to others.A growing body of research shows using doxycycline in this way can substantially lower the risk of contracting three of the most common bacterial STIs — chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.Called doxy-PEP, the preventative treatment has instilled enough confidence that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to roll out guidance later this summer to give doctors and public health departments a roadmap for how to offer it.While doxy-PEP will not be recommended for everyone, including most women, and the implications for antibiotic resistance need to be closely monitored, experts say its potential to curb the rising rates of STIs cannot be ignored.""Our efforts to control STIs for the last 50 years have not succeeded,"" says Dr. Edward Hook, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University Alabama, Birmingham. ""It's time to do something different.""Early results show promiseAt this point, most of the research has focused on how well doxy-PEP works when offered to gay and bisexual men, and transgender women — groups that have disproportionately high rates of STIs.""You really see a signal that there are consistent reductions across the board,"" says Dr. Annie Luetkemeyer, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco who led a recent clinical trial on doxy-PEP, based in Seattle and San Francisco. ""We saw that this was safe. We saw that it was well tolerated. We saw that it reduced sexually transmitted infections,"" she says.Luetkemeyer's study, published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine, found a 65% overall reduction in new STIs among those who took doxycycline within 24 to 72 hours after condomless sex.Specifically, doxy-PEP cut new cases of chlamydia by about 80% and gonorrhea by more than 50%. It also reduced cases of syphilis, but there were fewer cases to report in their trial, she says. It proved so effective that the trial was stopped early so the control group, which wasn't using the antibiotic, could also start receiving it.""Our study does not inform everybody,"" says Luetkemeyer, noting that participants either had an HIV diagnosis or were taking the HIV prevention drug, PrEP, and had at least one STI in the past year. ""It informs a group of people who already had an elevated risk of sexually transmitted infections.""The research builds on promising results from Europe.For example, researchers in France previously found doxy-PEP led to about a 70% reduction in the incidence of chlamydia and syphilis among men who have sex with men, compared to those who didn't receive the medication. And data presented earlier this year from another trial in France showed a 65% overall drop in new infections, including gonorrhea.""The evidence is very strong,"" says Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention. ""More tools are needed in the nation's fight against bacterial STIs,"" which is why CDC is moving quickly on doxy-PEP, he says.In fact, other recent research finds that if doxycycline is prescribed for 12 months at a time to patients with a STI diagnosis, that could reduce future infections by more than 40%.""That's quite a big reduction,"" says Michael Traeger, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School who conducted the analysis.While the federal guidelines are expected to focus on offering doxy-PEP to men who have sex with men and transgender women — the groups who were included in the U.S. and European clinical trials — Luetkemeyer says it's possible that could change in time: ""There is a very reasonable argument that you could offer this to men who're at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections, regardless of their sexual orientation.""But the evidence diverges when it comes to doxy-PEP's effectiveness for most women.A recent trial that included more than 400 Kenyan women, who were at high risk of STIs, concluded that doxy-PEP led to no reductions in STIs.""It's a huge disappointment,"" says Dr. Jenell Stewart, an infectious disease physician at Hennepin Healthcare who led the trial. ""It's incredibly disappointing that we don't have a solution to offer them right now.""The findings are likely due to some combination of ""differences in anatomy, differences in antimicrobial resistant strains in different parts of the world, and adherence"" to the medication, says Stewart, who emphasizes that there need to be more studies before drawing any firm conclusions that doxy-PEP doesn't work in most women.Antibiotic resistance a concern — but early signs are reassuringBroadening access to doxy-PEP would raise concerns about its potential contribution to antibiotic resistance, a global crisis that threatens to undermine some of our only treatments for certain bacterial and fungal infections.""This is a really important novel biomedical intervention,"" says Dr. Manik Kohli, an academic clinical fellow at University College London. ""For an effective rollout, there needs to be clear data and a clear plan in place for how you monitor for new antibiotic resistance.""While there are still questions about what could happen if doxy-PEP gains popularity, researchers have tried to look for signs of increased antimicrobial resistance among those taking the treatment.For example, Staphylococcus aureus — a bacteria that's usually found on the nose and skin — can harbor resistance to doxycycline, and the U.S. trial found an 8% increase in resistance levels among those who took doxy-PEP.""What that trajectory would look like over time is hard to know, but it's going to be really important to understand that,"" says Luetkemeyer.She points out doxycycline isn't actually used to treat most staph infections, although one exception is MRSA, a nasty type of staph that can lead to lethal infections. MRSA can also hang out in people's noses without causing serious infections in most cases. Luetkemeyer says not many people had doxycycline-resistant MRSA in their nose at the beginning of her study, and there didn't appear to be an increase in resistance among those who took the medication.Gonorrhea is another area of concern because of its propensity to develop resistance. About a quarter of gonorrhea cases in the U.S. are already resistant to the class of antibiotics that doxycycline is a part of, and, in some parts of the world, it's much higher.This well-documented resistance is why doxycycline isn't recommended for treating gonorrhea and other antibiotics are used instead, says Hook at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Doxy-PEP trials do show it's less effective at preventing gonorrhea compared to chlamydia, but the fact that it made a meaningful dent in gonorrhea at all should be seen as a ""bonus,"" rather than cause for concern, he says.""It's reasonable to assume that resistance rates for gonorrhea in particular will increase [with wider adoption of doxy-PEP],"" Hook says. ""I don't think it should stand in the way of people seriously considering using this as a public health intervention.""Even if widespread use of doxy-PEP runs the risk of increasing antibiotic resistance, Luetkemeyer stresses that using doxy-PEP isn't ultimately ""a choice between antibiotics and no antibiotics."" That's because many of those who didn't receive doxycycline in her study ended up contracting STIs and needing antibiotics eventually for treatment.Coming soon to a doctor near you?The growing evidence and the anticipated federal recommendations are expected to help move doxy-PEP more into the mainstream of STI prevention and LGBTQ+ health care.But it won't necessarily be new to everyone.Already, some have adopted doxy-PEP to ward off bacterial STIs.""It's been working,"" says Keith Byrd, a gay man who lives in Fort Lauderdale and was prescribed doxycycline by his primary care doctor.Byrd first heard about the idea of doxy-PEP from a friend who's in public health and decided to give it a try after reading more about the research. It's not something he does regularly, but he has taken doxycycline a number of times in the past year after having new sexual partners.""I have certainly talked with a lot of my friends about it, but I don't think it's very mainstream in the gay community at this point,"" he says.Encouraged by the evidence, San Francisco's health department released its own recommendations on doxy-PEP and began offering it to patients at its STI clinic in the fall.""Interest has been very high,"" says Dr. Oliver Bacon, who's a senior supervising physician at San Francisco City Clinic, which is run by the local health department.Bacon says the motivation to move quickly on doxy-PEP — faster than even the CDC — was, in part, because some patients were already ""unofficially"" using antibiotics in one way or another to prevent STIs""They were taking doxy randomly. It was sort of like 'doxy anarchy' out there,"" says Bacon. ""We don't want that to happen. That's not good for anybody. It doesn't treat the problem and it certainly doesn't help issues of antibiotic resistance.""In the U.K., Dr. Kohli says he's also found some patients have resorted to using an ""assortment of antibiotics,"" depending on what they have lying around at home.""""They're not always using doxycycline and that's obviously important to address because actually there's no data around using different antibiotics,"" he says. ""We have no idea if they would work.""The CDC's Mena says the agency recognizes that many health departments and clinicians are waiting for their guidance — what will help ""establish standards of care"" — before moving forward.At the San Francisco clinic, Dr. Bacon says they try to have honest conversations with patients about what's known and isn't known about doxy-PEP, but generally the people who would benefit seem eager to protect themselves and their partners.""Sometimes people think, 'oh, STDs, what's the big deal? It's not HIV. Who cares?'"" says Bacon. ""People do care. They don't want to get gonorrhea, chlamydia or syphilis. They don't want the symptoms themselves. They don't want to infect their sexual partners. There can be quite a lot of stigma associated with having an infection.""

(AP) — A winter storm dumped heavy, wet snow in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday, causing tens of thousands of power outages, widespread school closings, dangerous driving conditions and a plane to slide off a taxiway.The storm's path included parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Snow totals by the time it winds up Wednesday were expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.About two feet of snow fell in parts of northern New York and the Catskill Mountains, and Gov. Kathy Hochul said some areas could get an additional foot of snow by Wednesday morning. In New Hampshire, state police asked drivers to stay off the roads Tuesday afternoon due to whiteout conditions. State Police said they had dealt with more than 120 crashes.In Derry, New Hampshire, firefighters and police officers used chain saws, shovels and their bare hands to rescue a girl who was trapped under a fallen tree. Authorities said the girl had been playing outside near a parent who was clearing snow when the tree fell on her. The girl was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.All northbound lanes of Interstate 95 on the Piscataqua River Bridge between Maine and New Hampshire were shut down after two tractor trailer trucks became stuck on the bridge due to icy conditions.In the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, heavy, wet snow made driving treacherous, weighing down tree limbs and causing several spinouts. The storm dumped at least a foot of wintry mix in some areas.Further east in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where as much as 18 inches of snow was reported to have fallen, Jean Guerrer said the conditions were too dangerous for him to drive to work as a Boston-based taxi driver.Peter Davis, a semiretired commercial roofer, relished in the snowstorm, breaking out his new snow blower. But an hour into the snow removal, a piece of asphalt thrown onto the sidewalk by a snow plow got stuck in his new snow blower and broke a shear pin, forcing him to go repair the equipment.A Delta Air Lines plane veered off a paved surface as it taxied for takeoff from a Syracuse, New York, airport Tuesday morning. Flight 1718, which was bound for New York City’s LaGuardia Airport, slid into a grassy area north of the runway, forcing passengers off the plane and onto buses back to the terminal, according to airport officials. No one was injured and the airport remained open.“During a departure taxi-out this morning, the nose gear of a Delta aircraft exited the paved surface of a taxiway,” Delta said in a statement. “This was not an airplane skidding off a runway.”Delta said the plane carried 58 customers and a flight crew of five.More than 400 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.The National Weather Service said that in New York, 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour or more was falling in higher elevations in the eastern Catskills through the mid-Hudson Valley, central Taconics and Berkshires. Wet, heavy snow snapped tree branches and downed power lines across New York’s capital region with power outages hitting homes and businesses in the Albany area.Dustin Reidy, a county legislator who lives in Albany, said he stocked up on groceries and prepared an emergency bin of candles, flashlights, and extra batteries ahead of the storm.“I don’t think the storm is as bad in my neck of the woods, but I give a lot of credit to the snow plows,” said Reidy, who was working from home. He said snow plows crews were outside since early morning to ensure roads were clear.The snowfall totals will be among the highest of the season, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the weather service office in College Park, Maryland.“It has been below average for snowfall across the Northeast this year, and so this nor'easter will be very impactful,"" he said.While higher elevations get snow, authorities warned residents in coastal areas to watch for possible flooding because of heavy rains. The National Weather Service in New York said wind gusts could reach 50 mph across Long Island and lower Connecticut.Rain was turning into snow across parts of New England with winds picking up and power outages reported across the region. In New Hampshire, it was Election Day for town officeholders, but more than 70 communities postponed voting because of the storm.In Kingston, New Hampshire, police offered voters rides to the polls. In Weare, power was knocked out at the polling place, forcing officials to set up battery-powered lights until a generator could be brought in. Interstate 93, the state’s main north-south route, was shut down in Londonderry in both directions around 12:30 p.m. after electrical wires came down across the highway.In Connecticut, state government offices and courts were closed Tuesday. State offices were also closed in New York.The weather service said expected snow totals from the storm, which is forecast to wind up Wednesday, range from more than 2 feet in higher elevations in New York, New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, to 4 to 6 inches in Boston.SeparatorMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

Ask Ameera Hammouda what she’s up to. Hammouda writes, photographs and shoots video for Boston Uncovered, a local guide and website that curates everything from what you should add to your Boston summer bucket list to where you can find a hidden rooftop garden with a pickleball court. “We're just very passionate Bostonians and we're connected to the city,” Hammouda told GBH’s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel. “We have a bunch of press connections, so we're constantly on the pulse of what's happening in the city and sharing it with our audience, whether that's on our website or on social media.”Boston Uncovered’s Instagram account recently passed 100,000 followers. Hammouda uses the platform to post videos of new restaurants, old favorites, cultural events, and some curated comedy skits from other local content creators. The goal is to act as a local guide, filling up Bostonians’ social calendars and turning them onto local businesses. And when summer comes and the city emerges from its winter doldrums, Boston Uncovered shines. “Summer's my favorite season,” Hammouda said. “I am a summer gal through and through. I was able to explore Boston Electric Boats last week, which is definitely now my summer favorite activity. I will be there all summer.”Boston Electric Boats lets people rent out small boats on Boston Harbor and captain the boats themselves without a boating license — though professional captains are available too.“It’s a completely private experience,” Hammouda said. “These boats go at top speeds of 6 miles per hour. It sounds slow, but you actually still get a good breeze. And they're out for 2 hours and the route is [predetermined]. So it's super easy. If you can trace a line, pretty much, you can steer this boat.”Or, if you prefer land-based activities, you can check out the Boston Pride for the People parade on Saturday, or the Bunker Hill Day Parade on Sunday. “It's historic, but it's also just a great way to be out in the sun and get your steps in,” she said. You can also check out the SoWa Open Market in Boston’s South End, open every Sunday until the end of October. “It's definitely not to be overlooked,” Hammouda said. “There's over 90 vendors this year so it's great if you have a big group and they all kind of want to do a different thing. You can eat. I'm a big foodie, so I like to head over to the food trucks. But they also have lawn games.”Or check out a restaurant, Hammouda said. If she had to pick one local restaurant to dine in for the rest of her life, she said, it would probably Oleana in Cambridge.“That is one of my favorite restaurants ever and never disappoints,” she said. “I also love Uni for sushi. It's a great, great spot.""She also recommended Nightshade Noodle Bar in Lynn, run by Chef Rachel Miller. “Funny story. Back in college, I was a sous chef, so I worked with her,” she said. “You will have the best meal of your life.”",Local,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:59:07 EST",7ab584908ad80c1179625850fe8ffe9e

Campbell shared the news amid a push from her office to raise awareness about legal protections for young people from labor abuses, especially in immigrant communities.“What we do see is a cross section of the children that are more likely to be exploited are children who live in low-income communities, immigrants, communities of color,” Campbell said. “That's not by accident, it’s the way systems are designed. That's where people go to exploit folks because of lack of information and language barriers.” The attorney general’s office is launching a child labor working group to “identify investigations targets” and develop new practices to enforce the labor laws on the books. Her office’s Fair Labor Division enforces the laws that govern youth employment. Within the past three years, the Office’s Fair Labor Division cited nearly 130 employers for violating Massachusetts child labor laws, with penalties totaling almost over $1.3 million. Those citations affected roughly 2,000 minors from across the state, according to Campbell. Her office later confirmed some of those employers subjugated immigrant minors to child labor exploitation.Between October 2021 to April 2023, over 4,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in Massachusetts, according to federal data from the Office of Refugee Resettlement. This number doesn’t include youth who arrived with their families. Campbell said the settlement with Dave & Buster's included $275,000 in restitution to resolve allegations of labor violations in multiple locations, a figure that includes compensation for more than 800 employees. The company was cited for not providing meal breaks of at least 30 minutes to employees who worked shifts lasting longer than six hours, not obtaining work permits for minors before they began employment and by employing 16- or 17-year-old minors for later hours than permitted by law. The complaint was launched by a parent who alleged their child was made to work past midnight on a weeknight.A spokesperson for Dave and Buster's could not be reached for comment. “Even over the past year, multiple fast-food restaurants and dining establishments across the state have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for violating child labor laws,” said Liam Quinn, youth programs director at the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety. “These violations include young people working too many hours, working with deep-fat fryers, high-speed ovens, and have resulted in multiple youth being burned.” Campbell said her office is issuing a guidance to remind employers of labor laws to ensure minors are safe at work, including a reminder of the state $15 hourly wage for workers age 15 and older. Minors under 14 cannot legally work, with the few exceptions of babysitting, working as a news carrier, working on farms, or working in entertainment with a special waiver. Campbell says her office is also meeting regularly with immigrant worker centers and providing know-your-rights education to vulnerable communities. It recently sent letters to all state public school superintendents responsible for issuing work permits to minors and fact sheets in multiple languages to be distributed among guardians of high school students about the rights of immigrant workers and labor trafficking. According to Gladys Vega, the executive director of the Chelsea-based service organization La Colaborativa, parents are often behind the long hours their children work. “Sometimes parents don't know any different. Sometimes parents are worried about paying the coyote they need to pay whatever they left behind in their country wherever they borrow the money to come here. So everyone in that family has to work,” she said. Vega said that at least 250 children work in Chelsea alone, and often parents rely on their teenagers’ checks for utility bills. In one instance, Vega said a 15-year-old skinned his finger on a machine in the deli department of a supermarket while he was working in a position he wasn’t supposed to be working in. Vega said it’s essential that employers and parents both made aware of the stringent child labor laws.",Local,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 19:08:39 EST",085bb356a7c91e1ea4ca77b45b4f9dba

The problem, skeptics argue, is that Trump isn’t like any other candidate. He violated norms and lied throughout his 2016 campaign and his four years in the White House. Most notoriously, he refused to accept Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election — a refusal that paved the way for his supporters’ assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But Trump is also the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, and his candidacy is undeniably newsworthy. Given that, is CNN’s approach as off-base as the network’s critics contend? And if it is, what would a better way to cover Trump’s second campaign as it unfolds? Adam Reilly discusses the past, present and future of Trump coverage with Dan Kennedy and Joanna Weiss of Northeastern University and Lylah Alphonse of the Boston Globe. Do you think the media should cover Trump differently than other 2024 candidates? If so, how? Send us a message at TalkingPolitics@wgbh.org, or share your thoughts via the Talking Politics page.

1322,Feds launch civil rights investigation into Harvard's admissions practices,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/07/25/feds-launch-civil-rights-investigation-into-harvards-admissions-practices,The initial complaint argued that donor and legacy admissions preferences disadvantage students of color.,"The U.S. Department of Education has officially opened an investigation into Harvard University's donor and legacy admissions preferences in response to a federal civil rights complaint filed earlier this month.Lawyers for Civil Rights in Boston, who is representing the Greater Boston area nonprofits that filed the discrimination complaint, announced the investigation at a press conference Tuesday morning. Litigation director Oren Sellstrom said colleges that refuse to drop donor and legacy preferencing will one day be seen as ""outliers.""""Simply put, Harvard is on the wrong side of history,” Sellstrom said at the press confrence.According to the complaint, students who receive special donor and legacy preferences are significantly more likely to be accepted than other applicants, and constitute up to 15% of Harvard’s admitted students. Harvard issued a statement that said the university was already reviewing its admissions policies in the wake of last month's Supreme Court decision severely curtailing the consideration of race in college admissions.""Our review includes examination of a range of data and information, along with learnings from Harvard’s efforts over the past decade to strengthen our ability to attract and support a diverse intellectual community that is fundamental to our pursuit of academic excellence,"" Harvard's statement read. ""As this work continues, and moving forward, Harvard remains dedicated to opening doors to opportunity and to redoubling our efforts to encourage students from many different backgrounds to apply for admission.”The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights will undertake the investigation and review the case. ""Please note that opening the complaint for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination on the merits of the complaint,"" the agency said in a letter. ""During the investigation, OCR is a neutral factfinder, collecting and analyzing relevant evidence from the Complainant, the University, and other sources, as appropriate.""They did not offer a timeline for a decision.The initial complaint was filed by Lawyers for Civil Rights on behalf of three Greater Boston nonprofits: the Chica Project, African Community Economic Development of New England and the Greater Boston Latino Network.It argued that it's even more important to eliminate policies that systematically disadvantage students of color in the zero sum game of college admissions. Nearly 70% of Harvard’s donor-related and legacy applicants are white and receive a significant boost based on their class and alumni family status. Donor-related applicants are nearly seven times more likely to be admitted than non-donor-related applicants; and legacies are nearly six times more likely to be admitted, according to the complaint. Nearly one in three members of the class of 2019, for example, were legacies with a parent or other relative who went to Harvard. Student advocates have said that as a result, qualified and highly deserving applicants of color are harmed because admissions slots are given overwhelmingly to white applicants. A new survey of elite college enrollment also released this week found that very wealthy students are much more likely to be admitted to highly selective colleges compared to middle- and lower-income students.Researchers at Harvard, Brown and Stanford studied what factors lead high-income students to be more likely to attend selective colleges and then land prestigious jobs. They found that the wealthiest students from the very top of the income distribution were more than twice as likely to be admitted to Ivy League and other prestigious colleges than students from middle-income homes.“Having the gateway to those positions at these schools be particularly open to students from the top of the parental income distribution isn't going to give us that broad opportunity for students from all backgrounds,"" said economist John Friedman, who led the study. Friedman said there are some changes to admission policies that would immediately increase socioeconomic diversity on and off campus, including dropping legacy preferences for the children of alumni.This is a developing story and will be updated throughout the day.",Education,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 13:56:19 EST",f339099c7e36048640b70c4bf7beca9e

What can I grow, say, on my window? —Paris Alston, co-host, GBH’s Morning EditionThere are plenty of options, Epstein said. He suggested microgreens, parsley or basil in sunnier spots. One thing to avoid: tomatoes.“You need pollination with the tomatoes, and I'm sure you don't want to start putting bees in the house and things like that,” he said. “They also need good airflow. Tomatoes just don't do well inside. You can do it, but you'd need special grow lights.”Memorial Day is almost here. Are we out of frost season? What should I plant?That’s likely, Epstein said. “I don't see any frost this morning, although there are some places on the Vineyard that are in the mid-30s, so there could be a little bit of light frost down there this morning,” he said. “We're kind of out of what I see as a frost window, so if you want to put stuff out, go ahead.”Some things to try planting: Impatiens and begonias, which bloom beautifully and add color. “I put mine in yesterday,” Epstein said. “For pops of color where you don't get a lot of sun, impatiens work great, begonias work great.”Also likely good to go: Tomatoes and peppers. One thing to wait to plant outdoors: Basil. “Basil really should wait to go out until nights are above 50,” he said. There are so many kinds of tomato plants out there. Which kinds should I buy?Seek out a variety of plants, Epstein said. “Get some varieties that are disease resistant, and also throw in a couple of heirlooms,” he said. “The heirlooms are not as disease resistant. So if we did have a very damp summer where we had some disease moving through the area, the heirlooms tend to get the disease easier than some of the hybridized varieties which are not susceptible to things like welt and other bacterial diseases.”Mix it up, he said. When planting, keep 30 to 36 inches between plants to promote airflow. If all goes well, tomato plants will start bearing fruit later this summer. “Generally, if you get your plants that are about a foot to maybe a foot and a half tall right now, you'll start to get some flowers here in early July,” he said. “You may get your first tomatoes mid to late July, depending on the variety. Most tomatoes come in late July through the month of August.”",Local,"Tue, 23 May 2023 10:44:14 EST",18744f23ee3ea893f60aff38f7f67809
2851,What role will local journalism play in Ukraine's resistance and recovery?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2023/05/29/what-role-will-local-journalism-play-in-ukraines-resistance-and-recovery,"Charlie Sennott, founder and editor-in-chief of the Groundtruth Project, spoke about his trip to Bucha.","The war in Ukraine has been going for almost a year an a half, since Russian troops escalated their invasion in February 2022. Charlie Sennott, founder and editor in chief of the Groundtruth Project, just returned from Kyiv and joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to discuss his experience. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: First of all, Charlie, what took you to Kyiv? Charlie Sennott: So I was there to attend two conferences. The first one was actually in Ukraine. It was in the city of Bucha, which all of us remember as a city that was just ravaged in the very earliest stages of the war. Many experts would say the opening chapter of an indictment on war crimes will be set in Bucha. That was where the bodies were left in the streets, many with their hands tied behind their backs. They had been killed. They had been mutilated. There were allegations of systematic rape and torture. And really, really the worst stuff that we saw right away that would come in even more depth and with even more ferocity later in the war. But this was this was that first scene.So really, I cannot tell you what it was like to go to Bucha for the first annual, as they put it, Bucha Journalism Conference, where they brought together a lot of the journalists who cover the war for the Western media. So The New York Times was there and The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the BBC. But also, and really importantly, it was many of the top Ukrainian journalists who were able to take a moment and pull back to Bucha. And there were 200 local reporters from Ukraine there. And it was really quite a unique gathering, a powerful gathering, a gathering, sort of, of solidarity around the role that journalism will play in actually putting forward the evidence that will be required for a war crimes tribunal or some form of bringing Putin and Russia to account for what they've done in Bucha. If we have time, the scenes there are just amazing, because it's rebuilding and it's coming back. Alston: That sounds really profound, Charlie. And I want to talk more about the role of local journalism there. But as you were leaving, Russia launched its largest drone attack since the beginning of the war on Kyiv, just as the city was preparing to mark Kyiv Day, which celebrates the founding of the city more than 1,500 years ago. What's the mood there? Sennott: The mood is exhausted, and the mood is a sense that this is a fateful hour. There have been large-scale missile attacks, but never until yesterday had there been so many in Kyiv. And that was what made yesterday unique. We've had 40 missile attacks on Ukraine in a single day before, but this was 50 in Kyiv. And so it was really Putin raining chaos and fear down upon the city of Kyiv.And the stunning reality of being there is, you know, the first thing you hear at about three in the morning are air raid sirens going off, which are quickly followed by this sort of thud of the Patriot missiles going out from their positions in and around Kyiv to protect the city. And it's hard for us to know for sure, it's hard to get a lot of ground truth on whether or not those missiles are coming through. But from what the military is saying, 49 out of 50 were knocked out of the sky by the Patriot missile system. And it has been around for a long time. We remember this missile system from the first Gulf War, when it needed improvements. And now I have to say, being there in Kyiv and seeing how effective it is, it's an amazing protective system that is guarding the city. And it appeared to be working yesterday after the sort of pre-dawn hours of typically when the air strikes came in, there were then about a dozen more missile attacks that came in, and drone attacks that came in to Kyiv. And so this was really one of the the absolute worst days. And I thought so much of my colleagues from Ukrainska Pravda, which is one of the leading newspapers in Ukraine, and many others who were leaving that conference and would have been returning yesterday, and what they came home to and what they have to look forward to as the country braces for the counteroffensive, which will, you know, presumably be underway any moment, if not already underway. And my guess is the latter. I think it's already underway in different ways. The whole country feels just like it's bracing for what is the fateful hour in this conflict. Ukraine and the Ukrainian forces are prepared. They're ready to go. They have an arsenal and they have a plan. And the moment is now. And the next weeks, months will be critical. Alston: We should mention that NPR has been reporting this morning that Russia may have been trying to weaken that counteroffensive even before it began. Sennott: And to be more precise, what I think and I've heard they're doing — and it made sense to me — is they're trying to keep those Patriot missiles in Kyiv so that they don't try to move them forward to protect ground forces that will be staging the operation for the counteroffensive. They want them to stay pulled back into Kyiv. The Russians want to keep them in Kyiv, that is. They want to keep those missile systems, those defensive systems, pinned down in Kyiv so they can't be deployed for in a forward way for Ukraine. That makes sense to me. And the surreal thing, Paris, about being in Kyiv in the days that I was there and what I've heard from people overnight is: These missiles come in, they're taken out by the Patriot, and life goes back to normal. And that's in huge air quotes, 'normal.' But you can actually feel that Kyiv is trying very hard to maintain that resiliency, to reflect who it is as a country. And the day they chose to attack yesterday is actually called Kyiv Day. And it celebrates the foundation of the city more than 1,500 years ago. And it's just a profound expression of how ancient the city is, how meaningful it is. And the way it defines that part of the world. Its history is storied and important, and the culture is beautiful and strong. And the people of Ukraine, you can feel it on the ground, are so united in defense of their country. Alston: And really quickly, Charlie, because we're running out of time here. But I do want to hear just in the last maybe 15 seconds we have here, what is the role that local journalism is playing in spite of everything going on? Sennott: Thanks for asking. Local journalism in Ukraine is critical. I mean, imagine if we were at war, we'd need those reports from the Midwest. We'd need those reports from the Mississippi Delta or wherever the attacks might be happening, that we don't have eyes on the ground as a people or as larger news organizations. So they play a very critical role for the local communities, to say what's happening and where things are headed and what services are available and where you need to go and what roads are dangerous, etc. But it's important in another way, which is the local journalism becomes the way in which this country will pull itself back together, I think. And I think really having accountability reporting going forward for Ukraine as all of that money for reconstruction comes in — this is hundreds of billions of dollars, much needed. But local journalism will play an incredibly important role as eyes on the ground, making sure that money is spent the way it was intended to be spent. Corruption is an issue in Ukraine. It always has been. And I think the journalists are incredible at holding those government officials accountable. And I think this gathering was a sort of gathering of strength for journalism to say we have a role to play here on the front lines covering the war, but also in representing local communities. Report for The World, our organization, we partner with Ukrainska Pravda. We're really proud to do it. And it's important work they're doing, of course, but the local angles are as important as the big national reporting.",International News,"Mon, 29 May 2023 14:38:53 EST",55f0468888938ebd0912d346ac24c5a2

Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.Warm weather is usually a good thing this time of year, but are we still a little too hot for where we should be? Yesterday we had a high of 74 and a low of 52, five degrees above average. In fact, the temperature has been above average most of the month so far. But, Epstein said, May was quite cool at the beginning, when it was in the 50s. “So the first five or six days of the month, we were running below average — add that in with what's happened since, we're now running four degrees for the month above average. And to run a month four degrees above average is a lot,” he said.Epstein said we usually see four 80-degree days during the entire month of May, and we have already had three, plus today. He said we will continue to see the warmer trend.“Like most of our months now, they just end up being above average by some amount,” he said. “We just don't get many below averages each month.” How is the warm, dry weather affecting fire conditions and my yard? Epstein noted that Logan Airport has seen .28 inches of rainfall this month, while normally it would see 1.53 inches.“That's a huge deficit in rainfall this month. We're behind by an inch and a quarter,” he said. “And I really don't see much chance of any rain until sometime maybe Sunday.” Starting this afternoon, we could start to see the impacts of that dryness. “Lawns are going to start burning out, and plants — it's going to dry things out really quite a bit this afternoon and tomorrow,” he said. “Dew points and temperature are going to be so far apart that our relative humidity — the gap between the two — will be similar to what you'd find in the desert.”What impact does the weather have on allergies right now? Why does it seem worse at night?Epstein said that trees and grasses do release more pollen overnight. “So if your windows are open at night, it actually goes up at night,” he said.Dryness also comes into play to make allergies worse. “We haven't had any rain to cleanse the air,” he said.",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 11:59:48 EST",6c14bec80eaeec394d46471b3326c5ff
6842,Former public safety secretary ‘shocked’ by reports that DCF puts foster youth’s funds into state coffers,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/12/former-public-safety-secretary-shocked-by-reports-that-dcf-puts-foster-youths-funds-into-state-coffers,Andrea Cabral joined Boston Public Radio to discuss the $15 million in the last three years.,"Andrea Cabral, Massachusetts’ former secretary of public safety, says she was “shocked” by the recent reports that Massachusetts government has long diverted funds for children in foster care to the state’s coffers. The Department of Children and Families puts the majority of the money from those children who receive social security benefits into the state’s general fund. These funds, intended for children with disabilities or those who have experienced the loss of a parent, have exceeded $15 million in the past three years, the Boston Globe found. “I sort of think of myself who’s not easily shocked. This actually shocked me,” Cabral said on Boston Public Radio Wednesday. “While it’s shocking, in some ways it’s not surprising. Unfortunately, when you’re in government, the notion of what the general fund is entitled to is read very, very, very expansively.”Federal funds taken out of the children’s hands could be put toward education or housing once they age out of the foster care system. Many struggle to find stable housing or become homeless in the years after leaving foster homes. One study estimated that roughly one-third of foster youth were homeless at least once by the time they turned 26. “I always thought DCF always came under the gun, was routinely underfunded and expected its people to jump faster and leap higher with a fraction of the money,” Cabral said, saying that she has often defended the agency. “But in this particular case, DCF knows the challenges that kids who age out of foster care face — particularly the financial ones. Inability to continue education, homelessness, drug addiction — all of those things.”Cabral says the state could have set up bank accounts for the children in its care, like savings accounts designed for future education expenses or people with disabilities. “DCF put it into the general fund, which means that the money that was designed to go to these kids went for other legislative priorities — having absolutely nothing to do with them,” she said. DCF spokesperson Andrea Grossman has defended the agency’s actions, writing in a statement to the Globe that the agency “complies with all current federal laws regarding the use of Social Security benefits for children in foster care.” Cabral says she assumes there will be a lawsuit on its way. “I actually think that all of these kids are entitled to those benefits that they didn’t receive, no matter how old they are now,” she said. “It’s almost a difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law in terms of how the Social Security Administration intended for these benefits to go to these kids.”Reporting from NPR and the Marshall Project in 2021 showed that the majority of states take a similar approach to the benefits. Since then, the Globe reports, a few states have pushed forward legislation that would ban the practice. In Massachusetts, lawmakers introduced a bill earlier this year that would mandate increased documentation and reporting procedures around the benefits granted to children under state custody. Cabral underscored that, per Globe reporting, the DCF policy of putting money in the general fund has been a longstanding practice. “After a while, you know, a short while, it becomes a habit — and it becomes something that the general fund both expects and relies on,” she said. “And as long as no one says anything, it would continue.”",Local,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 20:26:39 EST",a0af870f5797ad5cd2ed0b385a1f370d

A round of applause broke out in the Senate chamber after the 39-0 vote on a bill that Sen. Jo Comerford said would allow “gender representation on state documents and IDs to be as beautifully diverse as the people in our commonwealth.”Comerford’s bill would let people more easily change their gender — to male, female or a gender-neutral “X” marker — on birth certificates, and codify the Registry of Motor Vehicles’ current practice of offering “X” as a gender option on driver’s licenses, permits and other ID cards. People will no longer be required to provide medical documentation when they request such a change. The bill also directs state officials to develop a plan, including a timeline and cost estimates, for rolling out a nonbinary gender designation on all state forms and documents. “People know what gender they are. They don't need a doctor's note or the state to tell them,” said Comerford, one of three Senate members of the Legislature’s LGBTQ Caucus. “Our current binary options are archaic, limited and overly restrictive, and have created a situation where government is infringing on people's civil right to self-identify.”Before the final vote, senators adopted an amendment from Andover Sen. Barry Finegold that would also allow for gender changes and nonbinary gender markers on Massachusetts marriage certificates. Comerford, a Northampton Democrat, said an ""X"" gender designation is now available on passports, and that 16 states and Washington, D.C., allow the same designation on birth certificates. At least 22 states and D.C. currently have ""X"" a gender option on driver's licenses, she said. The second bill senators passed on Thursday directs the RMV to develop a process through which people experiencing homelessness can apply for a state ID card without paying a fee or providing address information. Sen. Robyn Kennedy’s bill would let adults and unaccompanied youth prove their Massachusetts residency by providing alternative documents, like papers from a shelter or other service provider.“Imagine for a moment that your barrier to obtaining employment, applying for housing and gaining access to health insurance was simply a matter of providing adequate identification, and that without your Massachusetts state ID, you would be unable to acquire the most basic of human needs, such as food,” said Kennedy, a Worcester Democrat. “For approximately 20,000 people living in the commonwealth, this is a reality, and obtaining state identification is the first critical step in accomplishing typical life tasks that can lift them out of homelessness.” The Senate’s votes Thursday send the pair of bills to the House for consideration. Last session, the Senate unanimously passed similar bills, and each died after the House Ways and Means Committee did not act on them.",Politics,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 16:32:32 EST",55c0d777a707ba5efc756cd7b4c7fc96
1406,"Lawmakers, advocates call for faster rollout on local fossil fuel bans",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/23/lawmakers-advocates-call-for-faster-rollout-on-local-fossil-fuel-bans,Some Massachusetts cities and towns will soon be able to ban fossil fuels in new construction.,"Last year, Massachusetts legislators approved a pilot program to let 10 cities and towns ban fossil fuels in new buildings. Now, lawmakers and advocates are urging the state to streamline how municipalities participate and let them start doing it — soon. “It's important that state government permit the towns that want to do this to go forward as quickly as possible,” state Sen. Mike Barrett told GBH News. “The Legislature wrote this language because a handful of towns had already moved way out in front. The communities had gone through the laborious process of drafting local bylaws and ordinances.” The state’s Department of Energy Resources released draft regulations and a model rule at the end of December, soliciting public comment up through last week. The law mandates that, for participating communities, both new construction and major renovations would have to be fossil fuel–free operations, with some exceptions for settings like research labs and hospitals. Under DOER’s proposed regulations, municipalities that have already asked the state for permission to ban fossil fuels in new construction, via a home-rule petition sent to Beacon Hill, would need to wait until early 2024 at the earliest to implement their bans. It “proposes to delay the entire process much longer than the Legislature ever imagined,” Barrett said. Many are impatient to get the ball rolling after then-Gov. Charlie Baker signed the legislation last summer, which will go into effect July 1. In addition to moving up the timeline, some lawmakers worry about red tape baked into the DOER’s drafts that could create a stop-start process as each municipality vies for state approval, one by one. Advocacy groups also raised broader concerns that restricting the pilot program to just 10 communities could create problems of its own: holding the state back in meeting its energy goals, and deepening inequity because many of the first cities and towns to apply for this program are wealthy municipalities. “The Department of Energy of Resources appreciates all comments and will take them into consideration as it works to finalize regulations for the Municipal Fossil Fuel Free Building Demonstration Program and implement them as quickly as practicable,” wrote Danielle Burney in an email, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, which oversees the DOER. The law requires that the first 10 cities and towns to send home-rule petitions to the State House should get priority to participate. But at least some of those first 10 communities will likely not be able to take part because of legislative guardrails on the program. Worried about stymying new construction in municipalities where affordable housing is already in short supply, the law requires all participants to either meet an affordable housing threshold or certain zoning code requirements. Arlington, for one, is first in line for the project — but it falls below the state’s affordable housing threshold. Talia Fox, the town’s sustainability manager, is confident Arlington will ultimately qualify for the project and that it plans to modify its zoning bylaws. “And we’ve designed the timeline of that process so that we are eligible to participate in the fossil fuel–free demonstration project,” she told GBH News. Those who ultimately do not qualify will be able to withdraw from the program to make way for other cities and towns to take their place. State Rep. Mike Connolly represents both Cambridge and Somerville on Beacon Hill. While Cambridge is one of the first 10 communities and has a spot in the program, Somerville was the 11th to submit its petition to the Legislature. City and state officials who represent the city are pushing the DOER to include it in their program, and speed up the evaluation of ”substitute” communities who do not fall in the prioritized group. “I want to strongly urge DOER to consider both prioritized communities and substitute applications on a rolling basis,” Connolly wrote. “Our legislative intent was to establish a demonstration program that could effectively be used to collect data and prove the viability of the fossil fuel free building concept, and the value of the program will be enhanced if we can get to a place where a full set of ten participating municipalities are all able to get going with the program as quickly as possible.”Soon after Somerville filed its petition, Boston did the same, asking the state for permission to ban new fossil fuel hookups. A 2021 city report found that 69% of Boston’s emissions come from buildings. Electric companies like National Grid also pointed to the need for clarity on what demands each new all-electric development will put on the electric grid. The company suggested, in a written comment, that customers “should be required to consult with their local electric distribution company to ensure that the local electric system infrastructure is equipped to accommodate alternatives to fossil fuel on a case-by-case basis.” Other advocates say the state needs to allow more municipalities to go fossil fuel free, a change that would have to come from the Legislature. Lisa Cunningham is the co-founder of ZeroCarbonMA and has pushed for Brookline to ban fossil fuel hookups for years. She pointed out that many of the “substitute” communities hoping for approval — such as Boston and Somerville — represent a huge part Massachusetts’ population and have much larger poor and minority populations. Northampton, meanwhile, is the only community in Western Massachusetts that is looking to take part. “It really seems counterproductive to limit the number of communities in this pilot program, arbitrarily limit them to 10 communities,” Cunningham said. “It's not fair, from an equity point of view, really — it's not fair from an environmental justice point of view — to allow all these relatively wealthy communities to have first-come, first-serve at this program and then to exclude these other communities.” Logan Malik, the interim executive director of the Massachusetts Climate Action Network, agreed. “We know that the future is electric. We know that we will need to electrify our buildings, and communities across the commonwealth deserve the right, the opportunity, to decide for themselves,” he added. Much of Massachusetts’ fossil fuel hookup debate has centered on Brookline for the past several years. The town passed local rules that would ban fossil fuels in new construction — twice — but they were halted by then-Attorney General Maura Healey, who said there needed to be action at the state level for such a change to legally go forward in Massachusetts. Brookline is one of the 10 communities that will be eligible to participate in the pilot program.Barrett argues that urgency is essential, beyond the impacts of just the first 10 cities and towns, because the hope is that data gathered from the pioneering communities will help create a roadmap forward for how to meet the state’s ambitious climate goals. “The additional delays anticipated by the draft regulation mean that we will remain in the dark about how to move forward on our climate strategy for additional months,” the senator said. “We’re hoping the state hears us and hastens the process along.”",Local,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:48:43 EST",ac75e09a6b07a797a53b9c796183e9e5
5431,"As the climate changes, obsolete dams put Mass. at risk for flooding similar to Vermont",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/14/as-the-climate-changes-obsolete-dams-put-mass-at-risk-for-flooding-similar-to-vermont,A dam near Vermont’s capital city nearly overflowed as it saw devastating floods.,"With flooding in Western Massachusetts, Vermont and New York following recent torrential downpours, experts say thousands of obsolete and often crumbling dams across Massachusetts puts the state at increased risk. That risk only grows, they say, as climate change makes severe storms more common.“A lot of these dams are really old,” said Cathy Bozek of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “A lot of them were built to power old mills [and] factories, and they’re not being used anymore. They’re obsolete dams, and many of these dams are not being maintained. They are in unsafe condition and are subject to failing during heavy storms.”Of the roughly 3,000 dams in Massachusetts, about 1,300 are large enough to be listed in the National Inventory of Dams kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Of those, 328 are ranked as having “high hazard potential.” “Which means that loss of life and significant damage to homes, buildings, infrastructure is likely if the dam fails,” Bozek said. ""An additional 643 are 'significant hazard' rated. And that means that there may not be loss of life, but it can cause significant economic loss, environmental damage and disruption of lifeline facilities."" In Vermont’s capital, Montpelier, officials said early Tuesday morning that the nearby high-hazard Wrightsville Dam was close to capacity. Overflowing had “never happened since the dam was built so there is no precedent for potential damage,” City Manager William Fraser warned. The water level ultimately subsided, but the city was still left with extensive destruction: many businesses and Montpelier’s City Hall are closed while they recover, and one man died.In Massachusetts, Bozek recalled the near-failure of the Whittington Dam in Taunton in 2005 during a strong storm. Thousands of people were told to evacuate the city’s downtown, which sits about a half-mile downstream from the dam. ""They had to declare a state of emergency,"" Bozek said. ""That one ended up having emergency repairs and they were able to save the dam and there was no loss of life. But it was a huge risk, and Massachusetts certainly is in danger of seeing significant flooding and infrastructure damage from dam failures in the future."" Standing by the Watertown Dam in Watertown on Wednesday, Robert Kearns of the Charles River Watershed Association pointed to rushing water and recalled a spring Nor’easter in 2010 that brought days of rain to the area. “Back in the 2010 storm, the water on the opposite side of the river came over the earthen embankment and really went over and around the dam,” he said. “A lot of these structures are just either totally left forgotten or are really not designed for the strongest storms, the more increased rainfall that we're seeing here in the Northeast with climate change.” The Watertown Dam is owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Kearns said, and the Charles River Watershed Association is pushing for the department to remove it. “We’re really hoping that they'll make the right decision,” he said. DCR did not make anyone available for an interview, but a spokesperson sent a statement regarding the recent storm. “Dams overflow for a number of reasons, including weather conditions and a blockage of water flow. However, a dam overflow is not the same as a dam failure,” the spokesperson said in the written statement. “So far, there have not been any dam failures or emergency conditions reported to the Office of Dam Safety following the recent weather conditions. We will continue to monitor dams across the state and will respond to any reports of emergencies or failures.” Several dam removals are underway in Massachusetts, including a current project at the High Street Dam in Bridgewater, Bozek said. One barrier to removal — the high cost associated with carefully taking down a dam — eased after billions of dollars were made available under the 2021 federal infrastructure bill. “Through the bipartisan infrastructure bill and other funding opportunities, we’re bringing a lot of support for these projects, and we’re able to move a lot of them forward,” Bozek said. “And so, we’re seeing great progress in working with the dam owners, working with communities and really bringing a lot of these projects into implementation.”In the case of a dam overflowing or failing in Massachusetts, Kearns said there's not enough publicly available information about what the likely impact would be.“Here in Massachusetts, there's not a database online where the public and first responders can go and look at if a dam were to fail ... where would that water go?” Kearns said. “That information is in the emergency action plan that some first responders have, but it's not as publicly available as in other states like California, where ... you can look up every dam that's a significant or high hazard dam and see, if that were to fail, where that water would go.”FEMA’s flood maps for the commonwealth are also outdated, he said.“A lot of the areas that have flooded in Vermont are not in the FEMA flood zones,” Kearns said. “So, FEMA flood zones are based on past data ... past floods. But we’re seeing floods today that we haven't seen in the past.”Some cities, like Boston, have updated flood maps that project into a future impacted by climate change.“But really, the state really needs to do this across the whole commonwealth because people are going to be vulnerable,” Kearns said.Making that kind of information more widely available, piece by piece, is one of the ways the Charles River Watershed Association is trying to address the problem.They worked with 20 cities and towns along the Charles River to create a simulation of flooding along the Charles, using climate projections for 2030 and 2070.“With our regional outlook, we’re better able to understand inland flooding impacts and determine the most effective solutions,” said the Rev. Vernon K. Walker, program director of Climate CREW (Communities Responding to Extreme Weather), which is helping CRWA with community engagement on the project.Using those projections, the project is helping those municipalities make changes now to prevent flooding in the future.“We’re looking at building green storm water infrastructure,” Walker said. “We’re looking at reducing impervious cover. We’re looking at land conservation and increasing the tree canopy. And all these are potential opportunities for flood water storage.”And for when those floods eventually do hit, Climate CREW is prepared to give community members “to-go” emergency bags with items like flashlights, can openers and waterproof matches.Correction: This story was updated to clarify the roles of the Charles River Watershed Association and Climate CREW in the flooding simulation project and outreach.",Local,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 19:27:24 EST",7e64b564d489463a19c6e2f6e7777b57

Who are they? A gaggle of D.C.'s most talented teens! The members of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts concert choir joined Bono and The Edge for their Tiny Desk performance. Kirsten Holmes and Jevon Skipper are both students at the arts-centered school in Washington, D.C, and received a call from their choir director about a month earlier with the opportunity to join the rock stars in performing. The two vocalists, who aspire to use their talents to dip into the worlds of gospel, opera and R&B music, agreed to the performance with a few other classmates and members of the choir. What's the big deal? It's a Tiny Desk! Enough said, right? The performance features four songs, including a version of ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of ""Walk On."" The performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender. Though that may not have immediately impressed Kirsten and Jevon as much as some others. The Gen Z duo admitted they weren't very familiar with the Irish crooners and their band. (I guess they never had to deal with the shock of an unsolicited album showing up on their iTunes one fateful morning in 2014.) What are they saying? On learning about Bono's existence: Kirsten: I had found out prior... but [because] my parents [know]. Jevon: Not even my parents. My dad. Because I know my dad was like, 'Look them up!' So I look them up, and I see they performed at the Super Bowl. I'm like, 'Oh, they must be like big news if they're performing at the Super Bowl.' Kirsten: We're youngins. You know, we are young, so we're still learning and stuff, but it's just a wow moment. On meeting Bono: Kirsten: [He was] really chill, like down down to earth. And I love how they weren't big headed, because I know how sometimes when you're in the presence of someone with a higher status, it could be really intimidating. And I didn't feel like any of us felt intimidation from them. It was just really like a learning experience. They were like, 'Well, what do you think will fit good in this part?' Jevon: One of our friends, by accident, didn't get the words right. So he accidentally sung the wrong thing. And Bono was like, 'Oh, wait, what did you do?' He was like, 'I like that, man.' It was fun. It was funny because we all knew it was an accident, but then we kind of went along with it and Bono liked it. So we just did it. On the joy of performing: Kirsten: It was amazing, really happy. I think my moment was just seeing the people's reaction, just to allow other people to feel the enjoyment of what we are gifted to do. And it was just really good. Javon: I guess I just like the feeling that I can make someone's day with the gift that God gave me. Ever since I was younger, I just loved singing for people and making people feel better and just encouraging people. So, what now?

6047,'Raw Dog' explores the flavors and controversies of America’s favorite tubed meat,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/02/raw-dog-explores-the-flavors-and-controversies-of-americas-favorite-tubed-meat,Comedian Jamie Loftus’ new book is about hot dogs and our sometimes complicated relationship to them.,"One summer, comedian Jamie Loftus ate hundreds of hot dogs at some 150 joints across the country. Loftus chronicled that hot dog summer in her new book “Raw Dog.” It’s essential reading about America’s favorite summer food and our occasionally complicated relationship to it.“There’s very little written about hot dogs, which is crazy to me,” Loftus said on Boston Public Radio on Friday. Loftus said most of what she read before writing this book was either “very pro-hot dog” or “the vegan lobby.” “I was excited to look at the pros and cons of hot dogs,” she said. Many people consider the hot dog an quintessentially American food, but the pink meat tube was born from a combination of food traditions from Germany, Greece, Poland and Austria, Loftus said.""Over a period of time, there were so many immigrants coming to the U.S. from those countries during the Depression and during the World Wars, and it just became a popular cheap food,"" she explained. During her hot dog tour, Loftus ate everything from a fish cake hot dog in Philly (a well-cooked hot dog with a fish cake flopped on top) to a bologna-wrapped and fried dog in Baltimore. Eating so many hot dogs was not always easy on the body, Loftus said. “I felt like I was on the verge of death,” she said about eating the Baltimore dog mere hours after enjoying a chili-drenched hot dog from Ben’s Chili Bowl.Her favorite hot dog stop in the country? Rutt’s Hut in Clifton, New Jersey. “They put it in the deep fryer for 4 seconds, and it just explodes,” said Loftus. “It costs like $3 on the side of the highway and it’s just the greatest thing in the world.” But after trying so many grilled, boiled and fried dogs that summer, Loftus says she prefers to keep it classic: a hot dog, split and grilled, on a toasted bun with ketchup, mustard and relish.Beyond the tastebud trials in her book, Loftus also explores the labor conditions for meatpackers and slaughterhouse workers who create the tubed meat. She said the already dangerous meatpacking plants remained open during the pandemic, and “it became the most dangerous job in the country.”In 2022, ProPublica published an investigation that revealed meatpacking giants Tyson and Smithfield ignored pandemic health warnings and pushed back against public health officials, exposing their workers to the coronavirus.Outrage over working conditions has spilled over into more joyous hotdog events, like the Nathan’s Hot Dog eating contest. Protestors in 2022 crossed in front of famed eater Joey Chestnut with a sign that read “Expose Smithfield Death Star.” This was a great event to protest at, said Loftus, because Smithfield distributes a lot of Nathan's hot dogs. Loftus also writes about another hot dog cultural touchstone, the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. She interviewed drivers of the hot dog-shaped vehicles, most fresh out of college when they took on this yearlong job. Before getting behind the wheel, they attend training in Wisconsin for two weeks. Then the company pairs up its 12 drivers to take six Wienermobiles across the country and hand out Wienermobile-shaped whistles.“They basically put you into an arranged marriage with another Wienermoble driver, and then you're just with them nonstop for six months,” said Loftus. “And it ends with them either hating each other or getting married.”",Local,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 15:01:08 EST",fd1769cf9a7345e2a3e24507b6ef4ad1

Howard had become wealthy through the shipping trade, and while there is no record of him shipping slaves, he was moving cargo that was harvested by enslaved people, including logwood and tobacco. Howard’s wealth from that business allowed him to build a home of relative grandeur for the period.The Revere family moved into the home in 1770, five years before Paul Revere’s famous “midnight ride” to alert the countryside of the impending British assault. They sold the property in 1800.Revere’s other brush with the slave industry comes from his trade as a silversmith. Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts notes in its Revere silver collection that while Paul Revere likely melted down old coins or silver objects for his raw material, “the metal itself likely came from Mexico, mined by enslaved laborers.”Then, of course, there were his customers: wealthy Bostonians who may have enslaved people themselves or made their money through the slave trade. One of Revere’s most famous pieces is the “Sons of Liberty Bowl,” which he made to commemorate the heroes of the American Revolution. Among the names engraved on the bowl is Daniel Malcolm, who died in 1769. According to the city of Boston’s slavery database, probate records from that year show he enslaved two people.“This system [slavery] touched everyone,” including artists and patrons of the arts, said Ethan Lasser, chair of the Art of the Amercia’s department at the MFA. “Many of the people involved with the Liberty Bowl are the same patrons of portraits and furniture. And a lot of their wealth is either directly or indirectly connected to the Caribbean and to slavery.”SeparatorThis story is part of the project Enslavement History of the Freedom Trail, a collaborative effort between GBH News and Boston University students to detail the mostly hidden history behind some of Boston's most well-known sites.",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 05:00:56 EST",ae2dc3925e347753f25748cb20a3d03a

Caleb has a diagnosis of an extremely rare, life-threatening condition called cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD. The disease took the life of Caleb’s cousin, Evan, when he was just 9 years old, pushing Caleb and his brother Tyler to both get tested. Both boys ended up having the genetic mutation that could lead to CALD. In December of last year, Caleb’s lesions began to appear. Teams of doctors and specialists led them to Boston from their home in Ohio, and he’ll be undergoing a new type of gene therapy at Mass General: Skysona, a treatment approved by the FDA last fall, that could save his life. Caleb’s parents, Shauna and Lonnie McMillan, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to tell Caleb’s story, share each step of the journey and explain where they’ll go from here. Arun Rath: Shauna, take us back to when you decided to take your boys to be tested. Had you ever heard about this disease before what happened with Caleb’s cousin, Evan? Shauna McMillan: Well, kind of, but not really. When I was eight years old, I watched [the movie] “Lorenzo’s Oil,” and it was about a little boy with ALD. So back in the past, I had heard of it, but I never imagined it would have affected our family like this. It all just kind of flashed back. With this diagnosis, we just right away knew with it being an X-linked disorder, I could have inherited it and passed it on. So right after we had suspicions and genetic testing back for Evan, we had both of the boys immediately tested. After about two weeks, we had our results back, and we were able to confirm the diagnosis. Rath: As a parent, it’s hard for me to get my mind around what that would be like. You can’t be paralyzed, so what do you do from there?Lonnie McMillan: We were fortunate enough to be put in touch with some other people who had gone through this. We learned pretty quickly about what the whole journey would be like. There’s a lot of different ways that it can go. Every six months, they have to get MRIs to make sure that nothing shows up. For our other son, Tyler, it’s come back clean every time, but for Caleb, back in his December MRI, we found out, which was the most difficult thing. Rath: Tell us about the path that led you to Massachusetts, to what could be a potentially life-saving treatment here.Shauna: In 2018, our geneticist recommended: the only way to stop this from forming was a bone marrow transplant. But for a small group of boys, there aren’t any available donors. Our geneticist recommended that we do this testing in advance to kind of have an idea, if the boys develop a cerebral form of the disease. In 2018, we had them both tested. Tyler, again on the lucky side, had 230 matches. Caleb had none.So we followed up to see what our options were. We were, at the time, following some gene therapy clinical trials that were going on, so that became a reality once we knew that Caleb would not have a match. We knew that the only option for him would be this gene therapy.Thankfully, in September of 2022, it was approved by the FDA. Following his MRI in December, we knew right away that we were going to have to go this route. Having followed the study, we knew that it was only available in Boston and Philadelphia, so that was what began our path. After that, there were several phone calls between our doctors, communicating back and forth. Then, in March, they brought us out to do another MRI to make sure the disease was progressing; every now and then, it’ll show up, and then it’ll just halt. From there, we arrived in Boston last Tuesday, and we had doctor’s appointments. On Monday, he was admitted to Boston Children’s, where they put in a tube that harvests the white blood cells that they will send for the therapy to be created. Rath: That’s amazing. And he was discharged? Shauna: We had a very successful harvest. Typically, the kids are on the machine for about six hours. He was kind of borderline in terms of whether or not they would have the cells, so they proactively said, “Let’s go for two more hours.” So he was hooked up to the machine for eight hours.Rath: It’s incredible, using his own cells to heal.Shauna: It’s pretty amazing. In 8 to 10 weeks, those cells will be ready, and they’ll send them back.Rath: Had it not been for the tragedy with his cousin, you wouldn’t have had any reason to think to test your boys. Should screening for this be more widespread? Shauna: Oh, absolutely. There is a community right now trying to get newborn screenings in every state. The earliest detection is essential for keeping this managed, for the best outcome for the kids. Lonnie: If it weren’t for us knowing, it would have been the same result for Caleb. If we found it too late, there would have been nothing that could have been done. Kids have a chance if they know what they’re up against before it takes their life away. Shauna: It’s a very risky procedure. Obviously, a gene therapy transplant like this has a lot of components. It’s the only thing available right now to stop this disease, so just being aware is absolutely essential for the best outcomes. Lonnie: And for Caleb’s specific case, the fact that this gene therapy is available is truly amazing, especially the timing of it. A coupe of years ago, we may have been able to get it done through a clinical trial, but beyond that, it really would have been limited options. You probably would have had to go through with the bone marrow, and with him not having a good match, it really wouldn’t have been a good option if therapy hadn’t been developed. Fortunately, it came just in time.",Science and Technology,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:42:59 EST",77a15c17b81471a3bcc7f714e03e9f07

5037,"State Senate passes bills on gender-neutral birth records, ID access for homeless people",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/27/state-senate-passes-bills-on-gender-neutral-birth-records-id-access-for-homeless-people,"Both bills have passed the Senate before, and now it's up to the House.","With a pair of unanimous votes on Thursday, the Massachusetts Senate approved bills that would make it easier for homeless youth and adults to access state IDs, and for Bay Staters to make sure their state identification documents accurately reflect their gender identity. A round of applause broke out in the Senate chamber after the 39-0 vote on a bill that Sen. Jo Comerford said would allow “gender representation on state documents and IDs to be as beautifully diverse as the people in our commonwealth.”Comerford’s bill would let people more easily change their gender — to male, female or a gender-neutral “X” marker — on birth certificates, and codify the Registry of Motor Vehicles’ current practice of offering “X” as a gender option on driver’s licenses, permits and other ID cards. People will no longer be required to provide medical documentation when they request such a change. The bill also directs state officials to develop a plan, including a timeline and cost estimates, for rolling out a nonbinary gender designation on all state forms and documents. “People know what gender they are. They don't need a doctor's note or the state to tell them,” said Comerford, one of three Senate members of the Legislature’s LGBTQ Caucus. “Our current binary options are archaic, limited and overly restrictive, and have created a situation where government is infringing on people's civil right to self-identify.”Before the final vote, senators adopted an amendment from Andover Sen. Barry Finegold that would also allow for gender changes and nonbinary gender markers on Massachusetts marriage certificates. Comerford, a Northampton Democrat, said an ""X"" gender designation is now available on passports, and that 16 states and Washington, D.C., allow the same designation on birth certificates. At least 22 states and D.C. currently have ""X"" a gender option on driver's licenses, she said. The second bill senators passed on Thursday directs the RMV to develop a process through which people experiencing homelessness can apply for a state ID card without paying a fee or providing address information. Sen. Robyn Kennedy’s bill would let adults and unaccompanied youth prove their Massachusetts residency by providing alternative documents, like papers from a shelter or other service provider.“Imagine for a moment that your barrier to obtaining employment, applying for housing and gaining access to health insurance was simply a matter of providing adequate identification, and that without your Massachusetts state ID, you would be unable to acquire the most basic of human needs, such as food,” said Kennedy, a Worcester Democrat. “For approximately 20,000 people living in the commonwealth, this is a reality, and obtaining state identification is the first critical step in accomplishing typical life tasks that can lift them out of homelessness.” The Senate’s votes Thursday send the pair of bills to the House for consideration. Last session, the Senate unanimously passed similar bills, and each died after the House Ways and Means Committee did not act on them.",Politics,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 16:32:32 EST",55c0d777a707ba5efc756cd7b4c7fc96
4122,Pandemic food assistance that held back hunger comes to an end,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/01/pandemic-food-assistance-that-held-back-hunger-comes-to-an-end,Millions of Americans will have less to spend on groceries as emergency food assistance that Congress enacted early in the pandemic has ended.,"Millions of Americans will have less to spend on groceries as emergency food assistance that Congress enacted early in the pandemic has ended.On average, individuals will get about $90 less this month in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Some households will see a cut of $250 a month or more, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research institute. ""This is a change that will increase hardship for many individuals and families, especially given the modest amount of regular SNAP benefits, which are only about $6 per person per day, on average,"" says Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy for the institute.More than 40 million people in the U.S. are helped out each month by SNAP. Some states had already phased out the pandemic assistance, and the remaining 32 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands issued their last emergency benefits in February.The cut in SNAP benefits comes as food prices continue to rise. Carlis Phares who is 64 and lives in Columbus, Ohio calls it a double whammy.""It's going to be a lot harder,"" Phares says.Social security is her main source of income, and while those payments include a cost of living adjustment, it hasn't kept up with the increase in rent and other expenses, Phares says. The pandemic boost in SNAP allotments helped her eat well and preserve her Social Security money for other things. Now she'll have to do more with less.""I'm going to figure out how to make it stretch,"" Phares says. One strategy to save money is to cut back on meat and fresh produce and stock up on cheaper foods, such as crackers, bread and rice, she says. But Phares knows this isn't good for her. ""The cheapest stuff is the less healthy stuff,"" Phares says. ""I learned that, because I gained a lot of weight eating on the cheaper stuff — the starches, the crackers. And now that I've gotten myself to a better weight, I'm going to have to figure that out,"" she says.Rosenbaum says the annual cost-of-living increase built into SNAP will help ""soften"" the blow from the cut in emergency allotments. In addition, a re-evaluation of benefits in 2021 aimed at making nutritious foods more affordable led to a bump in payments, which also partially offsets the cuts. Even so, in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, nearly 9.5 million older adults, ages 50 and up, were considered ""food insecure"", meaning they sometimes struggled to afford all the food they needed, according to an AARP analysis. In addition, an estimated 9 million children live in food insecure homes, according to No Kid Hungry, a nonprofit group that works to end hunger. Overall, about 10% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in 2021. ""SNAP remains our most powerful tool for combating hunger,"" Rosenbaum says. ""It's found to be linked to improved health, education and economic outcomes and to lower medical costs,"" she says.This year, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill re-authorize the farm bill, which includes a review of the SNAP program, advocates say there's an opportunity to strengthen the program, especially at a time when diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are on the rise. A recent CDC report found 1 in 2 young children in the U.S. don't eat a daily vegetable, but most consume plenty of sugary drinks. And about 1 in 5 children in the U.S. have obesity. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force recommends strengthening food and nutrition security through the farm bill, including expanding the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program that gives SNAP recipients more money to buy fruits and vegetables.This is similar to the Double Up Food Bucks program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which doubles the value of SNAP benefits when used to buy produce at farmers markets and other venues. Another idea is to strengthen standards for retailers to encourage a wider variety of nutritious foods in stores.The farm bill, which is typically re-authorized every five years, is set to expire at the end of September. It's a massive piece of legislation that governs everything from agriculture subsidies to nutrition programs, including SNAP. ""[We're] looking at the farm bill as anti-hunger legislation,"" says Eric Mitchell, executive director of the Alliance to End Hunger. Mitchell says there's lots of momentum — from a wide variety of groups, policymakers to healthcare organizations — to scale up programs that can be beneficial. Mitchell points to a couple of examples: ""Being able to use SNAP benefits at your local farmers markets, as well as creating food pharmacies where you can use your SNAP benefits to purchase healthy foods to help improve your health outcomes.""In the meantime there are still many people in need. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective, Ohio's largest food bank, has seen an increase in the need for its services even before the emergency benefits ran out.Carlis Phares says with a reduced benefit she'll have to rely on some basics from the food bank. ""I think there's going to be a whole lot of people going to the food banks,"" she says. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:01:00 EST",dd84c05b6f1cef5b0b3a9f76db44677d
1563,Mel King dies at 94,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/mel-king-dies-at-94,King was a longtime community advocate and Boston’s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election.,"Updated March 28 at 10:21 p.m.Melvin King, a longtime community advocate, state legislator, and Boston’s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election, has died at age 94.His son Michael King confirmed Mel King’s death to GBH News Tuesday evening.“He spoke truth to power, and he was pretty much beyond — above — reproach,” Michael King said. “That’s the openness and the example that he was trying to set. ‘It’s not that hard to do the right thing,’ is something that he would say.”For the past half-century, King has been one of the city’s most well-known advocates for local communities of color. In politics, his endorsement was highly sought after by candidates seeking credibility with Boston’s Black community.King was born in Boston’s South End neighborhood, which in the mid-20th century represented the heart of the city’s Black population. He graduated from what is now the John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, then-Boston Tech. King was first elected to public office in 1973 to the state Legislature representing Suffolk County. He lost to Ray Flynn in the 1983 mayoral election. That run in 1983 would end up inspiring people like Tito Jackson, who ran for the office in 2017. He said he remembers being 8 years old, seeing a large Black man — in every sense of that word — speaking the truth. He said the Mel King way of organizing a coalition, across race and income, informed his own run. “As sad of a moment as this is, it also means that Mel King lived an impactful life that touched the lives of tens of thousands — and maybe hundreds of thousands — of people,” Jackson said. State Sen. Lydia Edwards, a frequent visitor to King’s Sunday brunches, said his passing marks the end of the city’s radically loving activists.“I’m really sad because we don’t have any more Mels, not even a pipeline for Mels at all,” she said. “He was a universal uniter, above the geographic division, above class division, race — he was the one all organizers could look to and know his heart was the purest.”King endorsed Edwards during her first, unsuccessful run for state Senate in 2016.For Boston City Councilor Kendra Lara, King guided her political organizing from a young age. As a state Representative, he helped the People Before Highways movement, a movement that put a stop to government attempts to extend the I-95 through Roxbury. Residents’ fierce pushback put 2,000 protesters on the street in 1969, which halted the development and ultimately led to the Orange Line being brought into those neighborhoods instead. “When I learned that story — when I was in the sixth grade — is when I realized that people who looked like me and the people in my neighborhood had power. That if we could stop a 10-lane highway from cutting through our neighborhood, that there was absolutely nothing that we couldn’t do,” said Lara, who now represents Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury. “And Mel King is a part of that legacy.“When I think about my community, it exists in the way it does because of him,” she continued. “And when I think about my generation of organizers — and when I think about the generation of Black and brown young people who grew up in movements, who grew up fighting to make sure that their community had a voice and power in what our neighborhoods looked like — it is because people like Mel King set the standard.”“For decades, Mel King taught us all how to serve, how to build, and how to love,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement Tuesday night. “On behalf of the City of Boston, we send our deepest condolences to the King family and the many, many loved ones, mentees, and friends of Mel. With gratitude and determination to keep fighting, Rest in Power.”“Mel King is an iconic figure for Boston, not just in the Black community, but Boston overall because he knew how to bring people together,” said Bishop William E. Dickerson II, a friend of King’s. “I know that his impact is going to be missed deeply by so many people, so many sectors, of our communities.” Michael King, one of King’s six children, is the director of the South End Technology Center, which the elder King founded in 1997. He says his father was part of the solution that helped pave the way to make Boston's leadership more diverse.“You know, he was part of the solution to get us to be able to accept that any person who has done their homework and does their homework can reach any point in life,” he said. King said he wanted to honor his father and rejoice in his life.“I don’t think there’s anything to be sad about. We miss him, but that’s the selfish part of us, you know?” said Michael King. “I feel like I was blessed to be, you know — have a chance to, you know — be in this time, next to someone who took his journey so seriously.” This story has been updated to include additional comments and information.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 20:56:40 EST",abd0cad63eee6071b83fb12fbd183666
6471,‘We don’t know where to go’: Homeless encampment cleared as city cracks down on tents at Mass. and Cass,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/02/we-dont-know-where-to-go-homeless-encampment-cleared-as-city-cracks-down-on-tents-at-mass-and-cass,People living in the area say many of Boston officials' concerns could be prevented with better sanitation.,"In recent weeks, people living in encampments near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard fell into a daily routine — tents, tarps and makeshift shelters were cleared away for street cleaning, reconstructed after sunset and turned over again the next day. As of Monday, city officials brought an end to the cycle: Tents and other encampments will no longer be allowed in the area, a Boston intersection marked for years by a concentration of homelessness, substance use and poverty.Workers employed by the city and the neighborhood's business improvement district helped people clear their tents and pack up belongings, dragging broken tents, mattresses and wood pallets into a nearby dumpster. The city says the clearing marks the end of a period of leniency offered during the winter months, in response to rising issues with crime and sanitation within the tents. But many displaced people living in the area say they don't know where else to go.Workers employed by the neighborhood’s business improvement association helped break down a tent belonging to an unhoused woman who identified herself as Alex, who protested the clearing while pulling tent poles from her former home.“You don’t have to leave, you just can’t bring back a tent,” a worker in a yellow vest said. “There was supposed to be housing,” Alex said, breaking down her tent from the inside. “Now we’re just going to be sleeping in the rain.” The trash, needles, garbage and human waste that accumulate in the streets along Mass. and Cass could be prevented with better sanitation, Alex says. “They have better ways to help us keep clean, like more trash barrels and public bathrooms,” she told GBH News. “There’s trash everywhere because they don’t want to provide what we need, and now they want us to just take down our tents and figure out a way to survive.” Alex interrupted her thought to run over to a man overdosing on the sidewalk. She offered nasal naloxone — a medication used to reverse opioid overdose — from her backpack as multiple Boston police officers, Boston Public Health Commission workers and an emergency harm reduction worker from Boston Healthcare for the Homeless rushed in to bring the man back to consciousness. “He’ll be OK,” Alex said, unphased as she continued her thought. “Basically, homeless people are being made to suffer because the police want to make arrests. Those who have warrants will probably clear the area, and the rest of us will just sleep out in the rain.” Among those who dismantled their encampments Monday was Tara, a woman in her mid-thirties who has lived on Mass. and Cass for the past year. “I don’t think we’re going to be gone for long,” Tara said as she shoved a blanket, a book and two shampoo bottles into a milk crate near her tent. “It’s disgusting how much money is wasted doing this, but think of how much money they look to lose having us gone? I mean, people are employed because we’re here.""Enforcing the zero-tolerance encampment protocol is a return to a policy implemented by Mayor Michelle Wu back in January 2022, following a city-sanctioned sweep of more than 200 tents in the area. Nearly 600 people have passed through six new temporary housing sites since that sweep, according to city data, and 110 people have been placed in permanent housing. Unhoused individuals who were asked to remove their encampments Monday were offered “free shelter, substance use treatment, relocation and storage options,” according to a statement from a Wu spokesperson, while “an enhanced case management team is connecting with every individual in the area and developing individualized service plans.” The city also launched a new protocol for people hoping to connect with their lost or missing loved ones in the area by locating friends or family members, obtaining consent and facilitating communication. Returning home is not an option for John, who says he has lived near Mass. and Cass for roughly two years and struggled to find a better housing option. John’s immediate plan is to find a bed in a shelter, though waitlists for services remain long. “It seems like some people benefitted for certain reasons and others didn’t,” he said. “I don’t really know why.” Some longtime occupants of the encampments are still struggling to find resources. Among them, Mercedes says she has been living in the area for nearly four years and remains on a waitlist for transitional housing.“I see new people coming here all the time, and some get help, but people that have been out here longer than me still aren’t getting help,” Mercedes said. “It doesn’t make any sense. We don't know where to go.” Newmarket Business Association Executive Director Sue Sullivan, who runs a program to employ people struggling with homelessness or substance use at Mass. and Cass, moved from tent to tent Monday with her team of employees in yellow vests to clear the street, moving garbage into trash bins and taking down tents. “Most of our guys were living in these tents a year and a half ago,” Sullivan said, “and now it’s taking us forever to get them to better places.” New people arrive in the area on a regular basis, Sullivan said, seeking treatment at methadone clinics or detox programs in the area. “There are no less than 30 people out here every day helping people get into housing, as much as housing is available,” she said. But when it comes to building new housing, she said nobody seems to want facilities in their own neighborhoods.“No one wants transitional housing or treatment centers anywhere, and yet all these people are waiting for that. Every day, someone asks me why there isn’t more housing,” Sullivan said. “I’m not a housing person, but I share that frustration. I don’t know the answer, but I know there’s got to be a way.” The city “promised housing, but they don’t have any money for it,” said Laquan, who packed up the tent he shares with his partner Sophie. The couple might spend their nights in a shelter, or “another street corner in a tent somewhere else in the city,” he said, packing his clothes and blankets into four plastic bins provided by the city, with the guarantee of 90 days of safekeeping. “They have the money to store my stuff, just not me,” Laquan said. “They don’t want to put me in a house or an apartment, because it takes months, years, decades … but wherever they put me, that’s where I reside. That’s my home.”",Local,"Tue, 02 May 2023 11:26:43 EST",7421ce9cd083b68f8e9ee43a1b955183
5323,Days (and nights) of Punk: Michael Grecco's photos show Boston's '70s and '80s punk scene,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/15/days-and-nights-of-punk-michael-greccos-photos-show-bostons-70s-and-80s-punk-scene,Some never-before-scene photos are now on exhibition in the South End.,"Boston’s punk scene in the late 1970s and early '80s was marked by transformation. “Boston went from being sort of a hippie, free love, granola folk rock kind of town to the emergence of Reagan, Reaganomics,” photographer Michael Grecco told GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel. “There was sort of a feeling of impending dread in a lot of society. And I think that this punk scene, it was a total rebellion.”Grecco, who worked for the Associated Press at the Massachusetts State House during the day, would ditch his khakis and button-up shirts at night for tight jeans, ripped-up T-shirts and leather jackets. He’d grab his camera and go to see a show. Now his photos, some of which have never been seen before, are on display at the Anderson Yezerski Gallery in the South End as part of an exhibit called Days of Punk. His photos include members of local bands, like Human Sexual Response and Mission of Burma. They also captured The Clash, Devo and Billy Idol. “Boston was the first city in every tour in the United States of every band that came through,” Grecco said. “Every band came through here. There was something you can do every single night of the week. And I never stayed home.”Grecco’s archivist, Mykle Parker, suggested unearthing some of the photos for the new exhibition. “The stuff sat in my files. I kind of ignored it. I didn't use it for my portfolio,” Grecco said. “And then my archivist started pulling stuff out. She's like, 'You've got to do something with this.'”Grecco grew up in suburban New York “as a very sort of mothered, overly protected kid.”He started taking trains into New York City as a teenager to see live music, especially jazz. When he moved to Boston, he wandered into The Rathskeller — Kenmore Square’s legendary punk club, open from 1974 to 1997 — “and was just, like, absolutely blown away by this scene.”The music industry was at a pivotal moment, Grecco said. “It's the rebellion that changed our entire music system,” he said. “You had punk on one side changing FM radio, especially the album-oriented rock stations out there. And then you had rap on the other side, blowing up things like Motown and these very slick, produced bands and music that didn't seem authentic.” The punk scene was neither slick nor heavily produced, Grecco said. Tickets were usually around $5, and people like Grecco who were part of the music scene sometimes got in for free because they knew the bouncers. “It was also a time where we had unfettered access and you would have things like, you know, Lux Interior of The Cramps performing at The Channel and his pants fall off and he performs the second half of the set naked,” Grecco said. “Then you go backstage to photograph Lux, and he puts his private part in a hot dog bun to do his portrait. I mean, that just wouldn't happen today.”",Local,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 13:29:07 EST",9d1cb725ad89d24e36b99f3ccbf331d7

Most notably, the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the Special Counsel found that Rollins tried to influence the election in which voters were choosing her successor as Suffolk County District Attorney. According to federal investigators, Rollins fed the press damaging details about one candidate, then-acting DA Kevin Hayden, including sensitive DOJ information; acted as a political adviser to the other candidate, Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo; and lied under oath about what she'd done. Rollins' resignation seems to rule out any additional penalties from the government. But possible consequences for her political allies, and to others who share her progressive approach to law enforcement, are just beginning to come into focus. Adam Reilly is joined by GBH News Senior Investigative Reporter Phillip Martin and Abdallah Fayyad, an opinion writer and editorial board member at the Boston Globe, to discuss the long-term implications of the Rollins scandal.Will the Rollins scandal damage her allies moving forward?

1376,Housing industry in Massachusetts one of many to be impacted by Silicon Valley Bank fiasco,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/13/housing-industry-in-massachusetts-one-of-many-to-be-impacted-by-silicon-valley-bank-fiasco,Its collapse could create problems for affordable housing developers.,"The seizure of Silicon Valley Bank is having large ripple effects across Massachusetts, in markets as diverse as tech, finance and even affordable housing. Silicon Valley Bank imploded on Friday when federal regulators announced their takeover of the institution. The second-largest bank failure in U.S. history was triggered by its disclosure last week that SVB had growing losses on government bonds because of rising interest rates. That’s when many clients began withdrawing their funds, causing it all to capsize. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, said customers will have access to their funds on Monday. Silicon Valley Bank did not return requests for comment. “It’s a seismic event in our financial system and our banking system,” said Cornelius Hurley, a banking law professor at Boston University. On Sunday, New York state regulators also announced they were shuttering the New York-based Signature Bank, with the FDIC taking control of the company, too. Some startups can lean into the bailout from the federal government, but relief might be more complicated for the housing industry. The big reason for this is Silicon Valley Bank’s $900 million acquisition of Boston Private Bank, a trust and banking provider that long had a major presence in the region. SVB’s website says that is has loaned and invested more than $2 billion in affordable housing projects nationwide since 2002. Beyond immediate concerns of payroll, some worry that it will make funding more difficult for current projects in the region. “It was a very strong community lender involved in a lot of affordable housing deals,” said Marc Draisen, head of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. He estimates the number of nonprofit developers in the area that relied on SVB for loans to be in the “double digits.” He said that with real estate deals, developers generally have to deposit their money in the bank as well, not just take the loans. “A lot of affordable housing lenders have deposits,” Draisen said. ”In some cases, it can also include construction loans — which, of course, could be one of the most serious parts of this situation, because those developers may have to go out and get another construction loan if the cash will no longer be forthcoming from Silicon Valley Bank.” Developers could hit a barrier when they find much higher interest rates at those other banks, and lose funds.More immediately, there are concerns about how to pay contractors.Draisen said this is all a reminder of why diversifying financing is important. “It’s a reminder that we need lots of banks to be involved in financing affordable housing, not just a small handful,” he said.In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu’s administration created a survey to gauge impact from area entrepreneurs and businesses. “This is a deeply distressing moment for many business leaders, entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and workers in our community, and they will not be left to fend for themselves,” the mayor said in a statement. “In partnership with the Commonwealth, our immediate focus is helping our businesses make payroll and provide for their employees. We appreciate the local banks stepping up quickly to serve these companies and support their workers.”Wu said in a press gaggle that so far a “small number” of affordable housing developments considered SVB for construction loans, with seven identified so far. The mayor said she doesn’t believe those who got mortgage products from SVB will have any risk of their funding being jeopardized, but “we are working to get in touch with everyone individually and make sure we can be a support as well.”The FDIC said that customers who had up to $250,000 per account deposited with SVB would have access to their funds, but people with an excess of that have to call individually. Many developers borrow over $250,000. The impacts on existing affordable housing projects could be wide ranging. While the FDIC only commented on deposits, Silicon Valley Bank was involved in a multitude of obligations beyond that, to developers. “There's projects at different points in the process, right? So one would expect it would be different in each one of those points in the process. But the point is, it's much more than just deposits that the bank was involved in,” said Kevin Murray, interim executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations. He said the organization had a meeting this morning to discuss the impacts with local community development corporations. “One woman who came to the meeting today was very concerned because they just last week finished the first-time homebuyer course and SVB was one of the main participants on the banking side,” Murray recalled. “So what happens to all those people who've been through this whole process? What does it mean to become a first-time homebuyer and suddenly the main partner in this process is gone?”A number of nonprofits are being impacted by the SVB’s collapse as well, according to Jim Klocke, CEO of the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network, for the same reason: being holdover clients of Boston Private Bank. Some of the uncertainty was rectified when the federal government announced they were going to make depositors at SVB whole, said Klocke. But the whole situation is putting donors on edge. “Frankly, the news that the bank was in trouble, the news that the bank was being closed then in and of itself creates tremendous uncertainty among employees who wonder about their next paycheck, among vendors who wonder about their next payments, and among nonprofits who have been planning to receive donations from people who might now be more reluctant to make donations because their bank just went under,” he said. For venture capital fund firms, it was about finding fast solutions to an unpredictable situation. Adrian Mendoza, general partner of Mendoza Ventures, a Boston-based venture capital fund, said he was up past midnight helping clients who have accounts with SVB.“Over the weekend we saw both funds and businesses unable to run payroll at all,” he said. “We reached out to our entrepreneurs. We had minimal exposure, anyone who had just a little bit — we reached out to our other banking partners and they quickly spun up, over the weekend, bank accounts.”Hurley, the Boston University professor, questions whether the federal government is raising the deposit insurance ceiling “to the sky” and said that hasn’t been answered yet. He anticipates that there will be broader repercussions to taxpayers. “When banks have to pay higher premiums to the FDIC, they’re going to take that out on somebody. They’re going to take it out on their customers, either in the form of higher fees or lower deposit rates or higher credit rates on loans. So there’s a tremendous impact on the taxpayers,” he said. Gov. Maura Healey sent a statement to reporters on Sunday, saying that her office is “closely monitoring” the situation, and has been in contract with federal regulators about impact. “Our administration is actively working to support individuals and businesses affected by SVB’s closure and to find solutions to help them address immediate needs, including putting supports in place to ensure that small businesses and employees do not experience significant disruptions,” Healey wrote.

1894,"When lawyers sleep on the job, defendants face an uphill climb to justice",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/07/when-lawyers-sleep-on-the-job-defendants-face-an-uphill-climb-to-justice,A case before the state's highest court could address that.,"Sixty years ago, the Supreme Court recognized that criminal defendants have a right to counsel at trial, which means that if they're too poor to pay for an attorney, the government will assign one. Nowadays, defendants have a right not only to a lawyer, but to an effective lawyer. But judges have struggled with how to draw the line between effective and ineffective, and this has huge implications: If a judge finds that defense counsel is ineffective, it can lead to a new trial. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to talk about a case that could change how that's done in Massachusetts. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: This is something that I think a lot of people know a little bit about, and not that many people know a lot about. I might be dating myself a little bit here, but I did not even know that the right to counsel came just 60 years ago. It's something I'm familiar with because of TV shows where police tell you 'you have the right to remain silent' and that you have the right to an attorney. But it's definitely less-known that you have a right to an effective attorney. You don't hear police officers in TV shows saying that to people when they're arrested. How exactly does this work? Daniel Medwed: As you mentioned at the top, a series of Supreme Court cases have carved out a federal constitutional right to an effective attorney at the pretrial and trial stages of your case, which means that if you can prove that your lawyer was ineffective, you can get a new trial. The problem is the Supreme Court has created a very, very high bar for proving that your lawyer was ineffective. The test comes from a rather well-known 1984 case called Strickland v. Washington, which set up a two-part standard. First, as a defendant who lost a trial, you have to prove on appeal that your trial lawyer was defective, was deficient: they failed to investigate the case, they didn't put on an alibi witness, they didn't cross-examine their opponents, things like that. And then second, you have to show that the deficiency somehow contributed to the bad verdict, to the conviction. In other words, it's not enough to show that your lawyer messed up. You have to show that that error was somehow outcome-determinative. Siegel: I think for people trying to make sense of this, in a way, it makes sense that you want to make it a thorough process to prove that someone's ineffective, because you don't want people abusing it and appealing every case on this. But the second part of that kind of stuck out to me: That you don't just have to prove that your lawyer is ineffective, but you essentially have to prove that their horrible work as your attorney is what led to conviction at trial. Medwed: Exactly. It's a little bit like the no harm, no foul concept in sports. You actually have to show that there was an impact on the ultimate decision because of the error. And this can lead to some absurd outcomes. I saw one study that found that 97% of the time when a defendant raises one of these ineffectiveness issues on appeal, they lose. And cases where lawyers were drunk or under the influence of drugs have been upheld, or at least not considered ineffective performance of counsel. One despicable case from Texas, I think, is really illustrative: A man is charged with murder and he's facing the death penalty. He's too poor to pay for a lawyer, so he's assigned one by the court. That lawyer falls asleep intermittently throughout the trial. The defendant goes to the judge to alert the judge about this, and here's the judge's response: the Constitution says you're entitled to an attorney. It says nothing about that attorney being awake. Siegel: That's just shocking to hear that. Daniel, tell us about the situation here in Massachusetts. Do we have to follow the Supreme Court case law or could we, say, provide more protection to criminal defendants in these situations? Medwed: Well, here in Massachusetts, we could create a more robust ineffectiveness doctrine than the Supreme Court demands. And here's why: it's often said that the federal Constitution is a floor. States can't provide fewer rights, less protection, than the Supreme Court and the federal Constitution require. But there's no ceiling. We can always provide more. So that's one reason among many why we still have a robust right for people to terminate pregnancies if they so choose, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has eviscerated the federal constitutional right to choice in the Dobbs case from last year. So we could create a more robust right if we wanted. Siegel: I mentioned earlier that there is a case pending in Massachusetts that could affect how these types of ineffective lawyering claims end up being treated. What exactly is at stake here? Medwed: So tomorrow, the SJC is going to hear oral arguments in a case involving a defendant named Nyasani Watt. The facts are pretty procedurally complicated, but here's the main gist: Watt was charged with first degree murder for participating in the shooting death of a young man in Dorchester back in 2011. Watt was only 17 at the time. The case went to trial a few years later, he was convicted, sentenced to life behind bars, and then he lost his appeal. Fast-forward another few years: He accumulated some evidence that his lawyer had fallen asleep off and on at trial. And he even got affidavits from a bunch of courtroom observers, folks who were in the courtroom at the time of the trial, including several prosecutors, to verify that the lawyer fell asleep. So Watt assembled all this information and filed a post-appeal motion with the original trial judge. But the trial judge said there wasn't enough information that the lawyer fell asleep at critical parts of the trial or for a substantial portion of the trial. So at least in theory, this case could provide an opportunity for the court to really evaluate whether we tolerate sleeping lawyers in criminal cases in Massachusetts. Siegel: So what do you think will end up happening here? Medwed: You know, I'm not so sure. On the one hand, there are lots of issues in this case, and it's possible the SJC will hang its hat on another issue and bypass that substantive issue altogether. For instance, there's a question about whether why Watt waited too long to file this claim, whether he should have acted earlier in the process, or whether the fact that he was really young at the time of his trial and appeal should excuse that failure to raise it before. On the other hand, if the court is inclined to take another look at the substantive doctrine here, it could provide a chance to create greater protections for criminal defendants in Massachusetts than the federal Constitution demands.",Local,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 10:03:02 EST",adbce125f2d59875b6854db13d753888

""These new forms of medical debt can create financial ruin for individuals who get sick.""Nationwide, about 100 million people — including 41% of adults — have some kind of health care debt, KFF Health News found in an investigation conducted with NPR to explore the scale and impact of the nation's medical debt crisis.The vast scope of the problem is feeding a multibillion-dollar patient financing business, with private equity and big banks looking to cash in when patients and their families can't pay for care, KFF Health News and NPR found. In the patient financing industry, profit margins top 29%, according to research firm IBISWorld, or seven times what is considered a solid hospital profit margin.Millions of patients sign up for credit cards, such as CareCredit offered by Synchrony Bank. These cards are often marketed in the waiting rooms of physicians' and dentists' offices to help people with their bills.The cards typically offer a promotional period during which patients pay no interest, but if patients miss a payment or can't pay off the loan during the promotional period, they can face interest rates that reach as high as 27%, according to the CFPB.Patients are also increasingly being routed by hospitals and other providers into loans administered by financing companies such as AccessOne. These loans, which often replace no-interest installment plans that hospitals once commonly offered, can add hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest to the debts patients owe.A KFF Health News analysis of public records from UNC Health, North Carolina's public university medical system, found that after AccessOne began administering payment plans for the system's patients, the share paying interest on their bills jumped from 9% to 46%.Hospital and finance industry officials insist they take care to educate patients about the risks of taking out loans with interest rates.But federal regulators have found that many patients remain confused about the terms of the loans. In 2013, the CFPB ordered CareCredit to create a $34.1 million reimbursement fund for consumers the agency said had been victims of ""deceptive credit card enrollment tactics.""The new CFPB report does not recommend new sanctions against lenders. Regulators cautioned, however, that the system still traps many patients in damaging financing arrangements. ""Patients appear not to fully understand the terms of the products and sometimes end up with credit they are unable to afford,"" the agency said.The risks are particularly high for lower-income borrowers and those with poor credit.Regulators found, for example, that about a quarter of people with a low credit score who signed up for a deferred-interest medical loan were unable to pay it off before interest rates jumped. By contrast, just 10% of borrowers with excellent credit failed to avoid the high interest rates.The CFPB warned that the growth of patient financing products poses yet another risk to low-income patients, saying they should be offered financial assistance with large medical bills but instead are being routed into credit cards or loans that pile interest on top of medical bills they can't afford.""Consumer complaints to the CFPB suggest that, rather than benefiting consumers, as claimed by the companies offering these products, these products in fact may cause confusion and hardship,"" the report concluded. ""Many people would be better off without these products.""KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

458,Gov. Healey unveils $742 million tax relief plan,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/27/gov-healey-unveils-742-million-tax-relief-plan,"Healey’s tax bill has breaks for families, renters and seniors.","Gov. Maura Healey is proposing a $742 million package of tax cuts in the state budget she will file Wednesday, offering relief for parents, renters and seniors alongside other tax reforms. Healey's plan shares common ground with the tax proposal former Gov. Charlie Baker could not get over the finish line his final year in office, and it features some other measures that have been kicking around Beacon Hill for years, like a new live theater tax credit and changes to the way locally produced hard cider is taxed. Announced Monday morning at the Demakes Family YMCA in Lynn, the tax package is centered around a child and family tax credit that Healey touted on the campaign trail. Healey's office said 700,000 taxpayers would benefit from the $600 per-dependent credit, helping them keep up with climbing costs for child and senior care. The child and family tax credit, for children under 13, people with disabilities and senior dependents age 65 and up, combines two interrelated existing benefits — the Household Dependent Tax Credit and Dependent Care Tax Credit — while removing the cap on dependents, and increasing the benefits. At a cost to the state of $458 million for the next budget year, it's the single largest piece of Healey's proposal. Healey said she and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll are filing this package for people ""who are struggling to get by as the cost of living continues to skyrocket past them – the family watching their grocery bill grow each week, the young mom who wants to return to her dream job but can’t afford child care, the recent college graduate who can’t afford both his rent and student loan payments, the seniors who want to keep the home where they raised their family.""Along with the child and family credit, the plan would increase the rental deduction from $3,000 to $4,000, and double to $2,400 a credit for low-income seniors paying property taxes or rent. In a pair of moves Healey described as ways to make Massachusetts more competitive with other states, the bill would use credits to eliminate the estate tax — which currently kicks in at $1 million — for estates valued up to $3 million, and cut the tax rate on short-term capital gains to 5% from 12%Last year, Baker filed a nearly $700 million tax plan that also would have boosted credits for dependent and child care, increased the rental deduction, doubled credits for seniors, reformed the estate tax and cut the short-term capital gains tax. The House and Senate each passed different tax relief bills last year, never agreeing on specifics. Ultimately, legislative leaders shelved the bills after realizing the state would be returning $3 billion in excess revenues to residents, pledging to revisit the issue this year. Senate President Karen Spilka, at the start of the session in January, called for lawmakers to pass progressive tax relief “soon.” Tax policy bills, though, must start in the House, where Speaker Ron Mariano has talked about watching the state’s fiscal picture before acting. Healey’s tax package would also: expand the list of occupations that qualify for apprenticeship tax credits, and double the statewide cap on those credits to $5 million;increase the cap on Housing Development Incentive Program credits, with the goal of producing more market-rate housing in gateway cities;increase the cap to $8 million for the state's dairy tax credit, which Massachusetts Dairy Farmers Association President David Shepard said would ""greatly help offset the forecasted difficult times ahead in dairy costs of production and pricing"";exempt employer assistance with student loan repayment from taxable income;expand tax-deductible commuter transit benefits to include regional transit passes and bike commuter expenses;double the credit for lead paint abatement, and double the maximum credit for septic tank repair or replacement in a primary residence, and;extend the expiring brownfields tax credit for cleanup of contaminated properties through 2028.",Politics,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 09:30:46 EST",72f6265e910dba08031d11a15ddfb268
1243,A roadblock to life-saving addiction treatment is gone. Now what?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/06/a-roadblock-to-life-saving-addiction-treatment-is-gone-now-what,"For two decades — as opioid overdose deaths rose steadily — the federal government limited access to buprenorphine, a medication that addiction experts consider the gold-standard for treating patients with an opioid use disorder. Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.","For two decades — as opioid overdose deaths rose steadily — the federal government limited access to buprenorphine, a medication that addiction experts consider the gold-standard for treating patients with an opioid use disorder. Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.Clinicians who wanted to prescribe the medicine had to complete an 8-hour training. They could only treat a limited number of patients and had to keep special records. They were given a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number starting with X, a designation that many doctors say made them a target for drug enforcement audits.""Just the process associated with taking care of our patients with a substance use disorder made us feel like, 'boy, this is dangerous stuff,'"" says Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, who chairs the American Medical Association's task force on substance use disorder.""The science doesn't support that but the rigamarole suggested that.""That rigamarole is mostly gone. Congress eliminated what became known as the ""X-waiver"" in legislation President Biden signed late last year. Now begins what some addiction experts are calling a truth serum moment.Was the X-waiver and the burdens that came with it the real reason only about 7% of clinicians in the U.S. were cleared to prescribe buprenorphine? Or was it an excuse that masked hesitation about treating addiction, if not outright disdain for these patients?There's great optimism among some leaders that getting rid of the X-waiver will expand access to buprenorphine and reduce overdoses. One study from 2021 shows taking buprenorphine reduces the risk by 50%. The medication is an opioid that produces much weaker effects than heroin or fentanyl and reduces cravings for those deadlier drugs.The nation's drug czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, says getting rid of the X-waiver will ultimately prevent millions of deaths.""The impact of this will be felt for years to come,"" Gupta says. ""It is a true historic change that, frankly, I could only dream of being possible.""Gupta and others envision obstetricians prescribing buprenorphine to their pregnant patients, infectious disease doctors adding it to their medical tool box, and lots more patients starting buprenorphine when they come to emergency rooms, primary care clinics and rehabilitation facilities.We are ""transforming the way we think to make every moment an opportunity to start this treatment and save someone's life,"" says Dr. Sarah Wakeman, the medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston.Wakeman says clinicians who she's been reaching out to for the past decade are finally willing to consider treating patients with buprenorphine. Still, she knows stigma and discrimination could undermine efforts to help those who aren't being served. In 2021, a national survey showed just 22% of people with an opioid use disorder received buprenorphine or methadone, which is another form of medication-assisted treatment.The truth serum experimentThe truth serum experiment – what will test whether clinicians will now step up prescribing – is underway in hospitals and clinics across the country as patients struggling with addiction queue up for treatment.One woman named Kim, 65, is among them.Kim's recent visit to the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center in southern Massachusetts began in an exam room with Jamie Simmons, a registered nurse who runs the center's addiction treatment program but doesn't have prescribing powers. NPR agreed to use only Kim's first name to limit discrimination linked to her drug use.Kim tells Simmons that buprenorphine has helped her stay off heroin and avoid an overdose for nearly 20 years. Kim takes a brand of the medication called Suboxone, which comes in the form of thin film-like strips she dissolves under her tongue.""It's the best thing they could have ever come out with,"" Kim says, ""I don't think I ever even had a desire to use heroin since I've been taking them.""Buprenorphine can produce mild euphoria and slow breathing but there's a ceiling on the effects. Patients like Kim may develop a tolerance and not experience any effects.""I don't get high on Suboxones,"" Kim says, ""they just keep me normal.""Still many clinicians have been hesitant to use buprenorphine – known as a partial opioid agonist – to treat an addiction to more deadly forms of the drug.Kim's primary care doctor at the health center never applied for an X-waiver. So for years Kim has bounced from one treatment program to another, seeking a prescription. When there were lapses in her access to buprenorphine, the cravings returned – an especially scary prospect now that the powerful opioid fentanyl has replaced heroin on the streets of Massachusetts, where Kim lives.""I've seen so many people fall out [overdose] in the last month,"" says Kim, her eyes wide, ""that stuff is so strong that within a couple minutes, boom.""Because fentanyl can kill so quickly, the benefits of taking buprenorphine and other medications to treat an opioid use disorder have increased as deaths linked to even stronger types of fentanyl rise. Buprenorphine is present in a small percentage of overdose deaths nationwide, 2.6% – virtually always with a mix of other drugs, often benzodiazepines. Fentanyl is in 94% of overdose deaths in Massachusetts.""Bottom line is, fentanyl kills people, buprenorphine doesn't,"" Simmons says.That reality adds urgency to Kim's health center visit because Kim took her last Suboxone before arriving. Her latest prescription has run out. Cravings for heroin could resume tomorrow if she doesn't get more Suboxone. Simmons confirms the dose and tells Kim that her primary care doctor may be willing to renew the prescription now that the X-waiver is not required. But Dr. Than Win has some concerns after reviewing Kim's most recent urine test.It showed traces of cocaine, fentanyl, marijuana and Xanax, and Win says she's worried about how the street drugs might interact with buprenorphine.""I don't want my patients to die from an overdose,"" Win says. ""But I'm not comfortable with the fentanyl and a lot of narcotics in the system.""Kim is adamant that she's not intentionally ingesting fentanyl. It might have been in the cocaine she says her roommate shares occasionally. Kim says she takes the Xanax to sleep. Her drug use presents complications that many primary care doctors don't have experience managing. Some clinicians are apprehensive about using an opioid to treat an addiction to opioids, despite compelling evidence that it saves patients' lives.Win is worried about writing her first prescription for Suboxone. But she agrees to help Kim stay on the medication.""I wanted to start with someone a little bit easier,"" Win says. ""It's hard for me, that's the reality and truth.""About half of the providers at the health center had an X-waiver when it was still required. Simmons says some of the resistance to having the waiver was rooted in stigma or misunderstanding about addiction. She urges doctors to treat addiction as they would any other disease.""You wouldn't not treat a diabetic, you wouldn't not treat a patient who is hypertensive,"" Simmons says. ""People can't control that they formed an addiction to an opiate, alcohol or a benzo.""Searching for solutions to soften stigmaAlthough the restrictions on buprenorphine prescribing are no longer in place, Dr. Mukkamala says the perception created by the X-waiver lingers.""That legacy of elevating this to a level of scrutiny and caution, that needs to be sort of walked back,"" says Mukkamala with the AMA. ""That's going to come from education.""Mukkamala sees promise in the next generation of doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants coming out of schools that have added addiction training. The AMA and the American Society of Addiction Medicine have online resources for clinicians who want to learn on their own.Some of these resources may help fulfill a new training requirement for clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine and other controlled narcotics. It will take effect in June. The DEA has not issued details about that training.But training alone may not shift behavior: take the experience of Rhode Island.The number of doctors approved to prescribe buprenorphine jumped more than 200% from 2016 to 2022 after the state said physician training should include an X-waiver. Still, having the option to prescribe buprenorphine ""didn't open the floodgates"" for patients in need of treatment, says Dr. Jody Rich, an addiction specialist who teaches at Brown University. The number of patients taking buprenorphine in Rhode Island increased – from 2016 to 2022 when the number of qualified prescribers jumped – but at a much slower rate .""It all comes back to stigma,"" Rich says.He says longstanding resistance among some providers to treating addiction is shifting as younger people enter medicine. But the opioid crisis can't wait for a generational change, he says. To expand buprenorphine access now, Rich's research shows states could use pharmacists, partnered with doctors, to help manage the care of more patients with an opioid use disorder.Wakeman, at Mass General Brigham, says it might be time to hold clinicians who don't provide addiction care accountable through quality measures tied to payments.""We're expected to care for patients with diabetes or to care for patients with heart attack in a certain way and the same should be true for patients with an opioid use disorder,"" says Wakeman.One quality measure could be to track how often prescribers start and continue buprenorphine treatment. Wakeman says it would also help if insurers reimbursed clinics for the cost of staff who aren't traditional clinicians but are critical in addiction care, like recovery coaches and case managers.Will ending the X-waiver close racial gaps?Wakeman and others are paying especially close attention to whether eliminating the X-waiver helps narrow racial gaps in buprenorphine treatment.The medication is much more commonly prescribed to white patients with private insurance or who can pay cash. But there are also stark differences by race at some health centers where most patients are on Medicaid and would seem to have equal access to this addiction treatment.At the New Bedford health center, Black patients represent 15% of all patients but only 6% of those taking buprenorphine. For Hispanics that comparison is 30% to 23%. Most of the health center patients prescribed buprenorphine are white, 61%, while they are just 36% of patients overall.Dr. Helena Hansen, who co-authored a book on race in the opioid epidemic, says access to buprenorphine doesn't guarantee that patients will benefit from it.""People are not able to stay on a life-saving medication unless the immense instability in housing, employment, social supports — the very fabric of their communities — is addressed,"" says Hansen. ""That's where we fall incredibly short in the United States.""Hansen says expanding access to buprenorphine has helped reduce overdose deaths dramatically among all drug users in France, including those who are low-income and immigrants. There, patients with an opioid use disorder are seen in their communities and offered a wide range of social services.""Removing the X-waiver,"" says Hansen, ""is not in itself going to revolutionize the opioid overdose crisis in our country. We would need to do much more.""This story is from of NPR's partnership with WBUR and KHN. KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

He broke racial barriers and balanced his activism with his artistry in ways that made people around the world listen. Belafonte, who was an EGOT holder for his Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, died at his home in New York, his publicist announced.Style, class and charisma: That was Harry Belafonte as a performer. In the 1950s, his recordings for RCA Victor, which included his iconic version of the Jamaican folk song ""Day O"" (also known as ""The Banana Boat Song"") set off a craze for calypso music. With his good looks and his shirt unbuttoned to his chest, audiences — Black and white — adored Belafonte at a time when most of America was still segregated.Belafonte was born in Harlem. His parents were from the Caribbean; his mother was Jamaican, and his father was from the island of Martinique. His mother, who was a cleaning lady, took him back to her native Jamaica, where he absorbed the island's culture.The singer told NPR in 2011 that his recording of ""The Banana Boat Song"" was inspired by the vendors he heard singing in the streets.""The song is a work song,"" he said. ""It's about men who sweat all day long, and they are underpaid. They're begging for the tallyman to come and give them an honest count: 'Count the bananas that I've picked so I can be paid.' When people sing in delight and dance and love it, they don't really understand unless they study the song — that they're singing a work song that's a song of rebellion.""And that song of rebellion was a smash. The album Calypso was a best seller, holding a spot at the top of Billboard's then newly-created album charts for several weeks in 1956.Years earlier, Harry Belafonte dropped out of high school and joined the Navy. After serving in World War II, he was working as a janitor's assistant, when someone gave him tickets to a performance at the American Negro Theatre. He was riveted.He started training there, alongside Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee. He also started singing in clubs. Pretty soon, he had a recording contract.In 1954, he won a Tony Award for a revue called ""John Murray Anderson's Almanac: A Musical Harlequinade."" He starred in movies and appeared on TV variety shows. In 1959, he was given a one-hour show on CBS. Called ""The Revlon Revue: Tonight With Belafonte,"" the program had dance numbers, folk songs, and both Black and white performers. The program won an Emmy Award — the first for an African-American. Revlon asked him for more shows. According to Belafonte, CBS stations in the south complained about its integrated cast. In interviews, he said he was asked to make it all-Black. He says he refused, and left the show.Belafonte was one of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 's most trusted friends. In 1963, he helped organize the Freedom March on Washington, where King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech.Clarence Jones, who helped draft that speech, told NPR's Fresh Air in 2011 that it was Belafonte who explained to them how to use the power of television. ""He said,"" Jones recalled, ""'You have to look at this as a media event, not just as a march."" And so, for example, Harry was responsible for assembling what was called the 'celebrity delegation,' a lot of celebrities from Hollywood and performing artists. And he was very firm that they should sit in a certain strategic part on the podium, because he knew that the television cameras would pan to them, would look to them. And so he wanted to be sure that they were strategically situated, so that in looking at the celebrities, they'd also see a picture of the march and the other performers.""When Dr. King was held in a Birmingham jail, Belafonte raised money to bail him out. Coretta Scott King wrote in her autobiography, ""Whenever we got into trouble or when tragedy struck, Harry has always come to our aid, his generous heart wide-open.""His relationship with the King family later turned rocky, after Belafonte filed a lawsuit against King's estate in 2013, over the fate of three documents that the civil rights leader had given him, and which Belafonte tried to auction off in order to fund non-profit work; the family claimed that the singer and actor had ""wrongfully acquired"" the documents. Belafonte and the estate settled out of court the next year, with Belafonte retaining the materials.Throughout his career, Belafonte received numerous honors for his humanitarian work and the arts. He also helped organize Nelson Mandela's first trip to the U.S. after he was released from prison.He was also an outspoken critic of people in power, including President Obama, whom he once chastised for not showing enough concern for the poor. He singled out African-American artists Jay-Z and Beyonce, telling an interviewer they've ""turned their back on social responsibility."" Jay-Z responded on his track ""Nickels And Dimes"": ""Mr. Day O, major fail."" The two men eventually made up.Harry Belafonte was an activist into his 90s. He told NPR in 2011 that was something he learned from his mother.""She was tenacious about her dignity not being crushed. And one day, she said to me — she was talking about coming back from a day when she couldn't find work. Fighting back tears, she said, 'Don't ever let injustice go by unchallenged.'""As his good friend Sidney Poitier once put it, Belafonte was an ""invaluable energy force"" and ""always a gutsy guy.""Harry Belafonte is survived by his wife, Pamela Frank; four children; two stepchildren; and eight grandchildren.

One of its originators says it's time to address the deeper issue.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/31/laws-banning-critical-race-theory-in-schools-will-persist-one-of-its-originators-says-its-time-to-address-the-deeper-issue,"Kimberlé Crenshaw says laws passed now will still stand in a century, and it's long past time to protect the teaching of Black history.","As part of a recently passed African American history standards initiative, Florida public schools will now teach students that some Black people benefitted from slavery because it taught them useful skills. It’s not the only one of its kind. “That was shocking to people because they understood that that was minimizing what enslavement was all about. But the whole point ... of anti-wokeness is to fundamentally change the story of the continuing relevance of enslavement and segregation,” Kimberlé Crenshaw said on Boston Public Radio Monday. Crenshaw, the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, says that many members of the public see the topline problems of censorship, but they don’t see how deep the problems go. Recognizing the intersectionality of the issues of race, gender and ideology, she says, is key to addressing the ongoing attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion — and Black history, in particular — in education. It’s an issue she also sees in colleges, such as the recent affirmative action ruling from the Supreme Court that dictated universities can no longer use race-conscious admissions. So far this year, 40 bills have been introduced across the country restricting colleges from having offices and staff devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion. Of those, seven have become law in North Dakota, Tenneesse, Florida and Texas. As more bills aimed at restricting diversity efforts in schools and the teaching of Black American history are proposed in statehouses across the nation, Crenshaw says these measures' effects will last far longer than the politcians who introduced them. ""It chills teachers not to teach this material. That is still going to be on the books. That will last long after we don't even remember who [Gov. Ron] DeSantis was. That's what we have to wake up to,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's not just about 2024, it's really about the rest of this century."" Crenshaw created the concept of intersectionality and is one of the scholars behind critical race theory. Critical race theory is, in part, an academic framework to look at institutional racial bias rather than individual actors. In many corners, critical race theory — often shortened as CRT — has become an imprecise catchall for ideas or parts of American history that some would rather not see taught in schools. But the exact definition doesn't matter, according to Crenshaw. She said that right-wing outrage over CRT is less about the specific material being taught and more about the loss of identity among white individuals. ""Most of those people who are upset, going to a school board meeting, saying 'I don't want CRT in schools' — they couldn't define that. Racial justice, diversity, they couldn't define it. But they don't have to. All they need to do is be wound up with the message that: this is something that's taking something away from you,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's getting people upset about what they feel they're personally losing. And it's not necessarily material, it could be psychological. It is: 'We [white people] are no longer the center of American story, we have to share it with other people — and we have to share it with other stories.'"" In Feburary, after backlash from conservatives, the College Board expunged the topics of intersectionality, critical race theory, the queer experience and more from its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies. The move was highly criticized by civil rights advocates, including Crenshaw, and the College Board later walked it back in April.""We need to not racially appease. We need to realize that there's a long connection between racism and fascism and anti-Blackness — we're seeing it play out now,"" Crenshaw said. She says that putting up resistance to restrictions on Black education is vital. ""We need to recognize that when we see the likes of DeSantis, and others, coming after modest changes in the story that we tell about ourselves, that is calling us to defend the full narrative of the U.S. They're coming after those of us who value a multiracial democracy, so we need to show up as well,"" she said. Crenshaw will be participating in a panel Tuesday in Boston during the annual NAACP convention.",Local,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 19:34:43 EST",3bf29ccb3b9b2a8bd41c48def5c26121
648,Massachusetts residents are leaving the state. Why? And where are they going?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/30/massachusetts-residents-are-leaving-the-state-why-and-where-are-they-going,"A net 110,000 residents relocated to other states in just over two years — the highest number in 30 years.","Massachusetts is hemorrhaging people. In fact, it’s seeing the highest outmigration numbers in the last 30 years, according to a new report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. A net 110,000 people moved out of the Bay State over roughly the first two years of the pandemic within the United States, most of them between the ages of 26 and 35. The question is: why? Rent is certainly a factor. Boston has the second-highest median rent in the country after New York City. Traffic congestion and the many woes of the MBTA have also dominated headlines. But learning that the future of the workforce is leaving in record-high numbers has many waving red flags. Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the report in more detail.Arun Rath: So we know this is not a new trend necessarily, but these numbers are pretty arresting, especially since the 25- to 36-year-olds are the ones most likely to leave. What does this mean immediately for the future of the workforce here? Doug Howgate: I think it certainly should send some signals to policymakers and to everyone here in Massachusetts that a lot of the success that the state has had over the last few decades is something that we’re not necessarily entitled to. We need to think about how different long-standing demographic trends, pandemic-induced demographic trends and policy decisions, how they’re affecting location decisions and what we can do about it. Rath: Before we get into the “why,” tell us a bit about the “where.” Do we know where people are moving to? Howgate: I will say that one of the fascinating but frustrating things about a report like this is: you have to use a lot of different data sources. So, for example, a number you see in our report and a number of other reports is about 110,000 people leaving Massachusetts. That’s domestic outmigration — that’s people moving into and out of Massachusetts from other states. At the same time, we look at IRS data on tax returns, which is a little more dated, to give us better granular information on the ages of folks, their income levels and things like it. So it’s this kind of patchwork of different data sources that means that it’s easy to draw different conclusions. But I think they paint a pretty consistent picture of what is happening in terms of where folks are headed nationwide. There’s a trend of people heading from the north to the south. Northeastern states generally have lost about 800,000 people to domestic outmigration. Southern states have gained about 1.6 million people or so, so that’s a big factor. But one of the things that we find fascinating is that we’re starting to see some new competitors in Massachusetts. Maine and Vermont, for example, have actually seen upticks in their domestic in-migration while we’ve lost people, but that wasn’t the trend we saw prior to the pandemic. Rath: So let’s talk about that in terms of our immediate area, the ways in which we’re losing to other northeastern states. Howgate: I think that’s something that probably resonates with a lot of people anecdotally as well. We probably all know a couple of people who maybe have moved to the White Mountains or the south coast of Maine or wherever. I think what we’re seeing is a really interesting, probably pandemic-induced phenomenon. The question is, one, is it permanent? And two, what does it tell us? What I think it might tell us is, hey, picking up and moving to Texas or to Florida is still a big life decision. But if you have a job that enables you to work remotely, but you still want to keep a connection to the area — maybe moving to Maine or Vermont or New Hampshire — where you can probably afford housing for less, and you might have some different amenities. I think the value proposition for that has changed for a lot of folks dramatically, and we’re seeing that, at least for now, in the numbers. Rath: It’s interesting because I was just about to ask you about the tech sector aspect of these findings. We think of tech jobs being an asset for Massachusetts, but we’ve lost around 2,000 while other states have gained. Those seem to be portable jobs, so is that part of the pandemic migration? Howgate: Yeah. Again, we know what the data say, and then it’s about what conclusions we draw. We always have to be careful with that. But certainly, as we talk to folks in Massachusetts, what you often hear is that I.T. and tech jobs tend to be the most mobile. The other thing we know is that Massachusetts has had a pretty mature tech sector for a while, so part of this is likely that other states are simply catching up. But as you start to see that loss in jobs in Massachusetts, there’s a real concern about how to make sure we actually have a tech sector here in Massachusetts. Rath: You mentioned that one of your data sources is tax data. We know that last year, voters passed what some call the “millionaires tax,” an additional 4% tax on residents with incomes over $1 million. Do we have a sense from this data if we’re losing our millionaires? Howgate: So the data doesn’t tell us that yet; that tax went into effect on January 1st. I think one of the things we were trying to do with this report is a lot of the debate and discussion seems to be this very binary conversation about outmigration is solely about low-income families who can’t afford housing and childcare, or it’s solely about millionaires who are leaving the state. I think one of the things we wanted to indicate was that we’ve got to go where the data tells us. The reality is we had some pre-pandemic trends that created demographic headwinds for us. The pandemic seems to have accelerated some of those, and by the way, we’ve made some policy decisions like the surtax that have a very pronounced impact on a very small portion of our population, so we need to be concerned about what we can do to make sure those folks stay in the state as well. Rath: There are a lot of factors here, mainly the pandemic, that are out of our control. But in terms of things we can do, in terms of policy, what are some things that could reverse some of these trends? Howgate: Kind of like the policy challenges we face, in terms of the policy solutions, nothing is going to solve 100% of the problem or explain 100% of where we’re at. So it’s really about being holistic in our look at policy. We’ve supported tax relief, similar to what Gov. Maura Healey and the House have done. But what does that do? Is that going to totally change demographic trends in Massachusetts? No. But what it does do is update our rental tax deduction for the first time in 20 years. It does adjust our estate tax, which is the most onerous in the nation. It does increase property tax relief for senior citizens, which also hasn’t been updated in about 20 years. So what we view that proposal as, in addition to focusing on housing production, investing in K-12 education and things that make Massachusetts a place where people want to be. It’s got to be that kind of holistic approach to make sure that we’re arresting some of these trends and thinking about some of the factors that go into location decisions. And transportation, too; I think we all see the transportation challenges we continue to have in terms of traffic and reliability. That’s a factor we’ve got to focus on as well.",Local,"Tue, 30 May 2023 18:44:10 EST",867e26700c53c85fd4e46ca744145445
5984,Independent investigation begins in fatal Cambridge police shooting,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/24/independent-investigation-begins-in-fatal-cambridge-police-shooting,A judge will investigate the fatal shooting of Sayed Faisal in January.,"An inquest has begun into the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge police officer last month, according to a press release from Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan on Thursday. Ryan requested the independent investigation by a judge last month, a move that family members and local officials hope will offer clarity and transparency. Faisal was a 20-year-old UMass Boston student and Cambridge resident, who appeared to be having a mental health crisis when he was killed on Jan. 4. He allegedly approached officers with a knife and was shot. Barbara Dougan, legal director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is representing Faisal's family and said the family welcomes the inquest. Unlike a grand jury investigation, family members — and officers involved in the shooting — can be present for the process. Judges can summon witnesses and examine relevant documents, often in coordination with the district attorney. Inquests typically take several months to conclude, after which the district attorney reviews the judge’s report and decides whether to pursue charges or not. “It’s going to be a process that's going to play out, a long-haul process that we're going to need all the support they can get,” Dougan said. “I guess if there's any goal, it’s not only to get justice for their son, but to prevent any other family from going through something like this.”In Massachusetts, all officer-involved shootings are investigated by county district attorneys. Ryan’s office has made it a practice of requesting inquests into fatal police shootings in Middlesex County since 2018. The killing of Faisal by Cambridge police stirred a strong community response, reported protests in Bangladesh and an ongoing response from the city’s government. “It’s a very frustrating thing that [the inquest] is going to take a couple of months,” said Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem. “There’s a lot of frustrations in the community that this has happened, and the police report and other things are not yet public. ... But all of the evidence, everything that people want to see, will be public at the end of the day. And I think that what is good and bad about our legal process is that we are very, very thorough. And so it takes a long time.”Also unlike a grand jury, at the end of an inquest, a detailed report and full transcript of the proceedings are made public. “An inquest is far more independent and leads to more transparency after the fact,” Dougan said. “I mean, during the investigation stage of the inquest, it's all closed to the public, but after the fact a report is made public. So there's more transparency, more independence, hopefully more accountability.” Azeem outlined responses the city is taking, including the recent announcement of implementing a body camera program for police and alternative responses to emergency calls that involve people in a mental health crisis. “We’re also not waiting for the monthslong inquest process to conclude,” Azeem said. “I personally don't use the word ‘tragic’ because it makes it seem as though there's nothing you could have done. And I do think that there are things that we can do and we are doing.” Cambridge police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick told GBH News that the department has conducted a number of recent trainings. One in December 2022, the month before Faisal’s killing, was “designed to provide officers with more response options to help them de-escalate incidents” involving mental health crises. He highlighted that officers regularly receive training on issues such as domestic violence, elder abuse and LGBTQ cultural competency. “Our officers are trained and prepared to handle the evolving demands placed on them,” Warnick said in an email. “There are a number of noteworthy trainings that CPD has been at the forefront of across the region and country.” Warnick said regular training programs also included emphases on veterans and PTSD, fair and impartial policing and management of aggressive behavior. Azeem added that the city is exploring more non-lethal response options for police, including Tasers, which he says are currently not used by the department. “We are also looking at it in a different aspect as well, which is: how can we use increased mental health resources?” Azeem said. “You know, police perhaps should not be the first line of defense for a mental health call. And if we can prevent these calls from even happening in the first place, that would be wonderful.”Dougan said Faisal’s family is gratified that steps are being taken to decrease the likelihood of a similar deadly outcome with Cambridge police for someone in crisis. But, she added, that’s not their focus. “We’re not going to step in front of those folks who've already been working on this issue for years,” Dougan said, “[and] the family is not paying attention to body camera policies at this point. Other people are, which is good and we’re glad they are. But they’re just still trying to get through each day with this gaping hole in their lives, which is the loss of their only child.”",Local,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 14:21:04 EST",4d3195201167c4785003019b9788c1a3
2099,Basic Black: How will Boston’s task force on reparations confront generational trauma caused by enslavement?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/17/basic-black-how-will-bostons-task-force-on-reparations-confront-generational-trauma-caused-by-enslavement,The local effort to reckon with history is getting underway.,"Communities across the nation are beginning the process of acknowledging the scope of the injustices done to Black people throughout their histories. Many local and state governments are developing initiatives for reparations to balance the scales.Here in Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu marked the start of Black History Month by announcing the members of a new task force to study reparations, noting the ""brutal practice of enslavement"" along with policies such as redlining, the busing crisis, exclusion from secure and stable housing, and more. The task force — a multigenerational group of historians, activists and students — is planning on meeting soon to discuss their ideas on how to approach the complexity of reparatory justice. As they do the meticulous work of documentation and reflection over the next year, the city will wait to look with a careful eye at their conclusions. Addressing systemic racism and the harms caused by slavery is about more than just financial compensation for descendants of enslaved people. Guests on Basic Black said the efforts should also work to address other challenges facing the African American community such as health care access, housing access, psychological harm and the erasure of Black history, among many other issues. Carrie Mays, a member of Boston's Task Force on Reparations and student at UMass Boston, said reparations should be viewed as a starting point for further conversation and work. ""Reparations is not going to stop police from killing Black men in the streets,"" Mays said. ""Reparations is not going to stop Black women from dying at the highest demographical number when it comes to the medical field. Reparations is not going to stop the mass incarceration machine system that we're seeing today."" Even though slavery was abolished more than 150 years ago, Mays said reparations are important because Black communities are still suffering at the expense of white supremacy, and white communities are still benefitting from privilege. ""You cannot talk about the systemic issues of today without talking about slavery, without talking about colonialism, without talking about how this is a connected timeline,"" Mays said. George “Chip” Greenidge, a task force member and founder and director of Greatest MINDS, said he's proud of Mayor Wu for taking on this initiative, which he said has been brewing for quite awhile. ""I really want to push on intergenerational poverty that we've seen in the city. I think there are certain families born and raised here that have been in the cycle of intergenerational poverty,"" Greenidge said. ""How can we help them break through those cycles?"" Overall, there simply won't be enough money to compensate all descendants of slaves, said Traci Griffith, director of the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. That's why compensation will have to come in more creative ways that address harms such as redlining, busing and other inequities. ""I would really strongly urge the task force to look at the multiple ways in which compensation could happen. It isn't necessarily a dollar amount. It really feels as if there's so many other ways in which it can be addressed, and I think they really need to be creative about that,"" Griffith said. The Boston Task Force on Reparations has 10 members. It is currently looking for a research partner to aid in studying the lasting impacts of slavery in Boston. A request for proposals will soon be issued.Watch the latest episode of Basic Black tonight at 7:30 p.m. on GBH 2 or live at the stream below. You can also watch on the GBH News YouTube channel.

He provided no more details.Fidencio Valencia, a child's uncle, told media outlet Noticias Caracol the children were starting to talk and one of them said they hid in tree trunks to protect themselves in a jungle area filled with snakes, animals and mosquitoes. He said they were exhausted.""They at least are already eating, a little, but they are eating,"" he said after visiting them at the military hospital in Bogota, Colombia. A day earlier, Defense Minister Iván Velásquez had said the children were being rehydrated and couldn't eat food yet.The children were traveling with their mother from the Amazonian village of Araracuara to San Jose del Guaviare when the plane went down.The Cessna single-engine propeller plane was carrying three adults and the four children when the pilot declared an emergency due to engine failure. The small aircraft fell off the radar a short time later and a search for survivors began.Dairo Juvenal Mucutuy, another uncle, told local media that one of kids said he wanted to start walking.""Uncle, I want shoes, I want to walk, but my feet hurt,"" Mucutuy said the child told him.""The only thing that I told the kid (was), 'when you recover, we will play soccer,' "" he said.The children survived on cassava flour and seedsAuthorities and family members have said the children survived eating cassava flour and seeds, and that some familiarity with the rainforest's fruits were also key to their survival. The kids are members of the Huitoto Indigenous group.After being rescued on Friday, the children were transported in a helicopter to Bogota and then to the military hospital, where President Gustavo Petro, government and military officials, as well as family members met with the children on Saturday.An air force video released Friday showed a helicopter using lines to pull the youngsters up because it couldn't land in the dense rainforest where they were found. The military on Friday tweeted pictures showing a group of soldiers and volunteers posing with the children, who were wrapped in thermal blankets. One of the soldiers held a bottle to the smallest child's lips.Gen. Pedro Sanchez, who was in charge of the rescue efforts, said that the children were found 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from the crash site in a small forest clearing. He said rescue teams had passed within 20 to 50 meters (66 to 164 feet) of where the children were found on a couple of occasions but had missed them.Two weeks after the crash, on May 16, a search team found the plane in a thick patch of the rainforest and recovered the bodies of the three adults on board, but the small children were nowhere to be found.Soldiers on helicopters dropped boxes of food into the jungle, hoping that it would help sustain the children. Planes flying over the area fired flares to help search crews on the ground at night, and rescuers used speakers that blasted a message recorded by the siblings' grandmother telling them to stay in one place.Colombia's army sent 150 soldiers with dogs into the area, where mist and thick foliage greatly limited visibility. Dozens of volunteers from Indigenous tribes also joined the search.Ranoque, the father of the youngest children, said the rescue shows how as an ""Indigenous population, we are trained to search"" in the middle of the jungle.""We proved the world that we found the plane... we found the children,"" he added.The Colombian government, which is trying to end internal conflicts in the country, has highlighted the joint work of the military and Indigenous communities to find the children.

Campbell shared the news amid a push from her office to raise awareness about legal protections for young people from labor abuses, especially in immigrant communities.“What we do see is a cross section of the children that are more likely to be exploited are children who live in low-income communities, immigrants, communities of color,” Campbell said. “That's not by accident, it’s the way systems are designed. That's where people go to exploit folks because of lack of information and language barriers.” The attorney general’s office is launching a child labor working group to “identify investigations targets” and develop new practices to enforce the labor laws on the books. Her office’s Fair Labor Division enforces the laws that govern youth employment. Within the past three years, the Office’s Fair Labor Division cited nearly 130 employers for violating Massachusetts child labor laws, with penalties totaling almost over $1.3 million. Those citations affected roughly 2,000 minors from across the state, according to Campbell. Her office later confirmed some of those employers subjugated immigrant minors to child labor exploitation.Between October 2021 to April 2023, over 4,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in Massachusetts, according to federal data from the Office of Refugee Resettlement. This number doesn’t include youth who arrived with their families. Campbell said the settlement with Dave & Buster's included $275,000 in restitution to resolve allegations of labor violations in multiple locations, a figure that includes compensation for more than 800 employees. The company was cited for not providing meal breaks of at least 30 minutes to employees who worked shifts lasting longer than six hours, not obtaining work permits for minors before they began employment and by employing 16- or 17-year-old minors for later hours than permitted by law. The complaint was launched by a parent who alleged their child was made to work past midnight on a weeknight.A spokesperson for Dave and Buster's could not be reached for comment. “Even over the past year, multiple fast-food restaurants and dining establishments across the state have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for violating child labor laws,” said Liam Quinn, youth programs director at the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety. “These violations include young people working too many hours, working with deep-fat fryers, high-speed ovens, and have resulted in multiple youth being burned.” Campbell said her office is issuing a guidance to remind employers of labor laws to ensure minors are safe at work, including a reminder of the state $15 hourly wage for workers age 15 and older. Minors under 14 cannot legally work, with the few exceptions of babysitting, working as a news carrier, working on farms, or working in entertainment with a special waiver. Campbell says her office is also meeting regularly with immigrant worker centers and providing know-your-rights education to vulnerable communities. It recently sent letters to all state public school superintendents responsible for issuing work permits to minors and fact sheets in multiple languages to be distributed among guardians of high school students about the rights of immigrant workers and labor trafficking. According to Gladys Vega, the executive director of the Chelsea-based service organization La Colaborativa, parents are often behind the long hours their children work. “Sometimes parents don't know any different. Sometimes parents are worried about paying the coyote they need to pay whatever they left behind in their country wherever they borrow the money to come here. So everyone in that family has to work,” she said. Vega said that at least 250 children work in Chelsea alone, and often parents rely on their teenagers’ checks for utility bills. In one instance, Vega said a 15-year-old skinned his finger on a machine in the deli department of a supermarket while he was working in a position he wasn’t supposed to be working in.

454,A surprise-billing law loophole? Her pregnancy led to a six-figure hospital bill,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/28/a-surprise-billing-law-loophole-her-pregnancy-led-to-a-six-figure-hospital-bill,"It was the first day of her family's vacation in the San Juan Islands last June when Danielle Laskey, who was 26 weeks pregnant, thought she was leaking amniotic fluid.","It was the first day of her family's vacation in the San Juan Islands last June when Danielle Laskey, who was 26 weeks pregnant, thought she was leaking amniotic fluid.A registered nurse, Laskey called her OB-GYN back home in Seattle, who said to seek immediate care. Staff members at a nearby emergency department found no leakage. But her OB-GYN still wanted to see her as soon as possible.Laskey and her husband, Jacob, made the three-hour trip to the Swedish Maternal & Fetal Specialty Center-First Hill. Laskey had sought the clinic's specialized care for this pregnancy, her second, after a dangerous complication with her first: The placenta had become embedded in the uterine muscles.Back in Seattle, doctors at the clinic found Laskey's water had broken early, posing a serious risk to her and the fetus, and ordered her immediate admission to Swedish Medical Center/First Hill. She delivered her son after seven weeks in the hospital. Though she was treated for multiple postpartum complications, she was well enough to be discharged the next day. Her son, who is healthy, went home a month later.Laskey soon developed a fever and body aches, and she was told by her OB-GYN to go to Swedish's emergency department. She said doctors there wanted to admit her when she arrived Aug. 20 and scheduled a procedure for Aug. 26 to remove a fragment of placenta that her body had not eliminated on its own.Laskey, who had already spent weeks away from her 3-year-old daughter, chose to go home. She returned for the procedure, which went well, and she was home the same day.Then the bills came.The Patient: Danielle Laskey, 31, was covered by a state-sponsored plan offered by her employer, a local school district, and administered by Regence BlueShield.Medical Service: In-patient hospital services for 51 days, plus a one-day stay that included a second placenta removal procedure.Service Provider: Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, part of Providence Health & Services, a large, nonprofit, Catholic health system.Total Bill: Swedish, through Regence, billed about $120,000 in cost sharing for Laskey's initial hospitalization and about $15,000 for her second visit and procedure.What Gives: The specialized clinic caring for Laskey before her hospital admission was in her insurance plan's network. The clinic's doctors admit patients only to Swedish Medical Center, one of the Seattle area's only specialized providers for Laskey's condition — which, given that connection, she assumed was also in the network.So after being urgently admitted to Swedish, Laskey believed her bills would be largely covered, with the couple expected to pay $2,000 at most for their portion of in-network care because of her plan's out-of-pocket cost limit.It turned out Swedish Medical Center was out of network for Laskey's plan and, at first, Regence determined that Laskey's hospitalizations were not emergencies. Jacob said that in November a Regence case manager initially told him that his wife's lengthy hospitalization was an emergency admission and out-of-network charges would not apply. But then he said the case manager called back and said the charges would apply after all, because Danielle had not come in through the emergency department.Both Washington state and federal laws prohibit insurers and providers from billing patients for out-of-network charges in emergency situations. The couple said neither Swedish nor Regence told them before or during the two hospitalizations that Swedish was out of network, and that they never knowingly signed anything agreeing to accept out-of-network charges.Jacob, who works as a psychiatrist at a different hospital, said he mentioned the surprise-billing laws to the Regence case manager, but she replied that the laws did not apply to his family's situation.It was only after Regence was contacted by KHN that the insurer explained its reasoning to the reporter: Regence said the Swedish hospital, while out of network for Danielle, had a broader contract with the insurer as a ""participating provider"" and so the insurer was not in violation of surprise-billing laws by approving Swedish's out-of-network coinsurance charges.The broader contract allowed Swedish to bill members of any Regence plan who receive out-of-network services there 50% coinsurance — the patient's portion of the overall cost the insurer allows the provider to charge — with no out-of-pocket maximum for the patient.What's the difference between a hospital that's ""in network"" and one that's a ""participating provider""? In this case, by contracting with Regence as an out-of-network but also participating provider, Swedish straddled the line between being in and out of network — designations that traditionally indicate whether a provider has a contract with an insurer or not.Setting the terms with an insurer for providing its members emergency or other care appears to allow hospitals to sidestep new surprise-billing laws that prevent out-of-network providers from charging high, unpredictable rates in emergencies, according to government and private-sector medical billing experts.Experts said they had not heard of out-of-network providers evading surprise-billing laws by being contracted as ""participating providers"" until KHN asked about Laskey's case.Ellen Montz, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said that under the federal No Surprises Act, the definition of a ""participating"" emergency facility that's subject to the law's surprise-billing protections depends on whether the facility has a contract with the insurer specifying the terms and conditions under which an emergency service is provided to a plan member.Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy who studies out-of-network billing, said Laskey's case seems to fall into a ""weird"" gray area of the state and federal laws protecting patients from out-of-network charges in emergency situations.If there had been no contract between Regence and Swedish, the laws clearly would have prohibited those charges. But since there was a contract specifying a 50% coinsurance rate when Swedish was out of network for a particular Regence plan, those laws may not apply, Fiedler said.After he declined to apply for the hospital's financial assistance program, Jacob said Swedish also notified them in November that they had two months to pay or be sent to collections.Natalie Kozimor, a spokesperson for Providence Swedish, said the hospital disagreed with ""some of the details and characterizations of events"" presented by the Laskeys, though she did not specify what those were. She said Swedish assisted Danielle with her appeal to Regence.""We had no luck with Swedish taking any role or responsibility with regard to our billing or advocating on our behalf,"" Jacob said. ""They basically just referred us to their financial department to put us on a payment plan.""The Resolution: In December, the couple appealed Regence's approval of Swedish's out-of-network charges for the 51-day hospitalization, claiming it was an emergency and that there was no in-network hospital with the expertise to treat her condition. They also filed a complaint with the state insurance commissioner's office.The office told KHN that the ""participating provider"" contract does not override the laws barring out-of-network charges in emergency situations. ""Danielle had an emergency and Regence acknowledges it was an emergency, so she cannot be balance-billed,"" said Stephanie Marquis, public affairs director for the Washington state Office of the Insurance Commissioner.On Jan. 13, Regence said it would grant the Laskeys' appeal to cover the first hospitalization as an in-network service, erasing the biggest part of Swedish's bill but still leaving the family on the hook for the $15,000 bill for Danielle's second visit and procedure.On Jan. 27, two days after KHN contacted Regence and Swedish about Danielle Laskey's case, a Regence representative called and informed her that her second hospitalization also would be reclassified as an in-network service.Ashley Bach, a Regence spokesperson, confirmed to KHN that both stays now will be covered as emergency, in-network services, eliminating Swedish's coinsurance charges. But in what appears to be contrary to the insurance commissioner's stance, he said the bills had not violated state or federal laws prohibiting out-of-network charges in emergency situations because of the contract with Swedish covering all its plans.""Under the Washington state and federal balance-billing laws, the definitions of whether a provider is considered in network hinges on whether there is a contract with a specific provider,"" Bach said.The Takeaway: More than a year after the federal surprise-billing law took effect, patients can still get hammered by surprise bills resulting from health plans' limited provider networks and ambiguities about what is considered emergency medical care. The loopholes are out there, and patients like Danielle Laskey are just discovering them.Washington state Rep. Marcus Riccelli, chair of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, said he will ask the state's public and private insurers what steps they could take to avoid provider network gaps and out-of-network billing surprises like this. He said he will also review whether there is a loophole in state law that needs to be closed by the legislature.Fiedler said policymakers need to consider addressing what looks like a gap in the new laws protecting consumers from surprise bills, since it's possible that other insurers across the country have similar contracts with hospitals. ""Potentially this is a significant loophole, and it's not what lawmakers were aiming for,"" he said.Congress might have to fix the problem, since the federal agencies that administer the No Surprises Act may not have authority to do anything about it, he added.Bruce Alexander, a CMS spokesperson, said the Departments of Health & Human Services, Labor, and Treasury are looking into this issue. While the agencies can't predict whether a new rule or guidance will be needed to address it, he said, ""they remain committed to protecting consumers from surprise medical bills.""In the meantime, patients, even in emergencies, should ask their doctors before a hospital admission whether the hospital is in their plan network, out of network, or (watch for these words) a ""participating provider.""As the Laskeys discovered, hospital billing departments may offer little help in resolving surprise billing. So, while it is worth contesting questionable charges to the provider, it's also usually an option to quickly appeal to your state insurance department or commissioner.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

223,Boston Police Commissioner Cox supports ending dismissal appeals,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/07/boston-police-commissioner-supports-ending-dismissal-appeals,"“I think if we fire somebody, they should stay fired,” said Commissioner Michael Cox.","Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox expressed support Tuesday for removing arbitration as an option for fired officers to regain employment. Cox, who officially assumed leadership of the department in August, said the police department should also improve the quality of its internal investigations and its disciplinary history records.“I think if we fire somebody, they should stay fired,” said Cox while marking his inaugural appearance on Boston Public Radio. “That being said, I think we also need to own the fact that we need to do better investigations to make sure that they stay fired — to make sure that we’re contacting the people appropriately, make sure we’re documenting things along the way, so it makes it a whole lot harder for an arbitrator to rule against us.”Cox echoed a sentiment held by his boss, Mayor Michelle Wu, who campaigned on a pledge to achieve certain reforms through a renegotiated contract agreement with the city’s police force. The Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association, the city’s largest police union that represents rank and file officers, attempted to halt negotiations late last year after the organization sought intervention from the Joint Labor Management Committee, the states’ collective bargaining oversight and dispute resolution agency. The Wu administration asserts the collective bargaining process is ongoing. Wu has said publicly that establishing parameters for dismissals that cannot be appealed is a red line for her administration in the talks.Cox said in his view, arbitration awards have ""far been too generous"" to police unions in representation about fired individuals coming back on.“Either an officer belongs on the job, or they don’t — and our job is to make sure that we investigate and do all we can to separate the ones that don't belong here,” he added.Mayor Michelle Wu announced Cox as her selection last July after the force had only interim leadership for more than a year.The commissioner took the helm of a department sieged by multiple scandals involving past and pending investigations, among them: the conviction of a former police union head for child abuse allegations corroborated while he was an officer decades before; the sudden dismissal of a former commissioner over decades old domestic abuse allegations; and the alleged participation of at least one officer in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That investigation, which has now dragged on for nearly two years, will “soon” end, Cox said, parroting an assertion from Wu last month. “I’m not going to comment on something pending beforehand so we can have a reason for someone to arbitrate against us,” he said to laughter.Cox also expressed support for police officers being stationed in public schools, arguing that the exposure could counter stereotypes and fear.“When my kids were little and they were afraid of the dark, I didn't say, ‘Never walk into the dark again.’ I tried to help them through it … and let them know, you turn a light on and see it’s nothing to be afraid of here. There's nothing to be afraid of about policing,” Cox said. “Policing being done now is better than it's ever been done in the history of policing. But the reality is the narrative that's out there is almost the opposite because of social media and things of that nature. When you have to scan the entire United States to find one example here or one example there, that is not a systemic problem.”",Politics,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 16:31:54 EST",2b18a141b16c221cfc8d4514c89bd83b

And how reliable are juries, really?",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/14/why-do-we-have-jury-duty-and-how-reliable-are-juries-really,GBH legal analyst Daniel Medwed on the custom's past and present.,"Ahead of his first-ever jury service, GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel asked legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed about the history and the current-day practice of jury trials. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, in two days, I am going to be part of a jury, potentially part of a jury. I have to report for jury duty, which is something I've actually never had to do in my whole life. Daniel Medwed: Is this congratulations or condolences? Siegel: Yeah, I think more condolences in my case. I'm not actually super excited to potentially be doing jury duty. Medwed: To fulfill your civic duty, Jeremy. Siegel: Well, that's true. I guess I will be fulfilling my civic duty as an American citizen. So tell me a little bit about how that became a thing. Why is it a thing that I have to do jury duties? What's the background and the history of how this became a thing in America? Medwed: Sure. Like so many aspects of our legal system, we inherited it from Ye Olde England, and the first juries in England date back to the Middle Ages. They were called juries of recognition, and they were used in land disputes. Members of the community would come forward to recognize, from memory, who had received title to particular parcels of land from William the Conqueror. That's sort of the origin. And then by the 1400s, it evolved, and it looked a little bit like it looks today, where juries serve as finders of fact. They collect evidence, they evaluate the evidence, they weigh the credibility of witnesses, and ultimately render a verdict. So the right to a jury trial now in the United States is enshrined in our Constitution. For criminal cases, it's in the Sixth Amendment and for civil cases, where a certain amount of money is at stake, it's in the Seventh Amendment. Siegel: So I'm hearing that I have England and William the Conqueror to thank for my jury duty. Medwed: Exactly. It's a straight throughline from William the Conqueror to Jeremy Siegel. Siegel: So I know that juries aren't the case for every criminal situation. Someone can waive their right to a jury and try their luck before a judge too, right? Why would that be the case? Medwed: On the one hand, the rule of the road essentially is: If you're in a criminal case in particular, and the facts are really gory, really gruesome, a defendant might opt for a judge — it's called a bench trial — instead of a jury, based on the idea that the judge has sort of seen it all and won't be swayed by the gruesome, gory details of the case; can be more objective and dispassionate; and dispense justice in a way that might be more measured than a jury, that could be inflamed by these facts. On the other hand, that calculus differs depending on the orientation of the judge. If the judge is really punitive, really tough on crime, it might be a very different equation. And you might want to go with a jury even in a case with bad facts, because all you have to do is get one juror on your side to vote to acquit. Then you can hang the jury and get a mistrial. Siegel: Okay. So that was actually going to be the next thing that I asked about here: in order to be convicted of something, or to be acquitted, you need everybody in the jury to be on the same page?Medwed: Yes. This idea of jury unanimity in criminal cases is an interesting one. And actually the Supreme Court only resolved it definitively relatively recently, in a 2020 case called Ramos. So here's the background: In Ye Olde England, common law unanimity was the norm. You had to have unanimous juries in criminal cases. And there's an instance of one of these from like 1367. And this idea of unanimity crossed the pond, and it's a part of federal law and virtually every state law. However — and this is what sort of interesting — there is nothing in the Constitution explicitly that talked about unanimous juries in criminal cases. So Louisiana and Oregon were outliers for a long time, and they allowed people to be convicted based on votes that are 10-to-2 or 11-to-1 in favor of conviction. They both backtracked. Those states have backtracked from that in part because the Supreme Court, in that 2020 case I mentioned, finally said, hey, you know what, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under our federal Constitution implicitly carries a requirement that the jury verdict be unanimous. And therefore, we should have unanimous juries in the states as well. That hasn't stopped Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis from making waves about going back to non-unanimous juries. But I think as a matter of constitutional law, it seems like unanimous juries are here to stay in the criminal case context, at least. Siegel: So, Daniel, as you were talking about people coming to a consensus, everybody agreeing on something in order for there to be an acquittal or a conviction, it made me think about how difficult that could be for a bunch of ordinary citizens performing their civic duty, and all of the debate that happens behind closed doors between jurors. I guess I'm curious about why someone who gets caught up in the criminal justice system for one reason or another and ends up in a jury trial — why should we trust the system, at the end of the day?Medwed: I'm not so sure we do. So here's the theory is this, and then we'll talk about the practice. The theory is that you bring 12 fair and impartial citizens who represent a cross-section of the community harmed by the crime, usually within the county, the jurisdiction. If you bring them all together, they'll bring their disparate experiences to the fore, and through a full and frank conversation in the deliberation room, without outside influence, without outside supervision, they'll arrive at a just outcome. That's sort of the theory. You get 12 different people from our very diverse country, bring them all together in a room to talk about facts, and essentially a good result will occur. But the practice is much uglier than that, right? Because there are a lot of tools in the tool chest of prosecutors in particular to shape the jury in a particular way. There's a very sordid history in the United States of prosecutors using what are called peremptory challenges — you can challenge jurors for no articulable reason in criminal cases — that they were challenged based on racial bias. For instance, in a case involving a Black defendant, prosecutors would often try to craft all-white juries. There have been Supreme Court cases that have said you can't do this, but there are a lot of pernicious activities that could be done. Also, another reality of this, of course, is that 12 people in a room won't necessarily all have their voices heard and respected equally. There might be one person who dominates the conversation. It's sort of unclear what the dynamics of the deliberation room might be. So I'm actually pretty skeptical about whether juries work or not. Siegel: So real quick, Daniel, before I let you go, let's say someone, after having this conversation wasn't too excited about their jury duty coming up in a couple days. And in theory, let's say you wanted to get off of a jury. How would you go about doing that? Medwed: I can't imagine anyone would want to do that. Certainly nobody that I know and talk with at least weekly would ever want to do that. I think, Jeremy, essentially you can be excused what's called for cause, if there is some cause. If you have a conflict of interest, you have a financial stake in the case, you know one of the parties — that's sort of easy. You're going to get bounced for that. If you have a clear time commitment that makes it impossible for you to serve, a judge might actually allow you to leave as well. If you express misgivings about the case, for instance, you say, 'I could never convict somebody. I don't believe in criminal justice. I don't believe in prison.' That might also be a basis for getting a bounced. Unfortunately, Jeremy, being the co-host of Morning Edition isn't necessarily an excuse because you have Paris who can help out. You are indispensable to us, but, you know, possibly you could have one day off or one week off to do your civic duty.",Local,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 12:07:08 EST",05738717b1cf4c0b3dae13018eca89aa

Eng, the former president of the MTA’s Long Island Rail Road in New York, rode from Park Street to Boylston and spoke with T riders about their experience with the transit system. “To the people who have lost faith in the T, I tell them, ‘Stay tuned,’” he said. “I’m gonna demonstrate we can turn it around. We’re gonna talk about the issues openly. Once they start to hear the plan and we put that plan on paper, publicly share it, people will see that we have a strategy.” Advocates like Jim Aloisi, the former Massachusetts transportation secretary, and Stacy Thompson, executive director of Livable Streets Alliance, are hopeful that Eng’s vision will harden into concrete actions and benchmarks — ones that will be shared with the public. “I think he did a good job today just by riding the T and, you know, making himself available,” Aloisi said on Boston Public Radio Monday. Aloisi praised Eng for effectively presenting a “vision” but said he needs to put forward a more detailed and transparent strategy for eliminating the issue of slow subway lines. The former Massachusetts transportation secretary said he would like to see Eng develop a plan by Labor Day with clear deadlines for when the MBTA’s slow zones will be eliminated. One major problem the MBTA has yet to solve: staffing. The agency reduced service after an initial safety report that the Federal Transit Administration issued last year that found that the MBTA was understaffed and dangerously overworked. It’s launched several hiring initiatives to try to attract workers to jobs with dire shortages to take work operating buses and dispatching the subways. “There are three things [Eng] knows he needs to do on day one ... that’s hiring, money, diversions. We know we have to continue with the diversions with repairs over the summer,” Thompson added. “The public wants to know when they’re gonna happen, how they’re gonna happen.”Another report from Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation also identified the shortage of staff as the T biggest’s concern. “We need to hire enough bus operators that, by September, we’re running more service,” Thompson said. “It’s that simple.” The MBTA is also currently executing a Capital Investment Plan that went into effect in summer 2022, laying out major projects for the next five years. Some of the projects Aloisi says are priorities for the still-new Gov. Maura Healey, like investing in regional rail, funding for the MBTA’s Red-Blue line connector and electrifying the Fairmount and Providence lines, can’t be found in that plan. “[We] have in real-time, right now, this month, public hearings on the MBTA’s Capital Investment Plan,” Aloisi said. “That is a Charlie Baker legacy plan. It does not reflect, in my judgment, the full amplitude of the Healey administration’s policies.” Some may have lost faith in the MBTA but Thompson believes there’s still hope. She thinks that Eng’s “fixer” attitude will make ideas, such as hiring more skilled staff, a reality. “I liked the optimism in Eng’s message today ... because everything single one of these challenges is fixable,” she said. “These are not actually hard.”",Local,"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:18:33 EST",73d499070be7096a926f21755e4f3ad3

John Keenan said on Greater Boston. “Everywhere they turn they are just being hit with this advertising.”Keenan said sports betting ads have almost become inescapable, appearing on everything from trash cans to billboards. He said the constant exposure becomes an issue for those at risk of addiction and those who have struggled with gambling addiction in the past.Keenan said the strict regulations that exist for ads and promotions surrounding tobacco, alcohol and cannabis products are not in place for sports betting. He said companies use terminology such as ""no sweat bet"" or ""risk-free betting"" to be deceptive or misleading to customers. He cautioned that ""the house always wins"" in the long-term.Victor Ortiz, director of the Office of Problem Gambling Services, said gambling addiction shares many of the characteristics of substance addictions.“A few years ago it was integrated as a substance addiction,” Ortiz said. “When you examine gambling addiction and substance addiction there is a profound overlap.”Ortiz said his office has approached problem gambling treatment with similar strategies to substance abuse treatment.“We integrated the [gambling] helpline three years ago with the substance abuse helpline,” Ortiz said.Keenan said what remains to be seen is the impact gambling addiction in the commonwealth will have on things like domestic violence and other issues in the home, especially any effects on children.“All of that is a silent cost and it’s hard to quantify it.

519,"Over 100,000 Mass. residents could see thousands taken out of their tax refunds",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/24/over-100-000-mass-residents-could-see-thousands-taken-out-of-their-tax-refunds,"The state is trying to take back $1 billion in overpaid unemployment benefits, much of which dates back to the early days of the pandemic.","For 112,000 residents who were overpaid unemployment benefits in the past few years, the state is coming to collect. Overpayments are not unusual for unemployment. About 2% of all unemployment payments, or roughly $30 million, were overpayments in Massachusetts in 2019, per the state’s Department of Unemployment Assistance. But chaos in the early days of the pandemic and short-term federal programs — rapidly built, executed and shuttered — made the money owed now at a magnitude that’s anything but normal. Administrative errors, fraud and confusion about who qualified for new, short-term federal programs led to billions being overpaid. After years of forgiveness efforts slowly whittled down that sum, the department is now trying to get $719 million back from taxpayers on this year’s tax refunds. The 112,000 claimants owe, on average, $6,400 to the federal and state government. Any tax refunds that would be given to a claimant will instead be put toward paying down their debt to the unemployment overpayments.“There has been tremendous outreach that has been done to date, especially through a campaign last year, to reach as many claimants as possible,” Lauren Jones, Massachusetts’ secretary of labor, told GBH News. But it still won’t put an end to the multiyear problem. There are tens of thousands more people whose money isn’t being taken out of their tax refunds this year — but the state still plans to recoup their money, so their time will eventually come.The conditions in 2020 created a “powder keg,” as Rory MacAneney, an employment attorney at Community Legal Aid, explained it. Overnight shutdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic created a sudden need that the state’s Department of Unemployment Assistance tried to fill, with help from new federal programs. The amount of money distributed in 2020 — a total of $21 billion — was 15 times more than what it gave out in 2019. More than two-thirds of the overpayments were tied to federal pandemic programs. “You’ve got the combination of: state workforce agencies aren’t able to work in person, they don’t have all their usual facilities, they are trying to learn how to do things remotely,” MacAneney said. “They’re facing a huge increase in the number of people who are applying for regular unemployment. And on top of that now, they’re also getting people who are applying for these pandemic programs, and each of the federal pandemic programs had its own sort of guidance.”Governments often take back unemployment overpayments through tax intercepts. But it’s unusual for governments to be coming to collect years later. It’s only happening now because of a multiyear pause during the pandemic.“I’ve had people who had no idea that there was an overpayment on their account,” MacEnaney said. “It’s from, like, 2015 ... and they’re just finding out now.” The 112,000 claimants whose tax refunds will be intercepted this year, if they’re not in the process of applying for a waiver, are the group that’s been extensively narrowed down and been contacted several times by the department, Jones said.“They never qualified for that one-click waiver program, nor did they take any action from all the previous attempts that we’ve tried through the additional relief programs that the Department of Unemployment Assistance has provided,” she said. Jones isn’t sure how much the state will get back with the refunds. “Every case is really going to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. And we also don’t know how much of a refund people would be eligible to receive,” she said.Another 59,000 people who collectively owe roughly $370 million are still on the hook with the state and federal governments. What sets them apart from those whose refunds may be intercepted is that they qualified for a “one-click waiver” last year. But they didn’t click before it closed in October. They won’t have it taken out of their tax refunds as the state conducts more outreach to figure out repayment plans. Jones said that her department cannot reopen the waiver under state and federal law. Employment lawyers suggest that anyone facing a debt to the state applies for what’s commonly called a “hardship waiver,” which could wipe the balance they owe if their expenses are more than they’re earning — or if they meet other criteria outlined on the state’s website. Some still hope that the state will opt to forgive more of the money that’s owed. Lydia Edwards, a state senator representing parts of Boston, Winthrop and Revere, sees payments from the early days of the pandemic as a crucial tool that helped workers and businesses stay stable during a tumultuous time. She proposed a bill that would give the Department of Unemployment Assistance the power to waive any overpayments for “non-fault” cases: in other words, where the applicant was not at fault. “What I find abhorrent is that when there were true mistakes made — the person didn’t do this, didn’t try to defraud the government — they’re now being stuck with some bills I’ve heard as high as $50,000 to pay back the unemployment,” she said, saying such forgiveness would be similar to the government forgiving PPP loans.Jones did not take a stance on the bill. “We’d have to see how that plays out in the legislative process,” she said.",Local,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 10:00:29 EST",b772658fdc0987eca983291972967014

Not until later, after a tow truck came, did anyone realize someone was in the vehicle — and that they were still alive. ""We do not know how long the Jeep was in the water,"" Capt. Chuck Rogers, an investigator at the Marion County Sheriff's Office, told NPR. And that's just one of several questions that remain unanswered about the unusual case. After that initial call on Friday morning, it took deputies around 18 minutes to reach the scene at Lake o' the Pines, which sits between Dallas and Shreveport, La. It took a little longer for a truck from a nearby wrecker service to arrive. The Jeep was far from shore, about 40 feet out in the water from Woody's Camp Boat Ramp. The fisherman who called the authorities stuck around, using his boat to help a tow-truck worker get out to the Jeep and hook up a tow cable, Rogers said. ""It was at that time they saw the woman"" inside the Jeep, the captain added. Abruptly, what began as a salvage job became a rescue. The fisherman and tow-truck driver helped get the woman out of the vehicle, pulling her into the fishing boat. Deputies called an ambulance; in the meantime, the woman was put in a car to keep her warm. She was later taken to a hospital.The woman's identity has not been released.""During the incident, it was determined the woman was listed as a missing person from the Longview Texas Police Department,"" the Marion County Sheriff Office said.She had been reported missing hours earlier — at 12:35 a.m. on Friday — police in Longview, a town some 24 miles south-by-southwest of the lake, told NPR.Longview police said they couldn't share any more details about the woman or the circumstances that might have led to her predicament.""Given the details of this case, we are unable to release any information at this time,"" said Melissa Dobbs, records administrator at the Longview Police Department. As for how the Jeep came to be in the lake, the sheriff's department says it hasn't turned up anything suspicious about the incident. The boat ramp the vehicle apparently used to drive into the lake sits after a slight curve from a long and roughly straight rural road.""There was nothing uncovered during the investigation to suggest this case was anything more than an accident,"" Rogers said.

And it's tough because it kind of impacted me the rest of the night,"" said Tatum, who finished 5 of 13 from the field with 14 points. ""Swelled up. It was frustrating that I was a shell of myself, couldn't move.""Boston was looking to extend a wild postseason ride that already included five wins when facing elimination — twice in the East semifinals after falling behind 3-2 to the 76ers, and three straight times against the Heat.Instead, for the second straight year the Celtics' season ended with a team receiving a trophy on their home floor.Jaylen Brown led Boston with 19 points but struggled to find a groove while going just 8 for 23 from the field and 1 for 9 from the 3-point line.""Just a terrible game when my team needed me most,"" Brown said. ""JT hurt his ankle the first play of the game. You could see it swelling up. He couldn't move out there. ... I failed. It's tough. I give credit to Miami. But just a terrible job.""The Celtics cut what had been a 17-point third-quarter deficit to 10 entering the fourth. But Miami started the final period with a 7-0 spurt over the first 70 seconds from with Boston never recovered.Boston's 84 points in the night was a low for these playoffs.Along with Tatum's injury, Malcolm Brogdon also played through what he confirmed afterward was a partially torn tendon his right forearm. And Game 6 savior Derrick White kept his team in contention with 18 points, but left late after suffering a knee injury.""This is how the game is. Sometimes the ball doesn't roll your way,"" Brogdon said.Boston ended their postseason run 5-6 at home.""I thought in the first quarter and a half or so we continued to fight defensively, even though our shots weren't falling,"" coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""Then we just couldn't score.""It was a microcosm of a season that began with a coaching change the day before training camp after Ime Udoka was given a yearlong suspension for having an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the organization.Mazzulla took over and led Boston to a 57-win regular season and its fifth conference finals appearance in seven seasons.Now Boston enters an offseason that could change the franchise's immediate future with a decision to be made about Brown, who is eligible to receive a five-year contract extension worth as much as $295 million.But Brown said it's not something he'd even began to ponder as he comes to grips with the end of a playoff run he thought would last much longer.""I expected to win today and move on. That's what my focus was on. That's what my focus has been on. We failed. I failed. That's all I can think about at this moment.

The Pentagon once again dropped drag shows across U.S. military facilities after Republican politicians criticized the performances. And legislation across the country is targeting gender and sexuality education, drag shows and athletic participation for transgender youth. Boston Public Radio hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan asked listeners to call and text to share how the political climate is affecting their Pride this year.Laura Marotta from Worcester called in to share her experience trying to buy a hat from Target that said “Queer liberation is for everyone.” When she went to check out, a Target employee said the item had been recalled and they could not sell it. The employee then proceeded to remove the remaining hats off the shelf and into the back of the store.“I sat in my car and I cried,” Laura said. “I think these corporations [need to] give employees training on how to handle these situations instead of taking things away from us.”Susan in Plympton, who worked for Target until about four years ago, said the company’s decision doesn’t make sense. She remembers the backlash after Target announced its bathroom and fitting room policy in 2016 that allows people to use the facilities that match their gender.“They didn't back down from that when people were all upset about it,” Susan said. “So I'm really shocked that they're taking this position on merchandise, because it totally contradicts what they did several years ago for the restroom.”Several listeners were concerned about safety at upcoming events this month. “I used to look forward to Pride events in both Boston and Providence. Sadly, I’m too concerned about my personal safety anywhere I go. It would be nice if you could rely on law enforcement to enforce laws uniformly, but with so much variety of ... positions within the ranks, how could anyone feel safe going to a Pride event?” texted one listener. “I cannot tell you how unsafe my kids feel,” echoed Anne from Shrewsbury, whose two adult children are queer and have received death threats. Anne said she has “no faith” police will protect her family. Still, Anne shows Pride through bumper stickers. Those have prompted conversations from strangers in parking lots, including many who thank her for the support, and others who share a similar experience to her own. “I struck up a conversation with another mother of a trans young man, and we talked about how afraid we are for our kids in the United States of America.”Another parent who called in, Deb, said she strives for visibility. When she reps her Pride T-shirt or hat, that’s a visual invitation to engage with people with different beliefs.“I guess what I would invite anybody to do, of any political stance, is when you see me, approach me and feel comfortable enough to ask me a question,” Deb said.Her son is gay and transgender, and she remembers years ago watching him suffer through panic attacks and thoughts of suicide.“I truly believe that if my son were not in Massachusetts and was not able to get the care that he needed, I may not have him today,” said Deb.",Local,"Thu, 01 Jun 2023 19:20:08 EST",d077c768862f7949b6ad4597e0441002

They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center — and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose: As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff. While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university. In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022. Rath: In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose: We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction — or lack thereof — with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus. We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role — whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development — just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions. Rath: Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose: Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them. Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind. Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers. We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students. Rath: Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose: In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, ""OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?"" Rath: What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty? Rose: In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those. So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, ""OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?""There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great.",Education,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 17:37:21 EST",26a319d1db667ea77f3953fb56f10fca

Ed Markey said at an event announcing the grades along the Charles River in Cambridge. ""But this report card says we still have a long way to go, especially since we're being challenged by climate change.""The report card says extreme weather fluctuations linked to climate change have been impacting water quality in the watersheds. In 2021, record precipitation caused over 126 million gallons of sewage and storm water to be discharged into the Charles River. The following year, a severe drought caused the Charles to nearly run dry in places.Emily Norton, executive director of the Charles River Watershed Association, said urban areas along the river's path have worse water quality because they have more polluted stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows. She said the river is in better shape than it was in the mid-1990s — when the EPA launched the ""Clean Charles Initiative"" and former Gov. Bill Weld famously jumped into the dirty water — but progress has stalled in recent years.""People keep asking us: 'If Paris can make the Seine swimmable for the summer 2024 Olympics, why can't we swim in the Charles?' And frankly, it's a good question. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, called for fishable, swimmable rivers by 1983,"" Norton said.The report generally gives good grades for water quality in the Mystic River, but several tributaries rated poorly as a result of sewage contamination. Mill Creek flunked, and Alewife Brook and the Malden River got a grade of D.Markey noted that as a child, he was told by his mother not swim in the Malden River, because it wasn't clean enough. The new report gave that river a D grade.""So not enough has changed for those kids in Malden since the days when I was growing up there,"" Markey said. ""And that's why I urge all of our partners here to continue working together to secure healthy and safe watersheds for everyone."" ""We should all be leaning in for the next 20 years of work,"" said Mystic River Watershed Association Executive Director Patrick Herron. ""It's going to require a tremendous investment, a billion dollars of investment to actually have a clean waterway that we can all swim in and boat in."" The lakes and ponds of the Neponset River watershed also rank well for water quality. But, like the Mystic River watershed, the effects of both drought and increased precipitation have had a negative impact on smaller tributaries.""One of the things that is really clear from this year's data is the imprint of climate change on the results we're seeing,"" said Neponset River Watershed Association Executive Director Ian Cooke. ""This year we looked at three years' worth of data to compose the grades. One of those was a severe drought year. Two of them were very wet years."" Those intense downpours, Cooke said, have shifted what pollutants are harming our waterways.""Many of our lakes now are much more governed by fertilizer pollution and algae blooms in terms of their usability than they are the traditional bacteria indicator that we usually look at,"" he said. ""So definitely we need to do what we can to try to bend the curve on the future of climate change.""The water quality assessments are based on samples collected by hundreds of volunteers for the three watershed associations. Those samples are analyzed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which reports the results to the EPA.",Local,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:01:02 EST",8eb4e07361e517503d2311e99b95bd2d

The 23-year-old had been stationed in South Korea, but had recently been held in a prison there on charges of assault, the AP reported. While it is unclear how long he'd been incarcerated, according to CBS News, King was released to U.S. officials at the military hub in the country about a week ago. Before bolting into North Korea, King was being escorted to an airport outside of Seoul where he was expected to board a plane bound for Fort Bliss, Texas, to face military disciplinary action. Officials got him through airport security, but somehow King managed to ditch the escort and make his way out of the terminal and back to the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. That is where officials said King, who was dressed in civilian clothes, joined a tour of the Korean border village of Panmunjom.One member of the tour group described the incident on a now-deleted Facebook post, saying the King cried out, then ran between two buildings and eventually into North Korea. It is unclear if he planned to defect. Where is Travis King now?During a Tuesday press conference, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said officials believe King is in the custody of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""I'm absolutely foremost concerned about the welfare of our troop,"" Austin said.So far, there has been no official word from North Korea. King's mother, Claudine Gates who lives in Racine, Wis., told ABC News that she was shocked when Army officials told her on Tuesday that her son had fled. ""I can't see Travis doing anything like that,"" Gates said.She added that the last time she heard from her son was a few days ago when he called to tell her he was headed back to his base in Fort Bliss, according to the outlet. ""I'm so proud of him. I just want him to come home, come back to America,"" Gates said. Meanwhile, it is still unclear whether King planned his escape into North Korea or whether it was something he did on a whim. Some experts say that the trip just to the Demilitarized Zone takes days of planning.Jacco Zwetsloot, the host of the North Korea News podcast and a former employee of a tour company that took U.S. soldiers to the border, told the BBC that there was ""no way this person could escape from the airport one day and book on to one of these tours the next.""He told the outlet that these trips usually take three days to plan and tour-goers must submit their passports and other credentials to authorities.Can U.S. officials bring King home? The soldier's detention poses a fresh diplomatic challenge for Washington's wary relationship with North Korea; the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. NPR's Greg Myre said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may endeavor to leverage the incident for political gain.""It certainly wouldn't be surprising if North Korea tries to score some propaganda points or makes demands in exchange for handing over the soldier,"" Myre told All Things Considered. Many U.S. citizens have been detained by North Korea over the years. The last time was in 2018 when Bruce Byron Lowrance​ illegally entered the country from China. Lowrance was held in custody for a month before his release.Before that, Tony Kim, a Korean-American professor, and Kim Hack Song, a former South Korean politician who also held U.S. citizenship, were both detained in 2017 and then released over a year later. Their release came on the same day as another American Kim Dong Chul, who had been held since 2015. The three were set free during a visit North Korea by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and ahead of the much anticipated summit between then-President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore later that year.One of the more high-profile detainments was that of Otto Warmbier in 2016, a U.S. college student who was on a tour of the country before he was detained. Warmbier was accused of taking a poster from his hotel and held for more than a year. He was eventually released to U.S. officials while he was in a coma and then died just days after returning to the U.S.NPR's Emily Olson contributed to this story.

Katherine Clark says.","Members of Congress from Massachusetts are calling for federal action to overhaul gun laws in the wake of a deadly shooting at a Texas outlet mall over the weekend. A gunman authorities identified as Mauricio Garcia killed eight people and wounded seven others in Allen, Texas on Saturday afternoon, before he was killed by police. On Sunday, President Joe Biden asked Congress to send him ""a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers.""""I will sign it immediately,"" Biden said in a statement. ""We need nothing less to keep our streets safe.""Some members of Massachusetts' all-Democrat Congressional delegation are also asking for their colleagues to act.Rep. Katherine Clark of Revere, the U.S. House's second-ranking Democrat, posted the findings of a recent Fox News poll to Twitter, writing: ""Americans agree: enough is enough. Republicans in Congress must stop the obstruction and support reforms that will save lives.""The nationwide poll of 1,004 registered voters, conducted from April 21-24, found high levels of support for a variety of gun control measures, including requiring background checks on all gun buyers (87%), improving enforcement of existing gun laws (81%), raising the legal gun-buying age to 21 (81%), requiring mental-health checks on gun-buyers and allowing police to take guns from those considered a danger to themselves or others (80% each), and requiring a 30-day waiting period on all gun purchases (77%).Six in 10 survey respondents backed bans on assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. The poll tracked a deep partisan divide on assault weapon bans, with 84 percent of Democrats but only 36 percent of Republicans in support. The state’s two U.S. senators issued their own calls for action, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren saying both Congress and the Biden administration should “do more to pass and enforce robust gun violence prevention laws.” Sen. Ed Markey said Congress “has an obligation to act.”“Americans aren’t able to mourn the victims of one mass shooting before another occurs. It’s devastating—but it’s preventable,” Markey wrote. U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan posed the question, “How many more children and families need to be murdered at the hands of a gunman before serious action is taken to stop gun violence?”A Trahan spokesperson said the Westford Democrat “supports outlawing high capacity magazines and renewing the 1994 assault weapons ban that was effective in reducing the rate of mass shootings, requiring universal background checks on every firearm purchase so guns aren’t falling into the hands of people who shouldn’t have them, and closing the Charleston loophole so no one gets a gun before a full background check is completed.” Assault weapons are banned in Massachusetts under a 1998 state law, and former Gov. Charlie Baker in 2018 signed an ""extreme risk protection order"" law that lets family members petition the courts to temporarily suspend the gun ownership rights of someone deemed to be a danger. Further state-level action on gun laws is possible this session. When the two-year term began in January, House Speaker Ron Mariano said he wants to work on further strengthening Massachusetts gun laws. State Rep. Michael Day, a Stoneham Democrat who serves as House chair of the Judiciary Committee, launched a listening tour to hear from members of the public on various aspects of firearm safety and regulation, including so-called ""ghost guns"" — untraceable weapons built at home — school shooting prevention, hunting, and community impacts.

But a GBH analysis of data from the T shows that ridership more than doubled between the week of Feb. 15, 2021, before the program started, and the same week this year. Ridership on these lines is also up about 16 percent from before the pandemic, unlike other MBTA bus lines, where ridership is about 21 percent lower systemwide compared to mid-February 2020. Stacy Thompson, executive director of the transit advocacy group Livable Streets, said it isn't just the number of riders that shows the fare-free pilot has been a success so far. ""I think what's so exciting about this is that it doesn't look all that different. But for the people who are using free buses, it feels very different,"" Thompson said. ""And what that means is that when it is pouring rain outside, when it's snowing, you can get on the bus faster; the bus moves faster; there's more money in your pocket if you're not making a transfer and that's your only ride."" The MBTA is not the first transit system in Massachusetts to test out fare-free buses. All buses though the Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority and the Worcester Regional Transit Authority remain fare-free as well. ""There's a lot of focus on Boston, but we actually have regional transit authorities that are doing this work and seeing similar very positive results,"" Thompson said. Thompson said she often hears people question why buses should be free for all. Why not try free fares for low-income riders only? Free bus rides do more than save people $1.70 on their fare, she said. They save them time. ""Time is money,"" she said. ""On the MBTA system in particular, they help the buses move more efficiently. They take that friction away for the bus operators. We spend so much time, energy and attention and just trying to collect money that we have to look at those tradeoffs.""Thompson said she hopes the fare-free pilot program helps people readjust their thinking about how the MBTA at large could operate.""We hear people say 'folks have to pay for transit to care about it, we need fares to pay for transit,'"" she said. ""And then when the data shows that those fares aren't very reliable in terms of paying for our systems, that we actually get more people on the service, and they enjoy the service more when the service is free — it freaks them out a little bit, because the data is not affirming what their assumptions are about transit.""She compared transit to other services Americans think of as public goods, like libraries and schools: Mostly taxpayer-funded and free to use. ""The data saying going to a fare-free system makes good economic sense,"" Thompson said. ""These are political choices. Because at the end of the day, to have a world-class transit system from every corner of the state, we need greater investment.""The fare-free experiments, she said, ""have demonstrated the proof of concept."" As of now, the fare free pilot is set to go through February of next year in Boston.",Local,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 11:19:25 EST",6a165edfd81d040fba8976ed58061bb3

Healey says she’s “focused on affordability” to keep people from moving away.,"Gov. Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state’s future, saying she sees a “big need” to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families. Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state’s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states. “We need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,” Healey said. As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up. Healey’s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey’s tax package — a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million — earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.""By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor’s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state’s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,"" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement. In an interview later Thursday on GBH’s Boston Public Radio, Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts’ tax policy more in line with other states. “Only 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, … we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,” Healey said. “But honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state. She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year. Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance. In other budget matters, Healey said she’s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education. She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. “We need to do everything we can to get rid of them,” Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country. Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people’s voices to the table and that she “might even have a youth council of my own” at some point. She said she’ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected.",Politics,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:35:58 EST",6482378a56e852ea0dcbe9719535ac27

A new study published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looked at some 60 years of baseball data and daily temperatures, finding that air made thinner by warmer conditions accounted for 1% of home runs on average from 2010-2019.That small share is expected to grow to up to 10% by the year 2100 as temperatures climb over the course of this century — making the baseball diamond a kind of prism into the many ways our lives will be impacted by a changing climate, from recreation to health to civic infrastructure.""Climate change is not just heat waves or hurricanes,"" explains Christopher Callahan, a climate science PhD student at Dartmouth College. ""It's these subtle changes in our leisure activities that are going to start affecting people more and more in ways that we may not realize yet.""From sports commentary to science The idea that home runs could be enhanced by global warming has been batted around for a few years. In April 2012, baseball commentator Tim McCarver said this on television:""I think ultimately it will be proven that the air is thinner now, there have been climatic changes over the last 50 years in the world. And I think that's one of the reasons that balls are carrying much better now than I remember. The ball that Ramirez hit out, the ball that Freese hit out, I didn't think either one was going to be a home run, and yet they made it.""That observation did not play well with all viewers.""He got savaged for this,"" Callahan says. ""He was widely mocked for making this statement on air. People being like, 'Ha ha ha, this can't possibly be climate change.'""Callahan is a die-hard Cubs fan. He grew up within walking distance of Wrigley Field and his dad hooked him on the game at a young age.""You don't know why it's embedded in your soul in the way that it is,"" he says, ""but I'm never gonna be able to get it out.""McCarver's on-air comment also generated a few articles that did some back-of-the-envelope calculations — and found that maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched after all.""I had read some of those and said, 'Hey, look, we could try and find this in the actual data,'"" Callahan recalls. ""We could take the scientific methods that [I use] for my other work and bring them to bear on this issue.""And if there's one thing that Major League Baseball has, it's mountains of data. That includes home run counts for every player on every team going back decades — the kinds of figures emblazoned on baseball cards.Callahan considered the number of home runs from 114,417 MLB games over 60 years, combined with temperature data. They looked specifically at the days that were unseasonably warm and cold for the time of year. ""Instead of saying, 'Is it warm or cold?,' we say, 'Is it unseasonably warm for that location at that time?'"" he says. This is a question that's independent of other, potentially confounding factors like what the bat's made of, alterations to baseball stitching, or whether players were doping.Then, Callahan says, they asked: ""Are there unusually more home runs than there are normally?""The answer, according to their analysis, is yes. An 'intuition' for the physics of the game Scientists say they have a pretty good idea of why balmier temps seem to add a little extra juice to home runs.""Warmer air is less dense than cooler air,"" says Justin Mankin, a climate scientist at Dartmouth who worked with Callahan. This means there's ""more space between the air molecules, and so a ball is just going to encounter less air resistance and it's going to fly farther.""Michael Mann, the director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media, wasn't involved in the research. He says the analysis was solid but suggests that heat stress may be another way to explain the phenomenon that the researchers observed.Hotter temperatures may take a higher toll on pitchers, who have to throw a ball at high speed over and over, Mann explains.""But a hitter just has to get up there once and hit the ball and then they're done for a while,"" Mann says. ""And so hitters have more of an advantage over pitchers.""The thinking goes that on warmer-than-usual days, wearier pitchers would allow batters to hit more home runs. But that's where a second dataset steps up to the plate: Statcast.Statcast is a system that uses a set of high-speed, high-accuracy cameras to track baseballs and players throughout the game.Since being installed at MLB stadiums in 2015, this system ""has been used to track individual baseballs coming off the bat in really high-resolution ways,"" says Callahan.Take this clip from a Yankees home game against the Cubs last June. After Giancarlo Stanton sends a ball flying, the announcer shouts, ""That is a missile! And it's two-nothing, Yankees. I know we're gonna get the stats on this. That's one of the fastest home runs I've seen here at Yankee stadium.""Within seconds, the exiting velocity of Stanton's homer appears on screen — 119.8 miles per hour. This measurement is courtesy of Statcast. ""So we have the launch speed and launch angle of individual baseballs coming off the bat,"" explains Callahan.And at this point, all the other factors — including pitcher fatigue — don't matter. All that matters is the speed and angle of a ball at the moment that it's hit. Callahan compared 223,337 Statcast measurements from a five-year span to see whether air temperature had a measurable effect.And sure enough, ""we can say that the same ball leaving the same bat ends up being a home run more often in warm conditions,"" says Callahan, due to reduced air density. As for Tim McCarver, these results have ""vindicated his perspective that climate change plays a role,"" Callahan says. Mankin agrees. ""McCarver clearly had an intuition for all aspects of the game,"" says Mankin, ""including its physics."" The sports analyst died this past February, less than two months before the findings were published. Will baseball have to adapt to climate change? Callahan says that since 2010, more than 500 home runs can be chalked up to warmer temperatures. And he says that if things continue to heat up, by 2100 we're likely to see several hundred more home runs per baseball season.Andrew Solow, Senior Scientist Emeritus at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, says the new research makes a good case for the connection between warming and more home runs.Still, he added, ""there are some technical issues that would need to be addressed before I would be really confident that they're right.""Marshall Shepherd, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Georgia who wasn't involved in the research, says that this is just one study, and he'd like to see more work confirm these new findings before jumping to any sweeping conclusions. But the research looks sound, he says — and if it holds up, it has broader implications.""It's more than just the novelty of baseballs traveling further and more home runs,"" says Shepherd. ""I think it does raise a caution flag about the health and safety of both players and fans at these games.""A couple possible fixes may help bring stadium temperatures down. ""Maybe you want to consider a dome,"" says Mankin, ""or maybe you want to consider overturning ordinances to allow day games to be played at night.""He adds that revealing this connection between home runs and temperature deviations was only possible because of the vast amounts of data that the MLB collects.""Baseball is obsessed with itself,"" says Callahan. ""It's obsessed with collecting data on itself.""And this suggests, says Mankin, that these kinds of impacts are lurking everywhere, if we could only measure them.""What these results make clear is that climate change is fundamentally going to restructure our lives and livelihoods and recreation and well-being,"" Mankin says. ""Nothing escapes its touch."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:53:00 EST",88dc86bd381855ed3edfd68f79352169
743,"As Massachusetts weighs physician-assisted death, a California reporter explains her state's rollout",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/15/as-massachusetts-weighs-physician-assisted-death-a-california-reporter-explains-her-states-rollout,California legalized medically assisted suicide in 2016 under then-Gov. Jerry Brown.,"Earlier this month, new polling showed that nearly three out of four voters in Massachusetts support a bill that would allow terminally ill adults the option to be given life-ending medication. Should legislation advance in the State House, Massachusetts would join the 10 states and Washington, D.C. that have already legalized physician-assisted death.One of those states is California, where the legislation passed and was signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016. Health reporter April Dembosky of California’s KQED station covering the Bay Area joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the rollout of physician-assisted death in California. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: There are a few different terms and euphemisms for the process: medical aid in dying, physician-assisted suicide, the right to die, to name a few. You’ve written about these euphemisms. What is the evolution of it? Is it all about just moving away from the term ""suicide""?April Dembosky: It’s interesting. I covered the debates around this bill throughout the time that it was moving through the Legislature. And throughout that time, I was actually lobbied by people on both sides about what terms to use. At the time, in California, we started out referring to the practice as assisted suicide because that was the term that people knew and because this was the style that was recommended by the Associated Press. But during that time, proponents really argued that that term was not accurate. They said, you know, suicide refers to someone who wants to die, whereas people who were seeking this kind of care wanted to live but were already dying, and the process was about hastening their death, not causing it. At the same time, the terms that proponents were using tended to be jargony or, as you said, euphemistic. They were difficult to grasp. You know, especially back then — aid in dying, death with dignity — people didn't really understand exactly what those terms meant. What we ended up doing was we ended up trying to avoid using either side's preferred language. We would just try to put the law in context and say, this is a law that allows terminally ill people to take lethal medication to hasten their death. I will say once the bill became law here, we did become a little bit more sympathetic to the proponents and started to veer away from using terms like assisted suicide, although I do believe that is still the official term used by the AP.Rath: Tell us about how the process has worked as it’s been rolled out over the last several years.Dembosky: The first thing to say is that since this became law, not a lot of people have actually taken advantage of it. In the last three years, our state data shows that less than 500 people a year will take these lethal medications to end their lives.Rath: For a state the size of California, that’s not a lot of people.Dembosky: It is .001% of the number of people who die in California every year. So it’s a very, very small number. Part of this is because a lot of people aren’t interested, or a lot of people don’t know about it. But especially in the earlier years, there was also an issue with being able to find a doctor who was willing and trained to provide this kind of service. So even people who didn't know about it and wanted to take advantage of it couldn't necessarily find someone to help them. Our law in California was quite clear that this is optional, that no doctor has to do it if they have objections to it. So, for example, all of the Catholic systems in our state actually forbid their doctors from participating. But other large health care systems, like Kaiser Permanente and Sutter, started programs where they started to reach out to physicians to find out who was interested. And then they started to do training and education so that they would understand all the protocols and science around the medication. We also had a nonprofit group that began a centralized referral system. It's called the American Clinicians Academy on Medical Aid in Dying. Patients can go to this website, fill out an intake form, and if they qualify, they'll be matched with a doctor near them who's willing to provide the service.Rath: So overall, on the patient’s side, for people who do want to pursue that option, how difficult is it to go through legally?Dembosky: It's interesting that you phrase it as difficult, because I think some of the early adopters, if you will, who did try to take advantage of this law made complaints that it was too difficult. I think if you were to ask some of the opponents of the bill, that was, by design, there was really fierce debate around this bill. Most of the opposition came from disability rights advocates who feared that there would be coercion, that people who were living with disabilities might be pressured by their family members or even by doctors to give up on life-saving care that was perhaps expensive and choose this option to end their lives. The people who were pushing the bill really listened to these concerns and worked a lot of safeguards into the bill. For example, two doctors have to verify that the person has a terminal illness and has six months or less to live. The patient has to request the medication three times before they can get it, and one of those times has to be in writing. And then there's also a waiting period of 15 days between the first two requests. One of the early studies that was done around the practice actually found that close to a quarter of the people who wanted this medication were actually dying during that 15-day waiting period and were unable to have the deaths that they had hoped for. Rath: Obviously, this being applied disproportionately to the disabled or to the elderly or to people who might be poorer or other kinds of disadvantaged communities is kind of a nightmare scenario that people who are opposed to these laws tended to lay out. How much are those other fears coming into play?Dembosky: The data we have from California shows that these fears or assertions are not actually being borne out. I would say from a demographic perspective, physician-assisted death or aid in dying has been largely a white enterprise. To date, 87% of people who have taken these medications in California are white. Overwhelmingly, they are highly educated, having at least some college education, if not a college or a graduate degree. The vast majority of people who take the medication take it for a terminal illness like cancer, so 70% of people who have taken it have some kind of cancer. After that, it's 11% that have a neurological disease like ALS or Parkinson's. And then after that, it's heart disease or respiratory disease. We're also not seeing some of the fears around people with disabilities. So we don't know what percentage of people who have taken the drug have a non-terminal disability. But what we do know is that if they took the drug, it's most likely because they also had a terminal illness, most likely cancer. Rath: I’m wondering if, on the other side, if those disparities reflect, say, people of color or people who are economically disadvantaged are not getting as much access to these services or maybe other aspects about why they’re not opting in?Dembosky: The proponents of this practice would certainly argue that that is the case. They would say there hasn’t been enough outreach to let people know that this is available.",National,"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:58:17 EST",637206047a0a2221887bd661c2bd424b

Maura Healey dives in to the business of governing the Commonwealth, we want to know if her agenda lines up with your own.","Gov. Maura Healey’s first several weeks in office have been a time of foundation-building: putting together her team, reintroducing herself to top lawmakers, and publicly setting the goals that will define her tenure as she leads Massachusetts. She has sketched out a first-term agenda that keys on pressing issues facing the state, like the hefty price tags for housing and child care and the threats of climate change. As a candidate and now in office, “affordability” has been a common refrain for Healey. With her blueprints drawn up, the questions now become how she’ll deliver, and how her priorities match up with those of her constituents.Healey wants to tackle housing costs that make it too expensive for renters and homeowners alike to live in Massachusetts. She plans to name a housing secretary, turn unused state land into new housing, expand deductions for renters and help first-time homebuyers.She also aims to make sure education is accessible, and see that young people have the mental health care, food security and other resources they need to thrive. Her education agenda aligns with her goal of easing pervasive, economy-wide workforce shortages. To help workers learn the skills employers are looking for, she wants to make community college free for adults over 25 without degrees. Healey also promised the plan to fund the free community college program in the state budget she'll file next month, which will also include money for 1,000 extra workers focused on MBTA operations. The safety of the T — and its basic ability to function like it's supposed to — is another area the governor's zeroed in on, along with securing federal funding to help fix dilapidated roads and bridges across the state. As governor, Healey established climate as a focal point early on, adding a climate chief to her Cabinet on her first full day office. She wants to bet big on climate technology, research, innovating and manufacturing, and create jobs in the process. However, the overall cost of living is the key issue for Healey and other elected leaders, according to MassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela. He said more people think Massachusetts is headed in the right direction than not, but he sees some consistent concerns show up in his organization’s surveys. “Cost of living is right up there,” Koczela said. “It’s expressed in different ways. It's the cost of health care, it's inflation, it's the cost of living in general. All of those kind of tie back to the same thing.""This aligns with voter sentiment in a UMass Amherst poll in Massachusetts at the tail end of the 2022 campaign, in which people said they wanted the next governor to address inflation as well as the supply and affordability of housing. Tatishe Nteta, a UMass Amherst political science professor and director of the UMass poll, said this is a time when new governors typically seek to harness their public support to make progress on their major goals.“This is where leaders step up and articulate their vision for the future of the state, and the question is, is she going to do that or is it just going to be reactive to the problems that we have been dealing with, whether that’s the MBTA or issues of housing, the overarching issues or transportation and economic issues,” Nteta said. “Is she going to be proactive and visionary? Or is she just going to be reactive and managerial?”The actions Healey and her team take next will reverberate statewide, but they’ll feel different depending on where you are. Transportation needs differ in North Adams and Boston; the housing markets aren’t the same in Provincetown and Springfield. Follow our stories for the next several weeks and learn more as we work with reporters across the state to take a closer look at what the people of Massachusetts have to say about Gov. Maura Healey’s first agenda.SeparatorGBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis to return to their posts in the Tennessee state legislature, at least temporarily.The two former Democratic lawmakers, who were expelled by Republican colleagues after they staged a protest on the House floor calling for gun law reforms, say they want their seats back. Jones and Pearson, both of whom are Black, were voted out of the Tennessee House on Thursday for their actions that took place in response to the deadly school shooting in Nashville. Some 130,000 voters in heavily Black districts are currently without representation in the House. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, who is white and also led the protest, survived expulsion by one vote. Jones and Pearson voiced their desire to return to their seats as lawmakers in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. ""We will continue to fight for our constituents,"" Jones said.""This attack against us is hurting all people in our state,"" he added. ""Even though it is disproportionately impacting Black and brown communities, this is hurting poor white people ... silencing them.""Pearson told NPR's All Things Considered on Saturday that he hoped to return to the legislature. He said he and Jones were stripped of their positions because they ""decided that it was time for the state of Tennessee Republicans to stop listening to the NRA and start listening to the thousands of children and teens and grandmothers and siblings who are mourning because of the effects of gun violence."" Republicans said the expelled lawmakers disrupted order and broke procedural rules in the chamber.Local officials' meetings this week could appoint both as interim replacements for the empty seatsThe vacancies of both expelled lawmakers may be short-lived. Nashville Vice Mayor Jim Shulman has called for a special Metropolitan Council meeting on Monday to discuss filling the empty District 52 House seat left by Jones, according to an email tweeted out by councilmember Bob Mendes.If the council chooses to do so, it could vote to appoint an interim successor as soon as Monday night, Shulman told Axios. The majority of Nashville's 40-member council have already vowed to reappoint Jones, according to NBC News — with some signaling their intention to do so before the council meeting was even called.After the council appoints an interim House representative nominee, the county will hold a special election — in which Jones is eligible to run — to carry out the term.Meanwhile, the board of commissioners for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, plans to consider reinstating Pearson.Chairman Mickell Lowery announced he was calling a special meeting on Wednesday afternoon to ""consider the action to reappoint Mr. Justin Pearson to his duly elected position to represent the citizens in District 86,"" local station Action News 5 reported.Chances appear to favor Pearson's return: Commissioner Erika Sugarmon told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that the former lawmaker has enough supporters sitting in the commission, which has a Democratic supermajority, to get him successfully reappointed.

On Monday, July 17, a special screening and Q&A at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline will be moderated by GBH president and CEO Susan Goldberg. Before the Russian siege started on Feb. 24, 2022, Chernov said he and his fellow journalists decided they would stay in the southeastern city to record the war. “We knew how important Mariupol would be for Russia to try to take over because they’ve been trying this since 2014,” Chernov said. The team of journalists worked alongside doctors and firefighters working to save people from rubble. “How could we think about leaving? ... Everyone was dedicated to survival and to helping people next to them. We just did our job,” he said. That job was to record violence and tragedies in real time. Having photos and videos is important to document potential war crimes. When there are no journalists, there’s a void in information, Chernov said. He cited the bombing of a theater in Mariupol, where close to 600 people were killed. “It took us months to ... try to reconstruct that event,” he said. The journalists only left the city when they no longer had means to work. When the hospital was occupied by Russian troops and the Red Cross location bombed, they had no place to charge their equipment batteries. The film shows the bodies of people in the streets and injured people in hospitals. Chernov has heard from viewers that his film is hard to watch — but that “these moments of hope are shining through.”“Yes, it is hard, it is heartbreaking,” he said. “But there is hope there, and there is a resilience, a resistance of Ukrainian people who survive nevertheless, regardless of their indiscriminate violence that is happening to them.” Hope comes from moments like the baby born in the middle of a war. Chernov said one of the doctors said to him that day, “We used to see only people dying in this hospital. So having a child born is just like a ray of light coming down from heaven to us.” Yet what’s captured in the film is just a fraction of what Chernov and others witnessed in Mariupol and across Ukraine. “Mariupol is just a tiny fraction of what has happened to Ukraine. Other cities have been destroyed with the same tactics of burned land. ... I still have a lot of regrets for not being able to capture everything,” he said. Aside from taking time to promote “20 Days in Mariupol,” he's been filming on the frontlines every day. “I can see so many things that just couldn’t be reported on — haven’t been reported on — because, well, because it’s just too overwhelming.” The film will eventually be broadcast on PBS and available on streaming services. Chernov said his goal is for as many people to see the film as possible, including his daughters, whom he spends time away from while reporting on the front lines. “They are too little to understand right now what is going on. But someday they will ask me, and I will just show them this film,” he said.",Local,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 16:27:07 EST",ac635cd760c20f6f6336735b9766abce
252,They performed with Bono and The Edge (after their parents told them who they are),https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/18/they-performed-with-bono-and-the-edge-after-their-parents-told-them-who-they-are,Or perhaps Bono and The Edge performed with them.,"Or perhaps Bono and The Edge performed with them. Who are they? A gaggle of D.C.'s most talented teens! The members of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts concert choir joined Bono and The Edge for their Tiny Desk performance. Kirsten Holmes and Jevon Skipper are both students at the arts-centered school in Washington, D.C, and received a call from their choir director about a month earlier with the opportunity to join the rock stars in performing. The two vocalists, who aspire to use their talents to dip into the worlds of gospel, opera and R&B music, agreed to the performance with a few other classmates and members of the choir. What's the big deal? It's a Tiny Desk! Enough said, right? The performance features four songs, including a version of ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of ""Walk On."" The performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender. Though that may not have immediately impressed Kirsten and Jevon as much as some others. The Gen Z duo admitted they weren't very familiar with the Irish crooners and their band. (I guess they never had to deal with the shock of an unsolicited album showing up on their iTunes one fateful morning in 2014.) What are they saying? On learning about Bono's existence: Kirsten: I had found out prior... but [because] my parents [know]. Jevon: Not even my parents. My dad. Because I know my dad was like, 'Look them up!' So I look them up, and I see they performed at the Super Bowl. I'm like, 'Oh, they must be like big news if they're performing at the Super Bowl.' Kirsten: We're youngins. You know, we are young, so we're still learning and stuff, but it's just a wow moment. On meeting Bono: Kirsten: [He was] really chill, like down down to earth. And I love how they weren't big headed, because I know how sometimes when you're in the presence of someone with a higher status, it could be really intimidating. And I didn't feel like any of us felt intimidation from them. It was just really like a learning experience. They were like, 'Well, what do you think will fit good in this part?' Jevon: One of our friends, by accident, didn't get the words right. So he accidentally sung the wrong thing. And Bono was like, 'Oh, wait, what did you do?' He was like, 'I like that, man.' It was fun. It was funny because we all knew it was an accident, but then we kind of went along with it and Bono liked it. So we just did it. On the joy of performing: Kirsten: It was amazing, really happy. I think my moment was just seeing the people's reaction, just to allow other people to feel the enjoyment of what we are gifted to do. And it was just really good. Javon: I guess I just like the feeling that I can make someone's day with the gift that God gave me. Ever since I was younger, I just loved singing for people and making people feel better and just encouraging people. So, what now?

3621,What’s at stake in the college affirmative action case before the Supreme Court?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/06/14/whats-at-stake-in-the-college-affirmative-action-case-before-the-supreme-court,A ruling could end 40 years of improved diversity on campuses,"The U.S. Supreme Court is poised to issue a historic ruling this month affecting how colleges consider race in admissions. Here's what you need to know about the decades-long debate over affirmative action and the potential effects of the court's decision.The case could upend 40 years of legal precedent and fundamentally alter the landscape of higher education by making race considerations in college admissions illegal.Decades ago, colleges began considering race as one factor among many in the admissions process as a way to help remediate past discrimination, including the effects of slavery. If the Supreme Court ends affirmative action and colleges curtail the consideration of race as a factor in admission, campuses could become far less racially diverse.In the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court ruled that racial quotas in admissions were unconstitutional. That decision came after Allan Bakke, a white student, was twice rejected from UC Davis’ medical program, leading him to challenge the constitutionality of its affirmative action program. In his majority decision supporting UC Davis, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, a Virginian nominated by President Richard Nixon, held out Harvard’s admissions program was an example of how race can properly be taken into account in college admissions.""Race is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity, but it is only one factor weighed competitively against a number of other factors deemed relevant,” Powell wrote. “Under such a system, each applicant is treated as an individual regardless of race and is considered in competition for each seat in the class.""Nine years ago, a group called Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard University. Led by Edward Blum, a conservative legal strategist and longtime critic of race-based admissions, the group claimed Harvard held Asian-American applicants to higher academic and personal standards in the admissions process.Harvard denied those charges, arguing that race is just one factor in its admissions criteria. Harvard also noted that its population of Asian-American students doubled from 15 to 30 percent in the last 20 years. No Asian American applicants took the stand to testify that they were denied admission to Harvard because of their race. The plaintiffs relied on statistical analysis and administrative notes in the margins that they claimed exhibited implicit bias.In 2019, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants. Students For Fair Admissions disagreed. The group appealed the judge’s ruling and filed another lawsuit against the University of North Carolina. Those complaints have reached the Supreme Court.Last October, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and members of the majority conservative court asked questions from the bench that were deeply skeptical of the educational value of racial diversity. Many experts now predict the court will strike down race-conscious admissions.Thomas is expected to issue the majority opinion on the case, which ironically benefitted students like him in the 1960s. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester through a program designed to make the campus more racially diverse.In his 2008 memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" Thomas said he felt stigmatized by affirmative action because his classmates at Holy Cross and later at Yale Law School viewed him as a beneficiary of the program and not as an accomplished student.Nine states already have bans against race-conscious college admissions: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington. Those states have seen a growing gap between the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American high school graduates compared to the percentage of those students enrolled in large public universities.After California voters enacted a statewide ban in 1996, Black enrollment at the University of California's most selective schools dropped dramatically. At U.C.L.A., the percentage of Black students fell by more than half, from 7% to about 4% within two years. Colleges have said they will continue their efforts to admit a racially diverse student body and even boost their recruitment efforts. Some civil rights activists have said that’s not enough, and have proposed adopting slave descent as a factor in admissions.Such an approach is akin to “legacy admissions,” under which the children of alumni get prioritized in admissions, advocates have said. “Affirmative action, when it started, was aimed at addressing and remedying the history of discrimination against Black Americans and trying to open up opportunities for them,” said Ted Shaw, director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina. “It would be correct to return to the roots of these efforts.""Critics have questioned that approach, saying it would leave out other marginalized racial and ethnic groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who could be affected by a potential ban.",Education,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 05:00:57 EST",41dd1045673074271a00f6a1ba205ed3

But prison records show that Chansley has been moved to a residential reentry management facility in Phoenix, where he is originally from, and is expected to be released on May 25. Chansley, also known as QAnon Shaman, became a notorious face for the Jan. 6 attack after storming into the Capitol bare-chested in a fur headdress with horns. According to the Justice Department, Chansley was among the first 30 rioters to breach the government building. Inside, he took pictures of himself on the dais of the Senate floor and sat in the seat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied an hour earlier, the Justice Department said. When a police officer asked him to leave, Chansley refused and called Pence a ""traitor."" He later left a note on the dais that read ""It's Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!"" Chansley was arrested a few days later and indicted on six charges, two of which were felonies. He ultimately struck a deal with the government and pleaded guilty to a single count of obstruction of an official proceeding. ""Men of honor admit when they're wrong. Not just publicly but to themselves,"" Chansley told the court in Nov. 2021. ""I was wrong for entering the Capitol. I have no excuse. No excuse whatsoever. The behavior is indefensible."" Chansley was a vocal believer of several conspiracy theories including QAnon, which claimed that there were nefarious Democratic actors involved in child-trafficking rings. A local media outlet, Arizona Central, described him as ""a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies."" Before his activism, Chansley said he worked in a group home for troubled youths and studied religion, philosophy, psychology and ceramics at Glendale Community College, according to The Washington Post. Navy Times said Chansley also served in the U.S. Navy in his late teens, between 2005 and 2007, as a supply clerk seaman apprentice. He earned several accolades during his service, including the National Defense Service Medal.More than 1,000 people have been charged for the Capitol riot — which caused ""the most wide-ranging investigation"" in the history of the Justice Department. About $2.6 billion have been allocated to U.S. attorneys, in part to support the Jan. 6 prosecutions. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 11:19:00 EST",8507c3b92d95c5351e122ffb9257b985

Dave Epstein breaks it down",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/11/what-really-is-a-100-year-flood-dave-epstein-breaks-it-down,Flooding in Vermont illustrates a point about how we talk about flood risks.,"Flood warnings are still in effect in Vermont as the state has experienced torrential downpours, rising rivers and streams and emergency evacuations of people stuck in their homes. No flood-related deaths or injuries had been reported in Vermont as of Tuesday morning, according to the Associated Press. But the amount of rain falling over a short period of time is certainly “super unusual,” GBH meteorologist Dave Epstein said.“We have not seen rainfall like this since Irene,” Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said, referencing 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more. It’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage. It’s the wave, the second wave and the third wave.” When talking about these weather events, people may use terms like “100-year flood.” That’s a term often used by insurance companies to determine how likely that amount of flooding is to occur, Epstein said. “It just gives you a percentage of, you know, it's a 1% chance this would happen, or a 1/10 of 1% chance that this would happen,” he said. “And when you start getting these events happening more frequently that are supposed to be a 1% chance, that's when we start to evoke things like part of the changing climate — that these events get closer and closer together.”For areas along rivers and streams, flood risks continue after the rain has stopped, Epstein said. “You get the amount of water that comes down into the streams,” he said. “The small streams, they peak first. But all that small stream water has got to go into the bigger stream. So it takes a little while for those streams to start peaking.”Water levels will likely peak Tuesday or Wednesday. That means people should exercise caution around them — and stay away from flooded areas, Epstein says.Materials from the Associated Press were used in this report.",Local,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 12:01:39 EST",4eeb7e5daf33a0cb5404033b4261e9ac

In 2012, Barzman and a second man, known as ""J.F.,"" began making the counterfeit artworks and selling them on eBay and through Barzman's auction business. ""[Barzman] and J.F. agreed to split the money that they made from selling the Fraudulent Paintings,"" the DOJ said. ""J.F. and [Barzman] created approximately 20-30 artworks by using various art materials to create colorful images on cardboard."" Barzman further admitted that he lied about where the paintings came from, and said he found them in a well-known screenwriter's storage unit, the DOJ said. The fake artwork Barzman sold passed through the art industry and made its way to an exhibit in the Orlando Museum of Art. ""Most of the featured works had, in fact, been created by [Barzman] and J.F.,"" Barzman said in his plea agreement.The FBI seized 25 of the counterfeit pieces from the museum in June 2022, though in interviews in August and October 2022, Barzman said he did not make the paintings.

2089,Why car prices are still so high — and why they are unlikely to fall anytime soon,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/18/why-car-prices-are-still-so-high-and-why-they-are-unlikely-to-fall-anytime-soon,It has been nearly three years since auto plants around the world started to shut down because of the pandemic.,"It has been nearly three years since auto plants around the world started to shut down because of the pandemic.Yet between the pandemic, an acute shortage of semiconductors and other supply chain snarls, vehicle production has never really returned to normal.And prices? Hoo boy.Both new and used prices have stopped skyrocketing. In fact, both dipped slightly in February.But the average new-vehicle transaction price is still $48,763, according to Kelley Blue Book. Before the pandemic, the average new vehicle sold for $37,876.At an auto show this year, Noah and India Grabisch of Laurel, Md., were looking at new SUVs, which they liked. But an $86,000 price tag for a Chevrolet Suburban?Well ...""It looks nice,"" India Grabisch said. ""But ... no.""The used-car market doesn't provide much relief either. Retail used-vehicle prices now average $26,510.And after falling last year, closely watched wholesale prices, a key indicator of where markets are headed, are actually rising again.Why are prices remaining stubbornly high? Here are a few reasons.Supply chain woes are still reverberating The semiconductor shortage has gotten much better since 2021, but it hasn't gone away entirely, and other supply chain snarls continue to periodically disrupt output.Because of these supply chain problems, the global automotive industry has produced millions fewer vehicles than it would have otherwise.The supply of new vehicles is starting to improve, but those millions of ""missing"" vehicles are still gone. Lower supply, higher prices: It's basic economics.Which cars are being made? Not the cheap onesWhen automakers can't make as many vehicles as they would like, they prioritize their most profitable cars. Cheap ones get the boot.Consider what happened at Nissan, which continued to struggle with supply chain challenges throughout 2022. In response, it cut production of one of its cheapest cars, the Nissan Versa, by 78%. Nissan also reduced sales of two other cheap models, the Sentra and the Kicks.Bigger, slightly more expensive vehicles, like the Altima and the Pathfinder? Nissan boosted production of those.It wasn't because of a lack of buyers on the cheap end, says Judy Wheeler, Nissan U.S.'s vice president for sales and regional operations.""In the last month, we have seen search increase for the Nissan Versa, Sentra and Kicks, indicating a growing interest in this segment among consumers,"" she told NPR via email.She said Nissan intends to build more of those entry-level vehicles when the supply chain permits.It's not just Nissan. Across the board, automakers have been focusing on bigger, more luxurious, more expensive vehicles. And the ones they make also tend to be packed with extra features that bump up prices even more.Fewer cars — and higher prices — are very profitableThe shift in the market has been remarkable, and automakers are in no hurry to reverse course.Consider just how big the change has been. Cox Automotive crunched the numbers and found that from December 2017 to December 2022, sales of new cars under $25,000 — affordable, by new-car standards — dropped 78% and went from almost 13% of total new-vehicle sales to just under 4%.Sales of new cars over $60,000, meanwhile, skyrocketed. Those vehicles, costing more than the annual income of the average American, went from 8% of the auto market to 25% of sales.Because those $60,000 vehicles are significantly more profitable than the $25,000 ones, this shift is very, very lucrative for car companies. And they're especially focused on fat margins, instead of big volumes, because they're investing heavily in new electric vehicles (EVs).""The pricing environment that we're in right now has been very good, very robust,"" General Motors Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors on an earnings call last year. ""And ... running the business for cash flow is critical to help fund our journey in the EV transformation.""Yesterday's new cars are today's used cars ... Three years ago, when production lines started to slow, it affected both the new- and used-car markets immediately. Fewer new cars sent new prices up. That, in turn, pushed many shoppers into the used-car market. And more shoppers in the used market pushed prices up there, too.But the new-car woes also had a delayed effect on the used-car market — because new cars, obviously, become used cars after some time.So all those top-of-the line cars that were made in 2021 are now some very nice two-year-old cars, which means even in the used market, the high end of the market is booming.Meanwhile, because automakers cut production of cheap, no-frill sedans, people looking for cheaper late-model used cars are now out of luck.""We are firmly in the teeth of an extremely tight used-vehicle market, and that is directly a function of what has happened over the past three years,"" says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.Lonnie Smith, president of the nonprofit On the Road Lending, works to help working families get affordable loans for decent used cars, preferably those still under warranty.""Typically we're looking for vehicles that are two to four years old, less than 60,000 miles — a modest type of vehicle,"" he says.Those have gotten so hard to find lately that On the Road got licensed to be an auto dealer so it could buy vehicles at auction — the few cars that fit the bill on dealer lots were getting snapped up immediately.And the average loan for those cars, which was $13,000 ten years ago, has now risen to $24,000.Because, well, that's just the price of a modest used car in America these days.But there is some hope: EV prices could come downAs the chip shortage eases, automakers say they want to make more vehicles for people who can't afford top-of-the-line full-size SUVs. But don't expect a tsunami of $15,000 cars.""We're not really expecting to see, you know, this resurgence of inexpensive gasoline-powered vehicles,"" says Ed Kim, chief analyst at AutoPacific. ""Really where the industry is going is putting in a lot of effort to get more affordable plug-in vehicles out in the marketplace.""In fact, led by Tesla's aggressive price cuts, electric vehicle prices are dropping. According to the latest Kelley Blue Book data, they're down 7.5% year over year, and that's before federal tax credits (including for used vehicles).But there are daunting challenges — especially around charging infrastructure — before many car buyers will purchase an EV. And prices have a long way to fall before they're truly affordable. Investors were recently disappointed when Tesla, which has long promised a cheaper vehicle, did not unveil one.So cheaper vehicles are on the way. But many of them will be powered by batteries, and they'll take a long time to get here. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 05:00:00 EST",ad9e85cbf3dc13d2dd01eb4cd130577a

In 2018, the Camp Fire destroyed 11,000 homes and at one point, displaced nearly 50,000 people. In its aftermath, insurance companies saw huge losses, causing premiums to go up and toughening eligibility requirements to get covered.California officials have attempted to minimize such efforts, by temporarily barring insurers from dropping customers in areas hit by wildfires and directing insurance companies to provide discounts.But as wildfires rage on in the state, so has the issue of insurance affordability and availability. Last year, American International Group notified the state's insurance regulator that it will exit the homeowners market.

545,How Boston's bike mayor is making roads safer and more inclusive,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/08/01/how-bostons-bike-mayor-is-making-roads-safer-and-more-inclusive,Ortiz wants more people who look like her to get out and bike.,"Every day, Vivian Ortiz straps on her helmet, gets on her pink bike with purple pedals, and sets out on a quest to meet someone new.At bus stops, crosswalks, community meetings, bike trails, parks and streets all around the city, the Mattapan resident invites people into her world with an opening question: “Do you ride a bicycle?”Ortiz stands at 5-foot-4, with cat-eye glasses, a quick wit and a gravitational charisma strong enough to break through even the toughest New England façade.“People are in their own little world here, and that’s something that’s unique to the East Coast,” Ortiz said. “But people need to talk to people!""Ortiz is Boston’s first bicycle mayor — one of just five in the United States and more than 100 in the world, as named by Amsterdam-based biking advocacy organization BYCS. After establishing a reputation as a friendly and vocal advocate, local organizers nominated Ortiz for the volunteer position with the hope she could bridge the siloed factions of bicyclists. She says her role is about forming connections with neighbors, working to make streets safer in every neighborhood, and combating racial and gender inequality in the bike community. “If we want to make changes in the way that we travel and make sure that our planet is ready for our kids,"" Ortiz said, ""we need to show them that biking is joy.”Ortiz, a Black Puerto Rican woman who just celebrated her 60th birthday, cares deeply about recruiting older people, women and people of color into the biking community.“We still don't have enough people that look like me out there,” Ortiz said. “So many people think that people who look like me only ride bikes because we're poor. I am not what people traditionally think of when they imagine a person riding a bike.”For most of her life, Ortiz didn't even have a bike. But after moving to Boston and learning to ride in her 50s, it became her calling. “I found my people,” she said. “I’m here alone, and I’m very much a group person. I found new joy in riding my bike, and biking became my therapy.”Ortiz became bike mayor in the middle of an historic transition for the city, with former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh’s plan to transform bike infrastructure by 2030 already underway. Proposals to change city streets, take away parking and slow traffic have sparked controversy — inside and out of the bike community — especially in neighborhoods with limited access to public transportation. Ortiz finds herself as the conduit to bring people together, even when tensions rise.“Somehow, Vivian is so good at threading all of those communities into her web,” said MassBike Executive Director Galen Mook, who joined organizers from nonprofits Boston Cyclists Union and Livable Streets Alliance to nominate Ortiz for the position. “She keeps all of us together as a community, when arguably it is a little tribal sometimes.”Mayor Michelle Wu says she’s “very happy to share the title” of mayor with Ortiz, who she described as “a leading light” in a community that sometimes feels exclusionary. “When we make it safe, it is for everyone. It is the most liberating, affordable, easy way to get around,"" Wu said. ""Vivian helps everyone see that this should be their community, too.”This year, Wu rolled out free bike lessons and bikes for 300 children, created a $1.5 million rebate program for older adults and people with disabilities to purchase electric bikes. Wu also got to work adding 100 new Bluebikes stations and a 9.4-mile expansion to the city’s bike path network. But Wu’s bike lane extension plan doesn’t include much infrastructure in Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan — city neighborhoods with the highest populations of people of color, where residents bike at lower rates than other Boston neighborhoods. Bike infrastructure progress faces unique political, cultural and economic barriers, particularly in communities of color like Mattapan. “It’s a predominantly Black community, and that’s one of the reasons it’s neglected and no one is paying attention to what is happening here,” said Theresa Jordan, a Black female cyclist and advisory committee member at the Mattapan Food and Fitness Coalition. “But there’s a community of folks who raise their children here, they want safe neighborhoods and safe streets.""A proposal to build out bike lanes on Blue Hill Avenue has struggled with funding and received pushback from residents who have expressed concerns about safety, parking and the impact on small businesses in the area. In 2009, residents rejected a similar proposal after the plan was criticized for not taking in enough community feedback. Shavel'le Olivier, executive director at the Mattapan Food and Fitness Coalition and an organizer of an annual bike ride through Mattapan, says neighborhoods like Mattapan are often “last on the list” for city investments and resources. “When we do get resources, there is a lot of pushback,"" she said. ""The underlying issue is a lack of trust because a lot of residents are afraid that they’re going to get displaced.” Bike lanes are sometimes mocked as “white lanes,” symbols of gentrification and displacement. People of color are not represented in Boston’s bike community and largely see bicycling as “something that white people do,” according to one interviewee in a 2019 study by Tufts University. “We do need to do a better job to get more Black folks biking, and talk to Black folks about why they need to accept that we do bike, we’re out here,” Ortiz said. “We need to come together, because we need everyone that wants to be able to bike to have that space, the opportunity and the access.”Though Black and Latino populations represent the fastest-growing demographic of bicyclists across the country, the risks are much higher, largely due to a lower quality of cycling infrastructure: Black cyclists are 4.5 times more likely to die while biking than their white counterparts, according to researchers at Boston and Harvard universities.Since 2020, there have been 866 bike crashes and three fatalities in Boston, including one on Cummins Highway in Mattapan and another on the border of Roxbury and the South End, according to city data. In November 2020, a beloved retired Boston Public Schools principal Virginia “Jinny” Chalmers, age 70, was fatally struck by a utility truck while riding her bicycle in Milton. “Everybody knew Jinny and everybody loved Jinny,” Ortiz said. The news left Ortiz shaken: Chalmers was a community pillar and an older woman who rode her bike on Ortiz’s route., “The bike community reached out to me, afraid that it could have been me,” Ortiz said. “I thanked them for reaching out, but those people had families, too. It could have been any one of us. We have to acknowledge that there are still issues.” Though Ortiz mostly focuses on the joy of biking, she says there's so much more work to be done to prevent future tragedies. ""We that bike every day, we think, 'Am I going to make it home to tonight?'"" Ortiz said. ""That's the sad reality. But my job is to show people that biking is joy.""Mook, the MassBike executive director, said Ortiz was the obvious choice for bike mayor: someone who could talk to anyone, anywhere. “She hooks you, and it’s infectious,” Mook said. “Once you get Vivian, you’re stuck with Vivian, in a good way. There’s so much more that she wants to do with you, and she wants to see it through.” Ortiz grew up in El Paso, Texas, raised in a military family by parents who modeled community engagement in everything they did.“Every time we moved, it was: This is where we live. This is our community. Let's figure it out and see as much as we can,” Ortiz said. After Ortiz and her sister were called a racial slur by another student in their small-town Wisconsin school in the seventh grade, Ortiz’s mother gave a presentation to educate the class about the island of Puerto Rico.“She did it with each of our classrooms, and then it became an in-school assembly. So at least for that year in Wisconsin, those folks knew about Puerto Rico,” Ortiz said. “That was my parents’ response to everything: to teach and connect.”As a child, Ortiz and her two siblings didn’t bike much. The single banana bike they shared was lost somewhere between her father’s duty station transfers with the Army in the 1970s. The next time Ortiz tried to ride, she was 50, teetering on a rented bike on Martha’s Vineyard with no idea how to stop or change gears. Embarrassed by her own lack of knowledge and a very slow crash into a guardrail, Ortiz set her sights on a community she had never imagined as her own. “I thought everybody that rode a bike was like a white man, what we call a ‘MAMIL,’ a Middle-Aged Man in Lycra,” she said.Ortiz signed up for the city’s Women’s Learn to Ride program, a class taught by women and free for residents who identify as female or gender diverse.Starting with short rides around her block, Ortiz gradually began to build connections with other bicyclists at bike repair workshops and on group rides like the Boston Bike Party.On a heavy, beat up old Huffy, Ortiz biked the Midnight Marathon Bike Ride, an annual tradition that has drawn crowds of cyclists to ride along the Boston Marathon route on the night before the race. In 2016, Ortiz began attending the National Bike Summit in Washington, D.C., an annual event where advocates connect with their representatives. At her third summit, Ortiz received the Joyful Enthusiasm Award from the League of American Bicyclists, an honor acknowledging the spirit of fun she brought to her advocacy. In 2016, Ortiz became a spokesmodel for the Boston Public Health Commission's ""I Bike Boston!"" campaign to increase biking around the city, with Ortiz and her bicycle pictured on billboards and buses. An MBTA bus driver referred to her as ""That Bike Lady"" and Ortiz embraced the nickname. The next year, she became certified as a League Cycling Instructor. Blue Bikes, the city's public bike share system, gave Ortiz the ability to pull free bike passes and helmets for her students.Ortiz says she’s most proud of her Monday night rides, a tradition she has developed over the years to help her neighbors realize that “biking is something that is accessible for everyone in their own backyard.” Ortiz brought in some of her own bike mentors to help lead the group rides in Mattapan, Dorchester and Randolph on Monday evenings, cyclists who can lead the group if Ortiz needs to stay back with a slower participant. “They can go ahead and I can stay back, just like they did with me starting out,” Ortiz said. “Everything that I know about riding a bicycle is paying it forward, and everything I know about this community is because somebody told me. If we don't share that information, then what good is knowing it? It's for other folks to know as well, and I just hope that people start thinking that way.”Ortiz moved to Boston in 2009 for a job at Massachusetts Bay Community College, her first gig after completing a master’s degree in public administration in New York City. With no family or friends in her new city, Ortiz says the transition to Boston wasn’t easy. She struggled with depression and loneliness. Biking became an escape, a form of meditation and a way to connect with community in an increasingly isolated world.“I take meds, but riding my bicycle has really been a way for me to work through things,” Ortiz said. In 2017, Ortiz’s mother died, and two years later, she lost her father. Ortiz got on her bike and headed out for hours every night by herself, “just crying and having conversations” with the memory of her parents.When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, “I was terrified because I have no family here,” Ortiz said. After anxious calls with her sister, a school teacher in El Paso, Ortiz would get back on her bike, finding herself crying on a bench along the Neponset River.“If I did not have this bicycle, I don't know what I would have done,” Ortiz said. “I would be crying in my apartment.”In May 2022, Ortiz completed the Five Boro Bike Tour in New York City with that city’s local Bike Mayor Courtney Williams. But on her last night, while walking to get a slice of cheesecake from a nearby bakery, she tripped and fell, breaking her shin in eight places.“My doctor was like, you’re going to have to re-learn how to walk, and you’re not going to be able to ride a bike,” Ortiz said. “The middle child in me was like, 'OK, because you told me that, I don't think so.'”The following four months were spent between hospital wards and nursing homes, punctuated by intensive physical therapy focused on getting Ortiz back on her bike. While bedridden, Ortiz continued her advocacy, delivering biking resources, information and education to every nurse, doctor, intern and specialist she met.“There were times when I cried, sad times when I missed being on the bike and going outside, but the injury was not the thing,” Ortiz said. “It was not being around people that was really, really hard for me.”When Ortiz finally returned to Boston, a group of about 20 friends and neighbors — her “constituents” — organized a bike parade past her home. They held signs and swept their bike mayor off her feet for a ride along her beloved Neponset River in the back of a pedicab.“All I wanted to do was go on my bridge, and they came with a pedicab,” Ortiz said. “I don’t want to cry about it, but having that kind of community and support is just — wow.” Grecia White, a biking advocate and journalist who featured Ortiz in her documentary ""Women Who Bike at Night,"" remembers the look of joy on Ortiz’s face from the back seat of the bike taxi.“She was looking like a queen, she had this whole bike convoy,” White said. “You have to be very special to get people to come out for you like that.”Last fall, Ortiz got back on a Blue Bike and slowly began again, a little shakier this time with sustained nerve damage and a scar across her right leg. She’s now back up to 10 miles a day, and fully back in the swing of bike advocacy across the city. Last month, Ortiz joined White and other volunteers at the annual Women’s Learn to Ride in Mattapan, the class where she first discovered her calling.At the event, hands outstretched, Ortiz walked backward, offering guidance in both English and Spanish to East Boston resident Miriam Segura, a slightly older Latina woman who wobbled her way across the parking lot. “I’m so nervous that I'm going to fall,” Segura told her.“That’s why you come here,” Ortiz said. “Because this is the thing: I was like this nine years ago. We’re all in the same space, we’re all doing this together.”",Local,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 05:00:07 EST",cd9d7f8a5db3ed256c0cc53816cf7a48
2900,This company adopted AI.

Companies like OpenAI and Google have unveiled new Artificial Intelligence systems with incredible capabilities, making what once seemed like science fiction an everyday reality. It's an era that is posing big, existential questions for us all, about everything from literally the future of human existence to — more to the focus of Planet Money — the future of human work.""Things are changing so fast,"" says Erik Brynjolfsson, a leading, technology-focused economist based at Stanford University. Back in 2017, Brynjolfsson published a paper in one of the top academic journals, Science, which outlined the kind of work that he believed AI was capable of doing. It was called ""What Can Machine Learning Do? Workforce Implications."" Now, Brynjolfsson says, ""I have to update that paper dramatically given what's happened in the past year or two.""Sure, the current pace of change can feel dizzying and kinda scary. But Brynjolfsson is not catastrophizing. In fact, quite the opposite. He's earned a reputation as a ""techno-optimist."" And, recently at least, he has a real reason to be optimistic about what AI could mean for the economy. Last week, Brynjolfsson, together with MIT economists Danielle Li and Lindsey R. Raymond, released what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of the real-world economic effects of new AI systems. They looked at what happened to a company and its workers after it incorporated a version of ChatGPT, a popular interactive AI chatbot, into workflows.What the economists found offers potentially great news for the economy, at least in one dimension that is crucial to improving our living standards: AI caused a group of workers to become much more productive. Backed by AI, these workers were able to accomplish much more in less time, with greater customer satisfaction to boot. At the same time, however, the study also shines a spotlight on just how powerful AI is, how disruptive it might be, and suggests that this new, astonishing technology could have economic effects that change the shape of income inequality going forward.The Rise Of Cyborg Customer Service RepsThe story of this study starts a few years ago, when an unnamed Fortune 500 company — Brynjolfsson and his colleagues have not gotten permission to disclose its identity — decided to adopt an earlier version of OpenAI's ChatGPT. This AI system is an example of what computer scientists call ""generative AI"" and also a ""Large Language Model,"" systems that have crunched a ton of data — especially text — and learned word patterns that enable them to do things like answer questions and write instructions.This company provides other companies with administrative software. Think like programs that help businesses do accounting and logistics. A big part of this company's job is helping its customers, mostly small businesses, with technical support.The company's customer support agents are based primarily in the Philippines, but also the United States and other countries. And they spend their days helping small businesses tackle various kinds of technical problems with their software. Think like, ""Why am I getting this error message?"" or like, ""Help! I can't log in!"" Instead of talking to their customers on the phone, these customer service agents mostly communicate with them through online chat windows. These troubleshooting sessions can be quite long. The average conversation between the agents and customers lasts about 40 minutes. Agents need to know the ins and outs of their company's software, how to solve problems, and how to deal with sometimes irate customers. It's a stressful job, and there's high turnover. In the broader customer service industry, up to 60 percent of reps quit each year. Facing such high turnover rates, this software company was spending a lot of time and money training new staffers. And so, in late 2020, it decided to begin using an AI system to help its constantly churning customer support staff get better at their jobs faster. The company's goal was to improve the performance of their workers, not replace them. Now, when the agents look at their computer screens, they don't only see a chat window with their customers. They also see another chat window with an AI chatbot, which is there to help them more effectively assist customers in real time. It advises them on what to potentially write to customers and also provides them with links to internal company information to help them more quickly find solutions to their customers' technical problems.This interactive chatbot was trained by reading through a ton of previous conversations between reps and customers. It has recognized word patterns in these conversations, identifying key phrases and common problems facing customers and how to solve them. Because the company tracks which conversations leave its customers satisfied, the AI chatbot also knows formulas that often lead to success. Think, like, interactions that customers give a 5 star rating. ""I'm so sorry you're frustrated with error message 504. All you have to do is restart your computer and then press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT. Have a blessed day!""Equipped with this new AI system, the company's customer support representatives are now basically part human, part intelligent machine. Cyborg customer reps, if you will. Lucky for Brynjolfsson, his colleagues, and econ nerds like us at Planet Money, this software company gave the economists inside access to rigorously evaluate what happened when customer service agents were given assistance from intelligent machines. The economists examine the performance of over 5,000 agents, comparing the outcomes of old-school customer reps without AI against new, AI-enhanced cyborg customer reps.What Happened When This Company Adopts AIThe economists' big finding: after the software company adopted AI, the average customer support representative became, on average, 14 percent more productive. They were able to resolve more customer issues per hour. That's huge. The company's workforce is now much faster and more effective. They're also, apparently, happier. Turnover has gone down, especially among new hires.Not only that, the company's customers are more satisfied. They give higher ratings to support staff. They also generally seem to be nicer in their conversations and are less likely to ask to speak to an agent's supervisor.So, yeah, AI seems to really help improve the work of the company's employees. But what's even more interesting is that not all employees gained equally from using AI. It turns out that the company's more experienced, highly skilled customer support agents saw little or no benefit from using it. It was mainly the less experienced, lower-skilled customer service reps who saw big gains in their job performance. ""And what this system did was it took people with just two months of experience and had them performing at the level of people with six months of experience,"" Brynjolfsson says. ""So it got them up the learning curve a lot faster — and that led to very positive benefits for the company."" Brynjolfsson says these improvements make a lot of sense when you think about how the AI system works. The system has analyzed company records and learned from highly rated conversations between agents and customers. In effect, the AI chatbot is basically mimicking the company's top performers, who have experience on the job. And it's pushing newbies and low performers to act more like them. The machine has essentially figured out the recipe for the magic sauce that makes top performers so good at their jobs, and it's offering that recipe for the workers who are less good at their jobs.That's great news for the company and its customers, as well as the company's low performers, who are now better at their jobs. But, Brynjolfsson says, it also raises the question: should the company's top performers be getting paid even more? After all, they're now not only helping the customers they directly interact with. They're now also, indirectly, helping all the company's customers, by modeling what good interactions look like and providing vital source material for the AI.""It used to be that high-skilled workers would come up with a good answer and that would only help them and their customer,"" Brynjolfsson says. ""Now that good answer gets amplified and used by people throughout the organization."" The Big PictureWhile Brynjolfsson is cautious, noting that this is one company in one study, he also says one of his big takeaways is that AI could make our economy much more productive in the near future. And that's important. Productivity gains — doing more in less time — are a crucial component for rising living standards. After years of being disappointed by lackluster productivity growth, Brynjolfsson is excited by this possibility. Not only does AI seem to be delivering productivity gains, it seems to deliver them pretty fast. ""And the fact that we're getting some really significant benefits suggests that we could have some big benefits over the next few years or decades as these systems are more widely used,"" Brynjolfsson says. When machines take over more work and boost our productivity, Brynjolfsson says, that's generally a great thing. It means that society is getting richer, that the economic pie is getting larger. At the same time, Brynjolfsson says, there are no guarantees about how this pie will be distributed. Even when the pie gets bigger, there are people who could see their slice get smaller or even disappear. ""It's very clear that it's not automatic that the bigger pie is evenly shared by everybody,"" Brynjolfsson says. ""We have to put in place policies, whether it's in tax policy or the strategy of companies like this one, which make sure the gains are more widely shared."" Higher productivity is a really important finding. But what's probably most fascinating about this study is that it adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests that AI could have a much different effect on the labor market than previous waves of technological change. For the last few decades, we've seen a pattern that economists have called ""skill-biased technological change."" The basic idea is that so-called ""high-skill"" office workers have disproportionately benefited from the use of computers and the internet. Things like Microsoft Word and Excel, Google, and so on have made office workers and other high-paid professionals much better at their jobs. Meanwhile, however, so-called ""low-skill"" workers, who often work in the service industry, have not benefited as much from new technology. Even worse, this body of research finds, new technology killed many ""middle-skill"" jobs that once offered non-college-educated workers a shot at upward mobility and a comfortable living in the middle class. In this previous technological era, the jobs that were automated away were those that focused on doing repetitive, ""routine"" tasks. Tasks that you could provide a machine with explicit, step-by-step instructions how to do. It turned out that, even before AI, computer software was capable of doing a lot of secretarial work, data entry, bookkeeping, and other clerical tasks. And robots, meanwhile, were able to do many tasks in factories. This killed lots of middle class jobs. The MIT economist David Autor has long studied this phenomenon. He calls it ""job polarization"" and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class. Basically, the data suggests that the last few decades of technological change was a major contributor to increasing inequality. Technology has mostly boosted the incomes of college-educated and skilled workers while doing little for — and perhaps even hurting — the incomes of non-college-educated and low-skilled workers.Upside DownsideBut, what's interesting is, as Brynjolfsson notes, this new wave of technological change looks like it could be pretty different. You can see it in his new study. Instead of experienced and skilled workers benefiting mostly from AI technology, it's the opposite. It's the less experienced and less skilled workers who benefit the most. In this customer support center, AI improved the know-how and intelligence of those who were new at the job and those who were lower performers. It suggests that AI could benefit those who were left behind in the previous technological era. ""And that might be helpful in terms of closing some of the inequality that previous technologies actually helped amplify,"" Brynjolfsson says. So one benefit of intelligence machines is — maybe — they will improve the know-how and smarts of low performers, thereby reducing inequality. But — and Brynjolfsson seemed a bit skeptical about this — it's also possible that AI could lower the premium on being experienced, smart, or knowledgeable. If anybody off the street can now come in and — augmented by a machine — start doing work at a higher level, maybe the specialized skills and intelligence of people who were previously in the upper echelon become less valuable. So, yeah, AI could reduce inequality by bringing the bottom up. But it could also reduce inequality by bringing the top and middle down, essentially de-skilling a whole range of occupations, making them easier for anyone to do and thus lowering their wage premium. Of course, it's also possible that AI could end up increasing inequality even more. For one, it could make the Big AI companies, which own these powerful new systems, wildly rich. It could also empower business owners to replace more and more workers with intelligent machines. And it could kill jobs for all but the best of the best in various industries, who keep their jobs because maybe they're superstars or because maybe they have seniority. Then, with AI, these workers could become much more productive, and so their industries might need fewer of these types of jobs than before.The effects of AI, of course, are still very much being studied — and these systems are evolving fast — so this is all just speculation. But it does look like AI may have different effects than previous technologies, especially because machines are now more capable of doing ""non-routine"" tasks. Previously, as stated, it was only ""routine"" tasks that proved to be automatable. But, now, with AI, you don't have to program machines with specific instructions. They are much more capable of figuring out things on the fly. And this machine intelligence could upend much of the previous thinking on which kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. Next week, in the Planet Money newsletter, we speak with MIT's David Autor, who pioneered much of the economic thinking about technological change, automation, inequality, and upward mobility in the past few decades. What's he thinking now? Stay tuned! [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Tue, 02 May 2023 06:31:00 EST",c791ac94490ce14e3eed0b34848b14a1
4516,Boston’s original marathon bombing memorial lives a quiet afterlife in a West Roxbury archive,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/12/bostons-original-marathon-bombing-memorial-lives-a-quiet-afterlife-in-a-west-roxbury-archive,"The materials and mementos people dropped off are preserved for posterity, but the public is staying away.","In the days after the Boston Marathon bombings, people flocked to the scene of the attacks and left behind thousands of items as tokens of grief and solidarity, converting Boylston Street and then Copley Square into an impromptu shrine.Among the objects deposited was a green apron from a nearby Starbucks, covered with handwritten messages that showed people struggling to find an emotional path forward. “Forgive but never forget,” one message read. “Don’t let hate live in your heart. We are a strong and powerful city.”The attacks on the marathon have become an indelible part of Boston history, and two permanent markers now stand at the blast sites. But that apron, and the other items that were once part of the temporary memorial, have, in fact, been largely forgotten — even though they’ve been preserved in perpetuity and are accessible to the general public.A few weeks after the bombings, in June 2013, the temporary memorial was taken down. Since then, a huge swath of the objects that used to make up the memorial have been kept at the Boston City Archives in West Roxbury, a low-slung, nondescript building located near a Home Depot by Boston’s southwestern border.Here, stored in the archives’ cavernous records room, you can find almost all of the temporary memorial’s so-called flat objects, including drawings, cards, notes, flags, race bibs, police patches and whiteboards that bear greetings and condolences from Boston and much further away. Other, more unwieldy objects, including most of the running shoes emblazoned with messages that came to define the memorial, are stored offsite but can also be retrieved for public viewing.Recently, Marta Crilly, a city archivist, arrayed a selection of objects, including the Starbucks apron, in a small area for viewing by GBH News. She also discussed the emotional bond she and her colleagues have formed with the items over the years, and the drop-off she’s recently observed in public interest.Taking down the memorial a decade ago “was quite a surreal experience for us,” Crilly recalled. “Because we’re certainly used to bringing records into the archives, but we’re usually working with records [for which] there’s been a distance of time. And these were records documenting a historical event that we had all lived through, that had just happened a couple of weeks earlier.”Crilly said she’s still struck by the massive wave of sentiment these artifacts can convey a decade later.“Something that always jumps out to me is just the sheer volume of people ... who were moved to write a message,” she said. “The outpouring of support and solidarity felt overwhelming to me, as someone who is a Bostonian — and overwhelming in a good way, in a way that we felt very supported. Always, still, I feel kind of taken aback by it.”But Crilly and her colleagues have few occasions to access this material. In 2014, to mark the first anniversary of the attacks, the collection was used to create an exhibit at the Boston Public Library titled “Dear Boston: Messages from the Marathon Memorial.” Pieces have also been shared with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and several other institutions. In 2020, an exhibit was planned at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum before COVID-19 derailed it.Over the past decade, though, engagement by the general public has gone from limited to almost nonexistent. In that span, Crilly said, requests by the public to access the collection have dwindled from three to five annually to about one. The type of patron seeking access has shifted too, from what Crilly described as people with personal connections to the memorial to academic researchers.There are several possible explanations. Geographically, Boston’s archives are off the beaten path, which could deter some would-be visitors. Many people may not even know the materials exist and can be easily accessed. Also, the items in West Roxbury can be viewed almost effortlessly at a digital archive maintained by Northeastern University — though those pixelated equivalents lack the evocative power of their physical counterparts.But there’s another, deeper explanation at play, too.In 2013, when then-Mayor Tom Menino announced that the temporary memorial in Copley Square would be removed, he implied that it had been part of an early, raw stage of communal grieving that Boston was ready to leave behind.“It is my hope,” Menino wrote to survivors and victims’ families, “that the respectful closing of the temporary memorial will help us all look to the future.”Menino’s words pointed to questions that transcend Boston. In recent decades, in the United States and elsewhere, temporary memorials have become a ubiquitous response to events in which lives are lost and communities are traumatized, including terrorist attacks, police killings and mass shootings.Erika Doss, a professor of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame, has written on the topic. She says temporary memorials give the public a predictable, accessible way to engage tragedies that might otherwise seem intolerable. It’s a secular ritual, of sorts: participants bring physical offerings to the site of the trauma, scrutinize the objects left by others, take a picture or two, and watch as the memorial they helped create continues to grow. In the process, despair that might have been private and passive becomes public, communal and active.“I find it fascinating,” Doss said. “[It’s] a big change from, let’s say, the 1950s — the postwar period — when there is a much more constricted sense of what your emotional expression should be in the public sphere.”But then, time and again, the memorials come down. And at this point, Doss says, local officials face a huge challenge: As the use of temporary memorials has proliferated, so has a belief that the items they contained need to be preserved for posterity. It’s a belief she regards with skepticism.“We’re talking about filling up museums, archives, and collecting agencies with stuff like paper, artificial flowers, teddy bears that don’t look too great — stuff that just takes up space,” Doss said. “I’m not arguing that it’s not valuable. But I am questioning this imperative that we seem to have to save and preserve.”Boston, however, has already made the choice to save and preserve. And while some of items in the archives may feel dispensable today — for example, mass-produced placards that pair a brand name with the phrase “Boston Strong” — others can still pack an emotional punch.As I browsed through items left on Boylston Street in the bombings’ immediate aftermath, I was stopped cold by a note to Martin Richard, the youngest victim, from another child.“You had a lot to live for, you had anything to do with your life,” Richard’s correspondent wrote. “Now, you’re up in Heaven with God who will watch over you little guy!”Something about that piece — the childish script, the lurch from despair to optimism, the memory it triggered of Richard’s once-ubiquitous face — instantly made me feel like I was back in April 2013.Do items with that kind of power deserve to be seen by more people? After visiting the archives, I spoke with Rainey Tisdale, who led the effort by local cultural institutions to mark the bombings’ first anniversary and curated the “Dear Boston” exhibit at the library.When I asked if she thought bringing some of these materials back into the public eye would make sense in the future, she had a nuanced response. Displaying some of the items in a comparative context could be valuable, Tisdale said — for example, alongside similar memorials created elsewhere in the United States, or with different items that capture Bostonians’ response to other traumas. That approach, she said, could yield insights about “how, as humans, we grapple with the things that knock us sideways.”But Tisdale also said resurfacing parts of the temporary memorial in isolation would have less meaning.“If we go back to 2013, 2014 ... if you asked Bostonians then how they wanted to memorialize this event in the immediate aftermath, many of them would have told you, ‘We want the biggest memorial you’ve got,’” she said. “And similarly, many would have said, ‘We need this collection’” — the items from the temporary memorial — “‘to be on display where we can all see it easily, forever.’”And yet, Tisdale added, “It’s natural for those feelings to fade with time. So here we are, 10 years later — and if you ask Bostonians what they need today, I expect many of them would tell you they’ve moved on. And that’s okay.”From that vantage point, the prospect of the temporary memorial abiding in the archives while being forgotten by the general public feels less like a problem to be solved than a victory, albeit a partial and painful one.Crilly, the Boston city archivist, says that interest among academic researchers may continue growing in the decades to come. “In my experience,” she said, “it can take a couple of decades before people start writing their books, start writing their academic articles.”In the meantime, she and her colleagues stand ready to assist anyone looking to activate their memories of a time that, for many of us, feels increasingly far away.“They're public records,” Crilly said. “People are always welcome to come in. And we have a lot of open appointments.”",Local,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 05:00:59 EST",818a68fa31800cddeb6faa0bcbf5d58e

At the service center, we're adding about 45% more staff.”The new law allows eligible Massachusetts residents to apply to obtain a standard driver's license, regardless of immigration status, removing a previous state requirement that residents provide proof of immigration status. The law was passed after a contentious two decades of debate in the Legislature.“Between July and December, we expect that would have the greatest demand. So those increased staffing levels are here to help meet that,” Ogilvie said. The Registry of Motor Vehicles released a press release Wednesday detailing some of its plans with comments from various state officials, including Gov. Maura Healey. “The Work and Family Mobility Act is a benefit for public safety, for our economy, and for our immigrant residents who should be able to drive to work, school, or the grocery store without fear,” Healey said in a written statement. “We are grateful to the advocates, legislators and public safety leaders who have worked so hard to get us to this point.” A huge part of the undertaking is expanding language access in the Registry of Motor Vehicles as a whole. The office has been meeting weekly with a coalition, called Driving Families Forward, to hear from immigration advocates on how to improve services starting next month.Ogilvie says many new employees are multi-lingual and new phones are being installed in service centers to provide translations. “If we do have a customer that’s non-native English speaking, we can use the phone to call up an interpreter,” she said. There are 19 states with driver's license laws on the books for undocumented immigrants — Massachusetts was the 17th state to pass one. A GBH News investigation from 2019 found that, in Connecticut, a similar law is credited with a reduction in hit-and-run crashes. State Rep. Christine Barber, one of the lead sponsors of the law, told GBH News that providing language acccess is key to making the process a success. Barber has participated in many community group sessions with the public to let people know what to anticipate as the law rolls out. “People are really excited and just grateful that this is finally happening,” she said. “The goal is to get more people insured and licensed on our roads.”Intererested new drivers will need to make an appointment to come in, state officials said; no walk-ins are available. Starting July 1, appointments can be made at Mass.Gov/myRMV, and the office anticipates those filling up quickly. There is a special informational phone line currently available at 857-368-9362 with messaging about the law in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Haitian Creole and Vietnamese, with additional languages added soon. Driver’s license materials will be in 15 languages, permits in 35 and interpreters available in phone and in person in over 100 languages. The registrar’s office also is cautioning residents to be aware of fraud. Many nonprofits are reporting notary publics are advertising services where they stand in line for immigrants, expedite their applications and charge fees to let them know what documents are required. But that list is available for free online. “Customers needing credentials should never pay someone for an RMV appointment. There are no special brokers authorized to help you get an appointment or a license,"" state officials said in a press release. “Make sure that you pay fees only at Mass.Gov/myRMV or in person at an RMV location.” In advance of July 1, $9.2 million was budgeted for start-up costs for the law in fiscal year 2023, and of that total, $4 million was payroll-related. Hiring will continue in fiscal year 2024. The fiscal year 2024 budget authorizes the RMV to spend $28 million for the new law and is authorized to spend up to $32 million. “We feel that we have the support we need to be successful,” Ogilvie said.",Local,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 15:14:58 EST",7adef44196a6f82f6db9929c4f733219

Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, just to name a few. But why is it so important to have women in elected office, and what difference does their leadership make? Amanda Hunter, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, joined GBH’s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So what has the center's research shown about the opportunities for women who serve in elected offices and the challenges they face when they get there? Amanda Hunter: Well, one reason that my boss, Barbara Lee, started the foundation — which does nonpartisan research looking at the obstacles and opportunities women face when they seek elected office — is because she knew 25 years ago that having more women's voices at the table, and having more representation at the table in general, was going to strengthen our democracy. And that is exactly what we see both nationally and here in Massachusetts when you look at women's leadership, because women are what we call 360 degree leaders: they bring the entirety of their lived experience to the table. So when you look here in Massachusetts, if you look at our mayor of Boston, for example, Michelle Wu, coming off of the COVID-19 crisis, she had children attending Boston Public Schools. She was a stakeholder when they were trying to figure out the school bus transportation issue. And so she naturally would look at that problem very differently than maybe an older man who did not have children that were directly affected by the bus issue. Paris Alston: And to that point, I'm just thinking about the overturning of Roe v Wade last year. How is policy affected when women are in office, and when they're not at the table making those decisions? Hunter: Well, you're absolutely right, Paris. Our recent study showed that a majority of women voters, including Republicans, did think that the government should stay out of women's reproductive health decisions. That same study showed that women voters think that there should be more women in office, and they believe that women are better equipped to solve the problems that not just voters are facing, but that the country is facing. And we've seen for a number of years that generally voters believe that women are more in touch with ""kitchen table issues"" because regardless of what a woman's family looks like, Barbara always says women are the peacemakers. Women are doing the emotional labor. Women are doing a lot of the shopping. And voters internalize that. Siegel: There are a number of stereotypes and biases, many of them dangerous, that have fueled the outcomes of elections for a long time. Thinking back to the 2016 election and the aftermath of that, many people pointed to the fact that despite her qualifications for the office, Hillary Clinton was not elected in large part due to the fact that she is a woman. I'm curious: From your center, looking at people who are in office, women who are in office, how does society respond to the policies and the leadership that women have when they are elected? Do we sometimes fall into those same stereotypes in response to women who have been elected to office? Hunter: Well, Jeremy, unfortunately, voters still do. And we've found for 25 years in our research that when women run for office, voters don't assume that women are qualified. Women have to do much more. Men can simply release their resumé. Women have to really justify what they accomplished in each job. And so we just recently looked at how voters view incumbent women that are in office. And similarly, voters don't assume that incumbent women are doing a good job. So the burden is on women to overcommunicate their accomplishments when they are in office. And so much of this comes down to stereotypes, as you said. We often talk at the foundation about how a lot of voters still have what we call an ""imagination barrier"" when it comes to picturing women at the highest levels of office. And even though we've broken a lot of barriers here in Massachusetts, sometimes we still see women in leadership held to a different standard because they look different, they sound different, and they are blazing their own trail in the job. Alston: And in addition to those criticisms, I'm also thinking about the challenges they face among their colleagues when they get into office, right? Not only in terms of being undermined or discounted in many ways, but also being harassed. And thinking about our own state auditor, Diana DiZoglio, who says she was sexually harassed as a legislative aide and is opening an investigation into the nondisclosure agreements that currently exist and can keep those things hidden. So with that said, how much further do we still have to go to reach equality for these women in elected office? Hunter: We still have a long way to go. And even though we have a record number of women in elected office at all levels, both nationally at the congressional level and of course here statewide in Massachusetts, women are still largely underrepresented when you compare it to the percentage of men. In our state Legislature, women make up less than a third of the entire State House. And in a progressive state like Massachusetts, that may surprise some people. So in terms of equity, we still have a long way to go. But Auditor DiZoglio is a really great example of a woman who is bringing her lived experience to the job and addressing problems that maybe a man wouldn't think to even begin to address because her experience was so specific. And that's why it's so important to have a diversity of voices at the table. Siegel: What can and should be done to make things more equitable? And what can men who are in office do to better support their counterparts who are women or who are looking to get into office in the first place? Hunter: Well, there are so many things, Jeremy, because we see in our research all the time that voters, for example, scrutinize women's appearance, their voice, their hair, their clothing, in a way that they don't for men, a lot of times because there's a uniform of what men have worn in office for so long and women look differently. So I challenge not just men in elected office, but really all of us: When we hear our friends, our family, our colleagues making comments that sound like they have some gender bias, and racial bias in a lot of cases as well, that we challenge those comments and ask, ""Would you still say that same thing about a man?"" Because oftentimes the answer is no.",Politics,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 10:52:12 EST",c8e938e9f91d31c76df56003bb35619f

She explains that crabs are related to spiders — they’re arachnids.“Araña,” one of the students says, using the Spanish word for spider. “Do they just live in saltwater?”“Yes.”The four students — Aguilar, Alejandra Garcia, Yolanda Peñaloza, and Ireri Servín — traveled to the Cape earlier this month to learn about the massive restoration project on the Herring River in Wellfleet. They hoped to see how Cape Codders gathered community support — and how to inspire similar work on a heavily polluted lake back home.East Harbor is not part of the Herring River restoration the students traveled 3,000 miles to see. The East Harbor project is smaller, but it’s farther along.Fox said it gives the students a glimpse of how a species can return even with modest changes to the water system.“This is an area where we've been finding them thriving … and we're finding baby crabs,” she said. “And so it's a very positive story of a restoration where everything has recovered into a functioning system, which is what you hope for.”The students’ visit was a leadership-development trip through a summer camp where they’re graduating the internship program and joining the summer staff.Each year, the camp centers on an issue of community concern, and this year, it’s the badly degraded Lake Pátzcuaro, a body of water that covers more square miles than the Quabbin Reservoir.A member of the camp steering committee has friends on Cape Cod. That’s how the restoration of the Herring River became the foundation of a cultural exchange.While they were here, they got plenty of support from Seashore science chief Geoffrey Sanders and his staff, plus the Friends of the Herring River and the town of Wellfleet.They learned how Massachusetts’ largest-ever estuary repair took many people, working together for decades, to plan and fund the work.In a conversation with Seashore staff, the students talked about the problems of Lake Pátzcuaro and their goals for the future.Peñaloza, 20, who is studying medicine, said healing Lake Pátzcuaro requires community organizing.“We have four municipalities around the lake,” she said. “The sewage and the garbage goes to the lake. … So we want to know how to organize the four municipalities to work under one umbrella.”Aguilar, a business administration student, said the lake is also compromised by agricultural chemicals from the growing of avocados in the Lake Pátzcuaro basin.“People have cut down many of the last forests in the basin in order to plant avocados, which … need a lot of water and a lot of toxic chemicals,” she said. “And when it rains, the runoff sends all these chemicals into the lake.”Later in the day, the students visited Duck Harbor with Seashore staff. The low-lying land behind a bayside beach in Wellfleet is connected to the upper reaches of the Herring River, so it’s part of the project to restore tidal flow.As they looked out over the place where trees have died and salt marsh plants are returning, Restoration Ecologist Tim Smith told the students that Duck Harbor is also being inundated from the bay side by sea-level rise.“These plants … everything that’s green, which are just short, little stubby plants — they can handle being flooded every day, twice a day, by salt water,” he said.The study trip, organized by the Campamento de la Paz, or Peace Camp, caught the attention of Linda Bennett from the international affairs office of the National Park Service.She decided it was important enough to meet the students on the Cape.“I thought it was such a valuable program they were going to do here, to learn from the park, present their case, develop some solutions, and go back into their community in Mexico and actually apply them,” she said.And she said the Seashore benefits, too, by hearing about shared phenomena, such as invasive species, and making international connections.When the students returned home, they planned to meet with the mayor of Pátzcuaro to share what they’ve learned.They’re taking a stand, not only for their own futures, but also for civic activism to heal the lake they love.",Local,"Fri, 04 Aug 2023 05:00:20 EST",9598f0a163e7254b9d978487c14b6c65

Military and paramilitary forces are clashing under the orders of two prominent generals, with much of the fighting taking place in the country’s capital, Khartoum. Estimates put the number of deaths at more than 800 people, with thousands more injured and hundreds of thousands displaced. “This is a very sad situation. It affects us emotionally and physically. It’s so bad we lost people, we lost connection. It’s just like flashback. We lived this situation before. They have no food. The bullet is over their head. They are so scared. We have people without education, elderly people, disabled people, pregnant women, kids and all that is so much,” said Samia Komi, a Sudanese native who moved to Massachusetts in 2003. Komi expressed her feelings about the war in Sudan on Boston Public Radio Wednesday with her daughter, Omnia Fadelelsaid, and Amal Amon, who came to Massachusetts 23 years ago. A Sudanese civil war, from the 1980s up to 2005, prompted the women to leave. But leaving the country was not an easy choice. Family members stayed behind — Fadelelsaid said that, just on her mom’s side, more than 70 family members are still in the country. “For us, that is a lot and it carries a lot for us here because to hear what’s going on, because they’re in every part of the country,” she said.“I call my sister,” Amon said. “Sometimes the line is open, sometimes it’s off. Sometimes it’s really hard to call them and see how they’re doing and all those things. ... They’re putting their hope in God. They have a hard time with food and money and medicine.”She feels that the United States is not taking the war seriously. She recalled the conflict that she lived through, with the Second Sudanese Civil War still raging when she left the country more than two decades ago. “For my view, I don’t see anything being done,” she said. “War is not an easy thing. Even my life, when I grew up, I’ve been in the war. You have to run every day for your life. And I hope United States, they will look at it. ... We are suffering for many years. I hope they will help.” The United States announced Tuesday that it would be sending $245 million to Sudan and neighboring countries to “respond to the new needs arising from the current conflict.” “We want to speak out and make sure that the right voices hear us, especially here people in America. Whatever they can do,” Fadelelsaid added. “Even whoever is hearing us right now that is able to do something, to push, to put a little bit more pressure on the American government to get help, or put a little bit more pressure on our government to cease fire so all of the civilians can get relocated to an area that’s not a war zone. That is all we want right now.” Fadelelsaid has also started a campaign on GoFundMe for her family members in Sudan. The three women are passionate to help their community back in Sudan. Komi blamed government corruption and the war for making it difficult for people to live their lives. “People, lovely people. They have hopes, they have dreams. They want to go to school,” Komi said. “Sudan is a great country,” Amon said. “We’re kind to one another.”",Local,"Wed, 24 May 2023 20:56:47 EST",8dcd19e7727918a5c78a1747ca7b8ea0

Herwick III embedded himself at the beloved drinking spot.","To say that Sligo Pub was a fixture in Somerville’s Davis Square would be something of an understatement.The small, nearly windowless hole-in-the-wall holds the oldest liquor license in the neighborhood, according to its website. And according to Tom Mannion, who ran Sligo from 1989 until his death last year, the space — once called Mahoney’s and prior to that Pat Connelly’s — has been a bar since at least 1932.Somerville’s Ivonne Blanco, a regular patron for years, described it as “a pleasantly gnarly dive bar.”No longer.We spent some time in Sligo during its final week talking with numerous loyal patrons to find out what set it apart from the multitudes of other bars, why its closure is hitting them so hard and how it will be remembered.“Everything else is like a bistro pub, it's a brewery. And this is just, it just screams, 'It's a bar,'” said patron Dave Wasserman.“The bathrooms are gross, they don't serve food, but it's all these things that kind of make it what it is” said Ulysses Lateiner. “It's the last bar of it's kind of just Davis Square and things definitely won't be the same when it's gone.” The rumblings of Sligo’s demise started to churn through Somerville in 2019, when real estate developer Scape purchased the block of Elm Street — home to Sligo and other restaurants and businesses — for nearly $10 million. Speculation at the time was that Scape would develop the block into a large residential building for students, a specialty of the British-based firm. But last year, Scape announced they would construct a four-story life sciences complex that will include lab and commercial space at the street level.When Somerville’s planning board approved the project in September 2022, Sligo’s operators said the deal most likely spelled its end. When the news finally broke this spring that Sligo’s was closing for good on June 4, it elicited everything from despair on social media, to elegies in the local press, to philosophical musings from Sligo regulars. “You catch me on a good day and it's like, well, that's the reality of the world,” said Tim Dalton, who’s been coming to Sligo for four decades. “Catch me on a bad day and there's just real anger that a lot of, you know, old Boston is disappearing.”“You meet a lot of different people – characters I guess you could call it,” said bartender Sean McDonald. “People are tethered to this place, or their friendship is tethered through this place.”",Local,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 09:18:24 EST",d192544b1e89ad093a2b3aa83758db6e

The rally came ahead of Trans Day of Visibility on March 31, which, in Washington, D.C., will culminate with the March for Queer & Trans Youth Autonomy. It will be the first major queer and trans-led demonstration in the nation’s capital. “We’re just here to say that we deserve gathering not just on hot June parades, but also on wet March mornings,” said North American Indian Center of Boston civic engagement coördinator Reggi Alkiewicz during their address to the crowd. It was evident that the damp chill of early spring did not temper the enthusiasm radiating from Beacon Street. Commission executive director Shaplaie Brooks emphasized the commonwealth’s legacy of pioneering social initiatives and the necessity that it remain at the vanguard of progressivism: Massachusetts is the first state to have such a commission centered on the wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. But the commission is counted as but one victory, and Brooks was vocal about the need for continuous political engagement. She pointed to the nationwide statistics: 434 bills in U.S. state legislatures target LGBTQ people, according to a tracker from the ACLU. “Consider this the home base for the national march that’s in Washington this Friday,” Brooks exclaimed during her remarks. Even if Massachusetts isn’t one of the several states that has already passed explicitly anti-trans legislation, such sentiment still exists here: a group including apparent neo-Nazis interrupted a drag story hour in Taunton, and Boston Childrens’ Hospital has received multiple bomb threats from harassers over the gender-affirming care the hospital provides. “Thanks to MassEquality, we know that in Massachusetts alone, there are 48 districts and counting that have anti-LGBTQ activity,” Brooks said. Commission vice chair Noemi Uribe reiterated that the state should focus on proactive legislation to combat this antagonism: “Even though we don't have legislation or filed bills right now that are anti-LGBTQ or anti-trans, that activity is still something we need to listen to, and we need to call on legislators to pass protections to prevent anything from happening.” Despite the energy at the rally, the event was also an indicator of the remaining work to be done: in the crowd there was a conspicuous lack of Black youth, something that co-chair Craig Martin acknowledged. “Our youth of color don’t always have the spaces where they can feel brave and be public, because they are generally the ones who are most targeted, experience the most violence, and actually seem to be invisible in the very sphere of the community,” he said. “Not having them here means we still have a lot more work to do to create a brave space for them to come out and just be in community.” A part of that work includes the commission’s annual report, due April 27, that provides “evidence-based and community-sourced recommendations” to both the state Legislature and statewide agencies, outlining policies and programs to secure the well-being of LGBTQ youth.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 15:50:06 EST",ccc7ae8aa138f896ad4a161ecafb4358
5342,Trump charged over classified documents in 1st federal indictment of an ex-president,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/06/08/trump-says-hes-been-indicted-in-classified-documents-investigation,The Justice Department did not immediately publicly confirm the indictment.,"MIAMI (AP) — Donald Trump said Thursday that he has been indicted on charges of mishandling classified documents at his Florida estate, igniting a federal prosecution that is arguably the most perilous of multiple legal threats against the former president as he seeks to reclaim the White House.The Justice Department did not immediately publicly confirm the indictment. But two people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly said that the indictment included seven criminal counts. One of those people said Trump's lawyers were contacted by prosecutors shortly before he announced on his Truth Social platform that he had been indicted.The indictment enmeshes the Justice Department in the most politically explosive prosecution in its long history. Its first case against a former president upends a Republican presidential primary that Trump is currently dominating, and any felony charges would raise the prospect of a yearslong prison sentence.Within 20 minutes of his announcement, Trump, who said he was due in court Tuesday afternoon, had begun fundraising off it for his 2024 presidential campaign. He declared in a video, “I AM AN INNOCENT MAN!” and repeated his familiar refrain that the investigation is a “witch hunt.”The case adds to deepening legal jeopardy for Trump, who has already been indicted in New York and faces additional investigations in Washington and Atlanta that also could lead to criminal charges. As the prosecution moves forward, it will pit Trump’s claims of sweeping executive power against Attorney General Merrick Garland’s oft-stated mantra that no person, including a former commander in chief, should be regarded as above the law.The indictment arises from a monthslong investigation by special counsel Jack Smith into whether Trump broke the law by holding onto hundreds of documents marked classified at his Palm Beach property, Mar-a-Lago, and whether Trump took steps to obstruct the government’s efforts to recover the records.Prosecutors have said that Trump took roughly 300 classified documents to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, including some 100 that were seized by the FBI last August in a search of the home that underscored the gravity of the Justice Department’s investigation.Trump and his team have long seen the special counsel investigation as far more perilous than the New York matter — both politically and legally. Campaign aides had been bracing for the fallout since Trump’s attorneys were notified that he was the target of the investigation, assuming it was not a matter of if charges would be brought, but when.But it remains unclear what the immediate and long-term political consequences will be for Trump. His first indictment spurred millions of dollars in contributions from angry supporters and didn’t damage Trump in the polls. No matter what, the indictment — and the legal fight that follows -- will throw Trump back into the spotlight, sucking attention away from the other candidates who are trying to build momentum in the 2024 presidential race.Trump has insisted that he was entitled to keep the classified documents when he left the White House, and has also claimed without evidence that he had declassified them.The case is a milestone for a Justice Department that had investigated Trump for years — as president and private citizen — but had never before charged him with a crime. Garland was appointed by President Joe Biden, who is seeking reelection in 2024.The former president has long sought to use the mounting legal troubles to his political advantage, complaining on social media and at public events that the cases are being driven by Democratic prosecutors out to hurt his 2024 election campaign. He is likely to rely on that playbook again, reviving his longstanding claims that the Justice Department — which, during his presidency, investigated whether his 2016 campaign had colluded with Russia — is somehow weaponized against him.Among the various state and federal investigations that Trump faces, legal experts — including Trump’s own former attorney general — had long seen the Mar-a-Lago probe as one of the most likely to result in indictment and the one where evidence seemed to favor the government. Court records unsealed last year showed federal investigators believed they had probable cause that multiple crimes had been committed, including the retention of national defense information, destruction of government records and obstruction of an investigation.Since then, the Justice Department has amassed additional evidence and secured grand jury testimony from people close to Trump, including his own lawyers. The statutes governing the handling of classified records and obstruction are felonies that could carry years in prison in the event of a conviction.Signs had mounted for weeks that an indictment was near, including a June 5 meeting between Trump’s lawyers and Justice Department officials. After that meeting, Trump said on social media that he anticipated he could be charged, even as he insisted that he had done nothing wrong.Though the bulk of the investigative work had been handled in Washington, with a grand jury meeting there for months, it recently emerged that prosecutors were presenting evidence before a separate panel in Florida, where many of the alleged acts of obstruction scrutinized by prosecutors — including efforts to move the boxes — took place.Trump’s legal troubles extend beyond the New York indictment and classified documents case.The special counsel has a separate probe underway focused on efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. And the district attorney in Georgia’s Fulton County is investigating Trump over alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election in that state.The classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, along with thousands of other unclassified government records, were taken from the White House to the Florida club after Trump left office in January 2021.The Justice Department has said Trump and his lawyers repeatedly resisted efforts by the National Archives and Records Administration to get the documents back. After months of back-and-forth, Trump representatives returned 15 boxes of records in January 2022, including about 184 documents that officials said had classified markings on them.FBI and Justice Department investigators issued a subpoena in May 2022 for classified documents that remained in Trump’s possession. But after a Trump lawyer provided three dozen records and asserted that a diligent search of the property had been done, officials came to suspect even more documents remained. They obtained surveillance footage boxes of records being moved from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago.The investigation had simmered for months before bursting into front-page news in remarkable fashion last August. That’s when FBI agents served a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago and removed 33 boxes containing classified records, including top-secret documents stashed in a storage room and desk drawer and commingled with personal belongings. Some records were so sensitive that investigators needed upgraded security clearances to review them, the Justice Department has said.The investigation into Trump had appeared complicated — politically, if not legally — by the discovery of documents with classified markings in the Delaware home and former Washington office of President Joe Biden, as well as in the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence. The Justice Department recently informed Pence that he would not face charges, while a second special counsel continues to investigate Biden’s handling of classified documents.But compared with Trump, there are key differences in the facts and legal issues surrounding Biden’s and Pence’s handling of documents, including that representatives for both men say the documents were returned as soon as they were found.In contrast, investigators quickly zeroed on whether Trump, who for four years as president expressed disdain for the FBI and Justice Department, had sought to obstruct the inquiry by refusing to turn over all the requested documents. The focus on obstruction was reminiscent of the special counsel investigation Trump faced as president, when prosecutors examined whether Trump illegally tried to thwart the Russia probe, including by firing his FBI director.",National,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 20:15:36 EST",4964823be6eb9b221ca2e6c02c065645

More registered nonvoters reported that they ""forgot to vote"" in last year's elections than in the 2018 midterms (up 2.2 percentage points). Still, the most common reason for not casting a ballot last year was ""Too busy, conflicting work or school schedule"" (26.5% of registered nonvoters), followed by ""Not interested, felt my vote wouldn't make a difference"" (17.6%) and ""Illness or disability"" (12.5%).Among racial and ethnic groups, Asian American voters were most likely to vote early or by mail, while Black voters were the least likely. Black voters notably had the lowest rate of voting by mail out of all the groups, at 20.7%.An earlier round of surveying by the bureau previously found that 2020 saw the highest voter turnout of this century, with 66.8% of adult U.S. citizens casting ballots in that presidential election year, despite the hurdles brought on by the early months of the pandemic. COVID led many states and local communities to increase access to mail and early voting.Edited by Benjamin Swasey [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Tue, 02 May 2023 13:29:00 EST",f467ef08329348df0b0ed924611ec3a4
2841,Why more Pride parades are popping up in Massachusetts' small cities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/31/why-more-pride-parades-are-popping-up-in-massachusetts-small-cities,"Organizers want LGBTQ+ residents to feel at home in small towns and cities like Newburyport, not just major urban centers.","On a blindingly bright morning, Paul Goldberg looked up a main street in downtown Newburyport, pointing out the route he helped plan for the small city's first Pride parade. This Saturday, the inaugural event will step off from the old court house. “We’ll walk down Green Street to the end,” he said, turning to look north, “cross over to the waterfront there and walk along the boardwalk, just a short way into Waterfront Park.” Just over a year ago, it’s an event that would’ve been a distant dream in the city of less than 20,000. Last May, plans for a queer youth dance were thrown into chaos when the venue, a local Masonic lodge, abruptly pulled out less than two weeks before the event. The social organization’s statewide leadership had gone over members’ heads and called off the dance, seemingly over concerns about hosting an event for LGBTQ+ youth with a drag queen. But just as quickly, Newburyport’s community responded with a rush of support. Five venues offered up their spaces. Locals put together a welcoming wall of neighbors, where more than a hundred people showed up to wave flags, celebrate and stand in solidarity with the high schoolers. And the Masonic lodge went against orders: they hosted the dance anyway. It was a turning point for the city. Beyond Newburyport, organizers in small towns and cities across Massachusetts are making a concerted push for their queer neighbors feel seen and supported in their own communities, without having to go to the nearest big city. And it’s an effort that’s taken on additional meaning amid a national rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation in state legislatures. “After the ‘Over the Rainbow’ dance last May, we kind of reflected on everything that had happened — and the biggest takeaway was just this overwhelming outpouring of support from the community for our young people,” said Tarah MacGregor, who is now one of the Newburyport Pride board chairs. “We were like, ‘OK, Newburyport needs a Pride, right?’” she said. The nine-person committee in Newburyport, which had its first official meeting in December, is now putting the finishing touches on a dozen events, including a flag-raising with Gov. Maura Healey. “Every time somebody attacks our kids, it backfires ... because the community comes back with more love and more support than we could ever have imagined,” said James Giessler, who leads NAGLY, the North Shore Alliance of GLBT Youth. It co-sponsored last year’s dance. “As we see in Newburyport, with all the ruckus that they had, now they’re going to have one of the most spectacular Pride observations on the North Shore.” The Pride celebrations popping up in smaller cities and towns often take cues from the original marches, which were political protests in major cities that go back 50 years to commemorate the Stonewall riots. But today, these smaller Prides focus more on celebration, promoting visibility and making residents feel safe. Newburyport is far from Massachusetts’ first Pride outside of Boston; it’s not even the first Pride on the North Shore. Hope Watt-Bucci wanted to fight back against hate in her own community after she witnessed an older gay couple being mocked in a local restaurant and heard stories of homophobic taunts and assaults circulated on the North Shore. So, in 2012, she founded North Shore Pride and its first parade marched through Salem that June. Watt-Bucci remembered thinking she’d be glad if a hundred people came to the group’s first event. “Thousands of people showed up,” she recalled. “And I thought that, ‘OK, yeah, we need to do this. We clearly need to do this.’”Last year’s parade in Salem attracted 20,000 celebrants. Enough Pride celebrations have cropped up over the last decade that Watt-Bucci started what she calls the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together organizers from different North Shore celebrations. She and a dozen other organizers gathered on a recent Tuesday evening at a Beverly restaurant. It was a logistics-dominated evening, talking through event insurance, food trucks and 501c3 paperwork. But the room often burst into applause as organizers reveled in the dozens of events that would be held in cities and towns across the North Shore in June: drag queen bingo in Wenham, youth Pride in Lynn and a flurry of flag-raisings. This year, Topsfield is hosting Tri-town Pride for the second year with Boxford and Middleton — though it’s the first year they’ll have a parade — in response to a protest at a Boxford drag queen story hour last year. A formalized nonprofit is organizing Pride in Lynn for the first time. Revere will host its second annual “Beach Pride.” Wenham and Hamilton will have their third joint Pride picnic. Swampscott had its first Pride in 2020, and this year there’s a new addition: a “Run with Pride” 5k. Parades and other celebrations are often just “the tip of the iceberg” of deeper changes in the towns that are hosting them, according to Kim Creasap, who researches small-town Pride events in the Midwest. She’s found Ohio towns where organizers are celebrating the passage of a local ordinance, scaling up the reach of local support groups or hoping that a big celebration could be an economic boon. “There was actually a lot of advocacy behind the scenes leading up to Pride,” Creasap said, referencing those Midwestern cities and towns. “So, in other words, the Pride parades — or picnics, or festivals — were kind of a more visible consequence of a less visible community organizing that has been going on.” Joan Ilacqua leads The History Project, which preserves archives of New England’s LGBTQ+ history. She thinks part of the reason that more towns are hosting Prides is to fill the “vacuum” left by Boston Pride, which last hosted a parade in 2019, and that the increase in small-town and small-city Prides is the sign of a real shift. “People are feeling more comfortable being visible where they are, being in community with their neighbors,” Ilacqua said. “It kind of proves that you don't have to go away to the big city to be part of the queer community.”In Wenham, the third annual Pride flag raising is being organized by the city’s human rights committee. Martha Brennan, the chair, thought back to when the committee was first formed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, with the goal of making residents of all backgrounds feel more welcome in town. “One of the really endearing things that happened after our first flag raising was that a lesbian couple said it was the first time that they felt comfortable walking down the street holding hands because there’s not a lot of visibility,” Brennan recalled, referring to her town with 5,000 residents. “It’s a very small town and people are unsure of what others are thinking. And so it’s a nice way to signal that everybody’s welcome.” For Newburyport, this new chapter started with a difficult launching-off point, but one that many community members are glad to turn into a positive change for their city.The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in a written reply to GBH News, said it decided that it was not the right organization to hold the event, and that it would have been better suited for a school or public building. Last year, members of the Masonic lodge, which had initially canceled the queer youth dance on the organizers, ended up rebelling against the statewide organization.“The feeling was overwhelming, knowing that we were providing a safe space for them,” Michael Switzer, the former leader of the St. John’s Lodge, said when he thought back on that night last spring. “Knowing that even an ounce of that discrimination and pain that they felt came from our organization, we knew that we had to do the right thing.” It came with consequences. Many of the local Masons were reprimanded, suspended or expelled from the organization for their decision. But Switzer and others decided to form a new social club called the Wolfe Club that, this year, is sponsoring Newburyport Pride and is planning its own event to raise more funds for the Pride committee. “It’s really been fulfilling for us to come full circle,” Switzer said. “When you’re an ally and you make a sacrifice, it doesn’t have to be a sad, negative story. ... And it’s really been amazing to see what we’ve been able to accomplish in a year.” Seventeen-year-old Sully McLellan was one of the high schoolers at last year’s dance — one of at least 100 kids. “There was more food than we needed. We had, like, pints of ice cream that was donated that were never broken into,” he said. “It was just a really good experience. And the drag queen was really good, too.”This year, the youth dance will be held at City Hall. McLellan is taking the lead on organizing with a blacklight, outer-space theme. Members of the new Wolfe Club will be stationed outside, donning shirts that read “safety and support.” Hundreds of T-shirts and stickers are on their way for people and businesses around town to advertise their LGBTQ+ pride, and groups are readying to march their way down Green Street to the city’s waterfront on Saturday.For parade co-chair MacGregor, who grew up in a New Hampshire town just across the border from Newburyport, it’s coming full circle, too. “Growing up as a young queer person, I didn’t feel like I had community. And being able to be part of this volunteer mission, to create community where there is so much support and where young people can grow up and see these events happening and feel valued by their community?” she said. “That’s the goal.”",Local,"Wed, 31 May 2023 05:00:29 EST",cdbbfabf364193f3888c91adad2fa96c
466,Delivery drivers want protection against heat. But it's an uphill battle,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/20/delivery-drivers-want-protection-against-heat-but-its-an-uphill-battle,"For nearly a decade, Viviana Gonzalez has spent her summers delivering packages for United Parcel Service under sweltering sun in Palmdale, California – in a truck without air conditioning.","For nearly a decade, Viviana Gonzalez has spent her summers delivering packages for United Parcel Service under sweltering sun in Palmdale, California – in a truck without air conditioning.A typical work day means at least 10 hours in and out of one of UPS' brown delivery vehicles, where temperatures in the back, Gonzalez said, at times surpass 150 degrees. Her only relief is a fan that blows hot air into her face.Gonzalez has come to expect waves of nausea and weakness throughout the day. ""We're out there for hours, so you can only think about how much stress we're putting on our bodies,"" Gonzalez said.Delivering packages is a solo task. Sometimes, Gonzalez calls her friends for support while she's on her delivery route, in case her health takes a turn for the worse. Last June, a 24-year-old Palmdale UPS driver named Esteban Chavez was found unconscious in his truck while on his delivery route in Pasadena. Chavez died of sudden cardiac dysfunction, according to the medical examiner's report. Temperatures exceeded 90 degrees that day, and his family believes his heart failure was due to the heat.Another driver, 23-year-old José Cruz Rodriguez, died from a heat-related illness, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, during his UPS delivery shift in Waco, Texas, in August 2021. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against UPS and ultimately settled with the company.Gonzalez often thinks of her 18-year-old son when she's out driving.""What would've happened to him if I had died in the back of the truck?"" Gonzalez said. ""We are putting our lives at risk by delivering in these hot weather conditions. And we're human – we don't know what our body is going to take.""New heat safety measures at UPSConditions are set to change for UPS delivery drivers nationwide. UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents 340,000 UPS workers, negotiated a tentative heat safety agreement in June to install air conditioning systems in all of the company's small package delivery vehicles purchased after Jan. 1, 2024.UPS said it will send the new vehicles to the hottest parts of the U.S. first, when possible. The company has also agreed to add new heat shields and fans in delivery vehicles. The agreement will be finalized once UPS and the Teamsters negotiate a new contract – a process that could lead to the largest strike against a single employer in U.S. history.Teamsters President Sean O'Brien called the heat safety agreement a ""significant step towards a stronger new reality for so many workers and their families."" UPS said in a statement that worker safety ""remains our top priority."" Jim Mayer, a UPS spokesperson, said the company currently supplies its employees with cooling gear. But drivers have to get through this summer's heat waves – mostly without air conditioning.""We're still going to have to live through this peak, but it's almost like a touchdown,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're almost there.""Drivers at UPS competitors also concerned about heat risksOSHA lists mail and package delivery as one of the primary industries where outdoor workers suffer from heat-related illnesses. The agency's work-related injury database shows at least 40 UPS drivers have been hospitalized due to heat-related illness since 2015. It's not just a UPS concern. Drivers working similar jobs for UPS' competitors – including Amazon and FedEx – are also raising alarms about heat on the job as climate change causes temperatures to rise. Both companies said their delivery vehicles are equipped with functioning air conditioning. But drivers Renica Turner and Demetria Forte, who deliver packages for Amazon, as well as Johnathon Ervin, the owner of an Amazon subcontractor, told NPR the air conditioning is often broken in Amazon-branded vans.Most workers at Amazon and FedEx aren't represented by a union – and they aren't even classified as company employees, making it that much harder to demand protections.Amazon workers join the fightLast April, Turner was delivering Amazon packages on a 110-degree day in Victorville, California – northeast of Los Angeles – when her body started to tingle. She thought she might pass out.Amazon said company-branded vehicles have functioning air conditioning, and those without it are immediately grounded. But Turner said the air conditioning and fans in the van weren't working on that day. When she rolled down the windows, hot air drifted inside. She said she let the Amazon dispatcher know about her symptoms. All she got was a 20-minute break.""They never sent no one out to help me with the rest of the route,"" Turner said, referring to the 300 packages she was expected to deliver, at a rate of 25 per hour. ""I had to deliver the rest of that, feeling woozy, feeling numb, and just really overwhelmed."" Turner works for an Amazon subcontractor called Battle Tested Strategies, or BTS. It's one of about 3,000 independent contractors in the e-commerce giant's delivery network – small businesses contracted by Amazon to deliver packages.BTS owner Johnathon Ervin, who leases vans from Amazon, said Amazon regularly fails to fix broken air conditioning in the vehicles. He said it can take weeks, even months, for Amazon to repair the vans.""It's insane that we're forced to drive these vehicles,"" Ervin said. ""We went to Amazon, asked them to retire the vehicles, and it went on deaf ears.""Email communications reviewed by NPR show BTS has reported several cases of malfunctioning air conditioning in leased vehicles. On September 1, 2022, Ervin wrote in an email to Amazon that the air conditioning units in five vans stopped working on that day alone. Similarly, in June 2021, emails show it took weeks for BTS to get air conditioning units fixed, as the subcontractor navigated delays from Amazon's third-party repair companies. An Amazon spokesperson said Amazon is not responsible for delays, adding that subcontractors are in charge of fixing the vans. Turner and 83 of her colleagues unionized with Teamsters and bargained a contract with BTS in April, in large part to push for heat safety measures. It's the first union of its kind in the Amazon delivery network. These newly-unionized drivers have been on strike since late June over Amazon's termination of its contract with BTS. Ervin and the Teamsters union allege Amazon is retaliating against the workers for unionizing; an Amazon spokesperson, however, said the company ended its contract with BTS over unrelated contract breaches.Regarding heat safety, the spokesperson said Amazon adjusted some of its delivery routes last year so drivers can take more breaks to cool down. The burden falls on driversOSHA, the federal agency that oversees workplace safety, has recommendations for how employers should handle heat – but it's still in the process of drafting heat-specific worker protections. This means, currently, the county's biggest delivery companies have no legal obligation to provide nationwide heat protections for drivers.Brenda Jacklitsch, a heat stress expert at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said outdoor workers can experience heat-related illnesses ranging from heat rash and heat cramps to heat stroke.Employers, she said, can schedule the most physically intense work activities for cooler times in the day – and provide air conditioning and fans when possible. ""Even having an air-conditioned vehicle that is pre-cooled is a great way to help cool somebody down during a rest break,"" Jacklitsch said.Jacklitsch added that ""buddy systems"" can help workers look out for one another and monitor symptoms of heat stress. This can be a challenge for drivers who deliver packages on their own.For now, delivery drivers are doing what they can to protect themselves from extreme heat. Forte, another driver who delivers packages for Amazon in Palmdale employed by subcontractor BTS, said Amazon's expectation of 25 to 30 package deliveries per hour puts a strain on her health when temperatures surpass 100 degrees.Forte rotates through different vans for her delivery shifts. She tries to secure a van equipped with working air conditioning when she reports to work in the morning.But she said some days, she's stuck without AC, in which case she pours frozen bottles of water over the van's cooling rack.""(Customers) don't see all of that. They just see, 'Oh, yes, my package is here, great,'"" Forte said. ""They don't see what we go through on a daily basis.""

In explaining its decision, NPR cited Twitter's decision to first label the network ""state-affiliated media,"" the same term it uses for propaganda outlets in Russia, China and other autocratic countries.","NPR will no longer post fresh content to its 52 official Twitter feeds, becoming the first major news organization to go silent on the social media platform. In explaining its decision, NPR cited Twitter's decision to first label the network ""state-affiliated media,"" the same term it uses for propaganda outlets in Russia, China and other autocratic countries.The decision by Twitter last week took the public radio network off guard. When queried by NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn, Twitter owner Elon Musk asked how NPR functioned. Musk allowed that he might have gotten it wrong.Twitter then revised its label on NPR's account to ""government-funded media."" The news organization says that is inaccurate and misleading, given that NPR is a private, nonprofit company with editorial independence. It receives less than 1 percent of its $300 million annual budget from the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting.By going silent on Twitter, NPR's chief executive says the network is protecting its credibility and its ability to produce journalism without ""a shadow of negativity.""""The downside, whatever the downside, doesn't change that fact,"" NPR CEO John Lansing said in an interview. ""I would never have our content go anywhere that would risk our credibility.""In a BBC interview posted online Wednesday, Musk suggested he may further change the label to ""publicly funded."" His words did not sway NPR's decision makers. Even if Twitter were to drop the designation altogether, Lansing says the network will not immediately return to the platform.""At this point I have lost my faith in the decision-making at Twitter,"" he says. ""I would need some time to understand whether Twitter can be trusted again.""NPR is instituting a ""two-week grace period"" so the staff who run the Twitter accounts can revise their social-media strategies. Lansing says individual NPR journalists and staffers can decide for themselves whether to continue using Twitter.In an email to staff explaining the decision, Lansing wrote, ""It would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards.""For years, many journalists considered Twitter critical to monitoring news developments, to connect with people at major events and with authoritative sources, and to share their coverage. Musk's often hastily announced policy changes have undermined that. Lansing says that degradation in the culture of Twitter — already often awash in abusive content — contributed to NPR's decision to pull back.Musk proves conciliatory and erratic in BBC interviewPBS, which also receives money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the BBC, which is funded by a uniform license fee charged to British television viewers, are among those whose Twitter accounts were given the same designation.In the new interview with the BBC's James Clayton, Musk almost appeared to be seeking a compromise with the journalist. He said Twitter would adjust its labels for the British public broadcaster to ""publicly funded.""""We're trying to be accurate,"" Musk said. ""I actually do have a lot of respect for the BBC."" He said the interview offered him a chance to ""get some feedback on what we should be doing different.""When questioned by Clayton, Musk replied that the ""publicly funded"" label would apply to NPR as well. The change was not made before NPR's decision on Wednesday morning, however.The BBC exchange showed Musk as alternately conciliatory and erratic. He also said that he's sleeping on a couch at work, that he followed through on his promise to purchase Twitter only because a judge forced him to, and that he should stop tweeting after 3 a.m.""The point is the independence,"" NPR leader saysLansing says Musk is focusing attention on the wrong element of the equation.""The whole point isn't whether or not we're government funded,"" Lansing says. ""Even if we were government funded, which we're not, the point is the independence, because all journalism has revenue of some sort.""NPR's board is appointed without any government influence. And the network has at times tangled with both Democratic and Republican administrations. For example, NPR joined with other media organizations to press the Obama administration for access to closed hearings involving detainees held by U.S. authorities at Guantanamo Bay. And ""All Things Considered"" host Mary Louise Kelly stood her ground in questioning then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over then-President Donald Trump's actions in Ukraine despite being berated by Pompeo.Most of NPR's funding comes from corporate and individual supporters and grants. It also receives significant programming fees from member stations. Those stations, in turn, receive about 13 percent of their funds from the CPB and other state and federal government sources.It isn't clear that a withdrawal from Twitter will materially affect NPR's ability to reach an online audience. NPR's primary Twitter account has 8.8 million followers — more than a million more than follow the network on Facebook. Yet Facebook is a much bigger platform, and NPR's Facebook posts often are far more likely to spur engagement or click-throughs to NPR's own website. NPR Music has almost 10 times more followers on YouTube than it does on Twitter, and the video platform serves as one of the primary conduits for its popular Tiny Desk Series.Musk uses Twitter to question the legitimacy of media outletsNPR's decision follows a week of public acrimony, as Musk has used his platform to cast doubt on the legitimacy of major news organizations.The billionaire, who bought Twitter in October, previously announced he would remove check marks from the accounts of legacy news organizations unless the outlets paid for them. The coveted marks once meant Twitter had verified the authenticity of an account belonging to a news organization, government or public figure. Now, they can be bought through a monthly subscription.Musk also singled out The New York Times earlier this month, removing its check mark and calling its reporting ""propaganda."" Twitter's communications shop now simply responds to reporters' emails with poop emojis.At least three public radio stations preceded NPR to the exits at Twitter: Member stations KCRW in Santa Monica, Calif., WESA in Pittsburgh and WEKU, which serves central and eastern Kentucky.Fears that Twitter label could endanger journalistsJournalism and freedom-of-speech groups have condemned Twitter's labels, including PEN, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Committee to Protect Journalists.""NPR receives public funding, but is not state-controlled, meaning Twitter's listing could pose risks for journalists reporting from areas where suggestions of government affiliation have negative connotations,"" CPJ's Carlos Martínez de la Serna said in a statement urging Twitter to revisit its decision.Twitter's own guidelines previously said, ""State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the US for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media for the purposes of this policy.""That language has now been removed. In addition to NPR and the BBC, Twitter recently labeled the U.S. broadcaster Voice of America as government-funded media. Voice of America is part of the federal U.S. Agency for Global Media. But its editorial independence from government officials — at times hard won — is enshrined by law.""The label 'government funded' is potentially misleading and could be construed as also 'government-controlled' – which VOA is most certainly not,"" VOA spokesperson Bridget Serchak said in a statement to NPR.Serchak says VOA will continue to raise the distinction in talks with Twitter as the label ""causes unwarranted and unjustified concern about the accuracy and objectivity of [its] news coverage.""At Elon Musk's Twitter, unpredictability is the normLike so many policy decisions at the social network of late, Musk applied the label to NPR's Twitter account abruptly. It's still not clear why he became so animated about the issue.In his exchanges with NPR reporter Allyn, Musk said he was relying on a Wikipedia page dedicated to ""publicly funded broadcasters"" to determine which accounts should receive the label.When pressed for how he justifies the disclaimer considering NPR receives meager funding from the government and has complete editorial independence, Musk veered into conspiratorial territory.""If you really think that the government has no influence on the entity they're funding then you've been marinating in the Kool-Aid for too long,"" Musk wrote to Allyn.Musk's push to label the network even ran afoul of the site's own rules. A former Twitter executive who was involved in crafting the guidelines told NPR that the deciding factor in whether to issue the designation was whether an outlet had editorial freedom. The labels, the former executive said, were intended to give users context that a tweet they are seeing may be propaganda.The messy deliberations on display in Musk's email exchanges over labeling NPR's account are in line with his impulsive leadership style. His changes to the platform often are announced by tweet, with sudden reversals not uncommon, or promised changes never coming to fruition. Because Musk relishes troll-like behavior, there is always a possibility that his pronouncements turn out to be jokes. He has announced that the effective date for the change in the check mark verification system is April 20. The date is an inside joke among people who smoke or consume marijuana.Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Acting Chief Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing Editor Vickie Walton-James.

6390,'Love that Dirty Water': Is the Charles River actually that dirty?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/21/love-that-dirty-water-is-the-charles-river-actually-that-dirty,"For Earth Day, we checked in on how Boston's iconic river is doing, decades after being lambasted in The Standells’ “Dirty Water.”","Saturday is Earth Day, a day when we celebrate and reflect on the health of the planet we all call home. And that got us wondering about a famous piece of the earth in the city that we call home: The Charles River, the inspiration for the song Dirty Water. It got us wondering just how dirty the water of the Charles really is. Edgar B. Herwick III, the guy behind GBH's Curiosity Desk, joined GBH’s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Edgar, the Charles River — much maligned. But as we come upon Earth Day 2023, I mean, how dirty is the Charles? Edgar B. Herwick III: It's less dirty than it was in the '50s, which is when swimming was first restricted, and that was due to pollution. It's less dirty than it was in 1966 was when The Standells released that song. Paris Alston: Jeremy did a deep dive, speaking of water, into this last year, by the way.Siegel: They had never been to Boston when they wrote the song. Herwick: And their producer Ed Cobb, had been mugged in Boston, which was part of the inspiration for doing this. He wrote the song. He also wrote ""Tainted Love,"" by the way. So it's less polluted than it used to be. If we look at it now, the EPA has been giving a report card to the Charles River for decades. So this is sort of a good measuring stick in essentially assessing its cleanliness. There's lots of ways to look at how clean is a river. Their measure is like basically, how many days of the year is it theoretically swimmable and boatable, safely? So if you look back to the mid-to-late '80s, the start of this report card, the Charles River was a C and D student. It was not a great student. Its report card did not look very good. But in more recent years, they've now sort of split this report card out. They measure five different segments of the river, give each a grade. And in the last few years it's mainly now an A and B student for most of those segments. The one segment of the river that continues to lag a little bit is the Muddy River part. And even in 2022, that was up, from a D to a C, So that's improving as well. So generally not as dirty as it used to be. Alston: Okay. Well, what did it do? I mean, well, not the river itself, but what happened to improve its cleanliness?Herwick: Well, I mean, it's a number of things: Awareness, effort and money. I mean, that's kind of essentially it. So you can't understate the importance — we're talking about Earth Day, but these things that happened on the heels of that very first Earth Day in 1970: The creation of the EPA, the passage of the Clean Water Act, and the creation of an entire framework, legal and regulatory, for environmental protection issues. None of that existed when the first Earth Day happened. So that has been huge. I also spoke with Laura Jasinski, who's the head of the Charles River Conservancy. They're a nonprofit focused mainly on the lower Charles and its health, and the health of the environment around the river. And she talked about how infrastructure improvement, which has cost millions of dollars from lots of places. And they have done a better job of separating sewer drains from storm drains. So that was a huge issue for a long time in that when you'd get a lot of rain, the storm runoff would mix with sewer water and that would all end up in the river. And so you need an infrastructure where that doesn't happen. They've done a better job of that. And then there's been cleanup of the bank's areas. There's been efforts to manage the land near the river, and newer efforts, like a pilot program that they launched a few years ago where they've created a floating wetland in the lower basin. [Previously recorded] Laura Jasinski: By using basically an artificial island planted with native wetland species, we can add back some biodiversity to the sea wall edges that you see along Memorial Drive by MIT or down East Cambridge. And by adding back some of that biodiversity you can help absorb some of that pollution, and also add a lot of habitat value. That's really important for kind of the overall health of the river. [Recording ends]Herwick: So generally speaking, her overall assessment — Here's what she said:[Previously recorded] Laura Jasinski: We are definitely much better off than we were a couple of decades ago. But we also have new challenges with climate change that we need to address. [Recording ends]Siegel: Well, what are the challenges that climate change does pose? Herwick: There are numerous, but there are two main ones. One is runoff from the ground level during storms. So if you think about the lower Charles in particular, you have Memorial Drive, you have these roadways right near it. When we have a big rain, what happens is water from the ground level can't get absorbed by the ground and it ends up flowing all the way down into the river. And it carries with it all of the pollutants that we're putting at the street level. So there's all kinds of stuff that is getting into the river. So as we know, climate change means big rain events are happening more frequently. And so they're trying to figure out ways to keep that water from running off down into the river. So that's one big one. The other one is with rising temperatures comes increased likelihood of outbreaks of cyanobacteria or algae bloom. We see this, many years there'll be an outbreak of algae bloom in the river. And that stuff, not always, but it can sometimes be dangerous for pets, dangerous for people. And so trying to figure out ways to, as the temperatures rise with that happening more often, make the river a little bit more strong against that happening. So those are the two main sort of things happening right now in terms of climate change. Alston: So as you mentioned earlier, one of the measures of whether the Charles is healthy is whether it's swimmable. And so, can you swim in it? Herwick: So technically, no, it is prohibited. It remains prohibited unless you get a proper okay from the state. Siegel: But is that because it's dirty or no?Herwick: Right. And that's the thing. No. So in the past, like in the '50s, when they said no swimming in the Charles, it was mainly because of pollution. Now, most days, it is technically safe to swim in it. But the problem is we don't necessarily have the infrastructure for it, right? So you need a place to be able to get into the water safely. You don't want to hit boats, all of that stuff. Alston: Yeah. Not jumping off of a burning MBTA train. Well, that wasn't the Charles. Herwick: It was the Mystic. But The Charles River Conservancy does do, once a year for the last seven years, they do something called City Splash. And they've just announced that this year, that is happening on June 17. And that is a day where they get all the permissions from the state and then they let you swim in the Charles in a safe spot. So they sort of mark out an area and you can go swimming in the Charles on June 17. One of their goals, as we look at the next 20 years, is they want to try to figure out a way that people can swim in the Charles. They're looking for ways to find, through the summer, a place where they can establish that says, here's where you can swim. And hopefully in the future we will be able to swim in the Charles most days all summer. Siegel: For now, June 17, if you don't hear the three of us on the air, you can figure out why.Herwick: You can guess where we are. Siegel: Yeah. So, Edgar, we've made a kind of biweekly tradition of having a little trivia time with you as our question master when you're in here. I think we probably have time for one question. Herwick: Well, since we're talking about the Charles, let's stay with the Charles. So your question is: I think we, most of us, know that the Charles empties out into the Boston Harbor, and that's where it goes. But where does it begin? Your question is, do you know where the Charles River begins? Siegel: Okay, so rivers usually begin from mountains or something like that. Wachusett Mountain? Herwick: No. Do you want a hint? Alston: Yes. Herwick: You could describe, if we think about where it begins, you could describe its journey to Boston as a marathon. Alston: Hopkinton?Herwick: Hopkinton, Massachusetts, is where the Charles River begins. And unlike the marathon, which goes 26.2 miles, it goes for 80 miles. That's how meandering the path is. And it goes through 23 different communities on its way to Boston Harbor. But yes, just like the marathon, it begins in Hopkinton. Alston: Well, look at you bringing all the knowledge we did not know that we needed. I'm so glad.",Local,"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 13:31:52 EST",4eaac28b40ea6441828ecd5e3712f215

She later founded the Louis D. Brown Peace Institute in his honor. She now embraces restorative justice, with a goal of reconciliation.“Our focus [at the institute] is on peace; survivor led, offender sensitive,"" Chéry said on Greater Boston. ""I come at it from a community-based perspective and the evolution of the concept of restorative justice and this transformational justice.”Chéry said both the offender and victim’s family need to be part of the process to prevent retaliatory violence.“People make mistakes, and they need to be held accountable for those mistakes,"" said Linda Solomon, a restorative justice trainer, coach and executive conflict resolution consultant. ""But everyone involved needs to have a say in that process. The foundation for that process is relationship-building, because the relationship you have with someone determines how you act with them.” Restorative justice it is not a new concept. Indigenous communities have resolved problems in a similar manner for years.Today’s restorative justice movement can be traced to the 1974 ""Kitchener Experiment,"" where two teenagers from Kitchener, Ontario were required to apologize and pay restitution to each one of the 22 people whose homes they had vandalized.Since then, restorative justice has expanded beyond the confines of the criminal justice system and is used in communities and schools through talking circles. Circles provide a safe place to have difficult conversations as there is no leader so everyone’s voice carries equal weight. “Oftentimes, young people don’t have the opportunity or don’t take the time to listen to other people’s stories,” said Solomon. ""And so, when we’re taught to listen to people’s stories, it’s the beginning of a beautiful practice for young people to see the value in each other’s stories — because that’s what change us.” WATCH: What is restorative justice?

2185,Everett school leaders file discrimination lawsuit against the mayor,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/21/everett-school-leaders-file-discrimination-lawsuit-against-the-mayor,The first women of color to lead the district say they've faced “blatant and overt acts of discrimination and retaliation.”,"Updated March 21 at 7:52 p.m.Everett’s school superintendent and her deputy seek damages against the mayor and school committee members claiming “blatant and overt acts of discrimination and retaliation.”Superintendent Priya Tahiliani and Kim Tsai, her deputy, filed a lawsuit against Mayor Carlo DeMaria in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday, accusing him of racism, retaliatory attacks and interfering with their work as they attempted to diversify the school district’s leadership. The civil complaint also lists the city of Everett and Everett’s school committee as defendants. The complaint says once Tahiliani and Tsai, both women of color, began to hire non-white applicants in a school district where “100%” of district-level jobs had been white, the mayor and school committee members subjected Tahiliani and Tsai to “demeaning and racist comments” and “discriminatory and retaliatory attacks.”“Their main offense?” the complaint says, “Being women of color who refused to maintain a ‘Whites only’ hiring policy for district level jobs.”In Everett’s school district, more than 80% of students are of color, but the teaching staff is nearly 90% white. Tahiliani and Tsai are the first people of color to head Everett’s school district. A spokesperson for the mayor, Erin Deveney, sent GBH News a statement Tuesday night. “Mayor DeMaria and the City vigorously deny Ms. Tahiliani’s and Ms. Tsai’s allegations,” she wrote. “The credible facts of the matter demonstrate that Ms. Tahiliani and Ms. Tsai were never subjected to discrimination of any kind by the City and the Mayor and there is simply no evidence to the contrary.”Tahiliani referred questions to her lawyer, who didn’t respond to GBH News by the time of publishing.The complaint alleges that during DeMaria’s reelection campaign in 2021, the mayor told members of the school committee and school employees that they needed to “get [Tahiliani] out” and threatened staff to “remember what team [they] are on.” According to the complaint, “the institutional racism championed by Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria and his cronies for the School Committee was and still is palpable.”Despite generally positive appraisals for her work and the award of a statewide prize in 2022 from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, on March 6 superintendent Tahiliani was denied a contract renewal in a vote by the school committee that includes the mayor. The mayor did not publicly explain his opposition to Tahiliani. Days after that vote, Everett high school students walked out of school and protested in front of City Hall. Tahiliani’s current contract ends in March 2024. Both Tahiliani and Tsai had filed separate complaints in 2022 with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, a necessary legal step before advancing to court. After Tahiliani filed her complaint in January, surveillance cameras were found in the ceiling of her office, and the complaint says, were removed by the FBI and are under investigation. The city is also the focus of an ongoing discrimination investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.This story was updated to include comment from Mayor DeMaria.",Local,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 15:58:32 EST",6abb7e43bb667421944358a61aab3306
1415,"New centers offer care for mental health and addiction, but leave out most privately insured patients",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/22/new-centers-offer-care-for-mental-health-and-addiction-but-leave-out-most-privately-insured-patients,State-funded community behavioral health centers offer coordinated care almost exclusively for Medicaid patients.,"Makenzi Buckely answered the phone at Riverside Community Care location in Norwood, and took a call from a worried mom, requesting a mental health evaluation for her child.“And you would like that to happen today?” Buckley asked. “OK. So, looking at my schedule, we could probably come out for 12:30, 1 o’clock.”This kind of mobile response is one of the services offered here and at 24 other community behavioral health centers or CBHCs that opened across Massachusetts in January. It’s a new statewide experiment in addressing mental health and addiction issues by funding a comprehensive range of services for patients. For now, though, insurance coverage issues prevent roughly three-quarters of patients from accessing much of the care these new centers provide.In addition to mobile response services like the team Buckley dispatched to do an evaluation, another service CBHCs provide is essentially a walk-in urgent care center for mental health and substance use disorders. They also offer overnight beds for patients who need that level of support and observation. ""What we've basically done is construct a whole new model of care,"" said Riverside President Vicker DiGravio. The way the state set up this new system allows for care from a whole team, he said.“Teams with expertise in substance use disorders, co-occurring disorders, mental health issues, teams that specialize in serving children and adolescents,” DiGravio said. “And the team involves a clinician and includes a care coordinator. It includes a peer specialist or a family partner."" The state also required CBHCs to have phlebotomy labs on site to test for drugs, make sure medication levels are OK, and other analysis.A directory of community behavioral health centers in Massachusetts is online here.The launch of this system was one of the last big initiatives celebrated by former Gov. Charlie Baker — perhaps the crowning achievement of his administration's so-called Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform. “This is incredibly innovative and it has the potential to be transformative for a variety of reasons,” said Lydia Conley, president and CEO of the Association for Behavioral Healthcare, which represents mental health and addiction treatment centers in Massachusetts, including almost all of the new CBHCs.“It funds behavioral health on a level that it should be,” Conley said. “It is a specialty. It has never been adequately resourced. This model adequately resources it.”The difference, Conley said, isn’t just that the state is paying more to support mental health and addiction treatment. There’s a whole different model for paying for those services.Usually, insurance companies bill for every individual service a patient gets. But for those who are covered for care at a CBHC, there’s just one rate for their combined services.”So if we provide one service, we bill the bundle and we get that rate,” DiGravio explained. “If we provide three or four services in one day, we bill the bundle once and we still get the same rate.”That means patients can get a broader range of services that they didn’t used to have access to, DiGravio said.“Hopefully, we’ll do a better job meeting the needs of the individuals we serve and helping them to avoid accessing higher, more expensive levels of care including emergency departments and inpatient hospitalizations,” he said.While care at these centers is covered for about 1.5 million people under MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, roughly three-quarters of insured people in Massachusetts have private insurance or Medicare, neither of which cover these services.A few insurance companies have signed up to cover CHBC care. But most haven't, and they aren't required to. ""It doesn't feel comfortable on the service delivery side to have sort of a two-tiered model or be offering care in two different ways when we feel very passionately that that full complement of services is what people need,"" said Kimberly Fisher, vice president of behavioral health services at Riverside.CBHCs won’t turn away anyone in crisis, and a state law requires private insurers to cover immediate care in those kinds of emergencies. Also, private insurers can be billed individually for some of the services at CBHCs. But patients can’t get coverage for recovery coaches, peer specialists, and other services like the in-house lab. The Massachusetts Association of Health Plans says some may be planning to contract with CBHCs, and others may still be evaluating the idea, since the program is in its early stages.DiGravio said he hopes more insurance companies will sign up once they can prove this model has better outcome and is more cost effective. And, he said, employers can play a role. ""If employers want their employees to have access to these services, they need to let the health plans they contract with know that this needs to be part of the benefit package,"" DiGravio said.Also, state legislation has been filed that would compel insurance companies to cover care at CBHCs.“I'm really hopeful that this legislation and my bill will make these treatment service providers available to everybody in our community, whether you have MassHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield, you name it,” said state Sen. John Cronin, who introduced the bill.That legislation isn’t going to pass overnight, though. Cronin said he’s hoping in the next year or two to get an analysis of the bill from the Center for Health Information Analysis, which should be able to make it more clear which insurance companies the state could require to cover this kind of care.",Local,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 14:06:06 EST",97f870ce33277913fa14c976dd2ee9bf
3136,Lexington robotics team engineers space for girls to thrive in STEM,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/04/04/lexington-robotics-team-engineers-space-for-girls-to-thrive-in-stem,"The Parity Bits and their robot, Esmerelda, talk about competitions and outreach.","Esmerelda the robot wheeled around the floor, her arms lifting up and down on hydraulics. She scooped up small red-and-blue cones and stacked them onto rods of varying heights, her motors whirring. On the edge of the fenced-in floor, Lexington High School student Anna Labbe gave commands: Up, down, turns and navigations. Her teammates, Nora Kapoor and Arushi Aggarwal, used controllers to drive her around. Esmerelda was designed, programmed and built by members of the Parity Bits, a robotics team for girls and nonbinary students at Lexington High School. Their name is a pun: A parity bit is a form of error-detecting code, added to the end of a string of binary code. It’s also a reference to gender parity in STEM fields. Women make up almost 30 percent of the STEM workforce, according to the professional association STEM Women. The Parity Bits want to increase that number.Esmerelda is about 18 by 18 inches, with purple and gold accents. She weighs about 30 pounds and is made of metal, wood, string and electrical wiring. The Parity Bits take her to competitions, where they and other high school teams see which robot can quickly and most efficiently stack cones. Their mission also extends to outreach: They visit elementary school students, where they present their robots and teach younger students about engineering. The Parity Bits were founded in 2014, born out of a co-ed robotics team at their school, 2 Bits and a Byte, when one member wanted a space for girls to shine — without being overshadowed by the boys.“I started back in fourth grade, but that was because my brother had a team with all of his guy friends,” Defne Olgun said. “And then as I got old enough to join, they were like, Oh, would you like to join us? Because we need girls on our team, so it looks good for the judges. I wasn't always the most confident. I would fiddle around with the Legos, but I wouldn't be the one putting the things onto the robot.”Most of the team had no robotics experience before joining the Parity Bits. Team member Priyanka Iyer says it's a common experience for girls exploring robotics — and that makes wins even more gratifying.“I think that when I’m in a community where my voice feels overshadowed by men, I sometimes don't feel confident in what I have to say, and I think their ideas are better,” Iyer said. “But then to be in an all-girls team and show that it is possible and we can do as much as they can. … To be able to do the same thing and go out and win awards and win matches with them, it feels really cool.”Aggrarwal said they foster an environment for learning, and for feeling secure in being able to practice, fail and try again. “You're not going to be perfect the first time,” Aggrarwal said. “And that's something that I think is hard for newcomers to remember. Part of that was saying to our new team members, you're going to be okay. And if you're not okay the first time, after the fourth or fifth or sixth time, Esmerelda is going to be fine and we're all going to be fine together.”Olgun said they also learn how to overcome challenges together. “Yes, it might suck when the string snaps for the eighth time that day, but you just have to keep going at it again,” Olgun said. “It’s also about sharing space and allowing others to take up as much presence in the room as I might sometimes; to fail on purpose and be okay with that process of growing and learning through the engineering process.”The environment has inspired many of the girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math after high school. Two of the graduating seniors plan to study computer science and robotics, and another plans to study mechanical engineering. They've become close friends along the way, and are leaving a legacy for the underclass girls behind them. “Over the course of the season, we're all trying to learn and grow as a team,” Audi Lin said. “We want to leave as much as we can behind for future generations.” At the end of the season, Esmerelda will be disassembled. Her parts will be used for a new robot next year.",Science and Technology,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 05:00:08 EST",70a3e5dcace611c2098d6b113e2c2822
707,Report: Mass. ranks most expensive for older people living alone,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/22/report-mass-ranks-most-expensive-for-older-people-living-alone,A new study shows Massachusetts’ high rents drive up the costs for adults over 65 living alone.,"New data suggests that Massachusetts is the most expensive state for older people living alone, meaning they’re more likely to face economic insecurity than older singles in any other state. Jan Mutchler, director of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston and creator of the Elder Index, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the results of the study. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: First, can you tell us a bit more about the Elder Index — what it is, what it measures and how it’s calculated?Jan Mutchler: Of course. The Elder Index is a measurement of how much it takes for older singles and couples to live independently in their own homes. We generate a bare-bones budget. It’s a very stripped-down budget, only covers housing, food, travel — and not the fun kind of travel, just getting around to the doctors and grocery store and travel expenses — medical expenses, and a small additional amount for added things like home goods and things like that. So we calculate this bare-bones lifestyle county by county for the entire United States. And we’ve been doing this here at UMass Boston Gerontology for about 12 years. Rath: As we mentioned, Massachusetts ranks first in the most expensive states for older people living alone, even ahead of New York and California. Do we have a sense of why? And also could you put that in perspective for us, give us a sense of scale? Mutchler: A lot of times, in these conversations, it’s helpful to think about the values for older renters in good health because many people do rent. It’s also a common transition as people get older for them to move out of owned homes and into a renter situation. So looking at those numbers, the value of the Elder Index for Massachusetts singles is just over $37,000 a year. That compares to the average U.S. value of about $29,000 a year. So you’re looking at $8,000 a year more being required for older singles to stay in their homes in Massachusetts. As you said, that is higher than Hawaii, New York and California — it’s the highest in the country. Rath: To make an obvious point, that’s a huge deal if you’re living on a fixed income. Tell us a bit more about this slice of the older population we’re talking about: people who are living alone. Do the demographics of this group, say the measures of race or gender, do they track with the general population? Or are they more predominantly one thing or another?Mutchler: When you’re looking at the older population living alone, you are disproportionately looking at white women. That’s not to say that they’re all white women by any means — but essentially, women do live longer than men, so the older we’re looking in the age range, the more women we’re seeing relative to men. White people also have higher longevity, longer life on average, than many other race and ethnic groups. They do live longer than African American elders, for instance.However, a lot of the reasons we see a disproportionate share of white people living alone relative to other groups is that other groups — the Latinx, Black and Asian populations — are more likely to be living with their children. Many of them do live alone, but a larger share lives with other people than is the case in the white population.Rath: Do we have a sense that this group, the older people who are living alone, is growing as we have an aging population?Mutchler: Yes. Over many, many decades, we can track the growth in the percentage of older people living alone. A lot of that is a function of outliving spouses. It’s also a function of many people not forming marital relationships at all. It’s a function of a sort of cultural norm where independence is highly valued in many groups; a lot of people feel that they should be living alone, that that’s expected, and that’s a desired outcome for them. But that does create these financial problems that we’re documenting with the Elder Index. It’s expensive to live all by oneself and cover all of your expenses, and the older you get, the higher those expenses may be. You can experience an increase in the health care expenses as you get older, and you may require more medications, more doctor’s visits and that kind of thing.Again, our report focuses largely on people who are renters. Especially in Massachusetts, but all the way across the country, the cost of renting has just spiraled and has hit older people very hard — as anyone who’s renting. But it has had a huge impact on older people. Rath: What you just said makes this next question even harder, and that’s: What can be done about this? I mean, this ties into things like housing prices, which are hard to deal with, and we’re dealing with it in a lot of ways across the board. Are there any kinds of interventions, policies that can help alleviate these burdens for older people living alone?Mutchler: There are things that that we can do, as a society and as a state, and things that families and individuals can do. The challenge to some extent is that what we're talking about is: a lot of the people who have incomes falling below the Elder Index are people who used to be middle class. They used to be okay, but with time, as they age and have lost a spouse ... and their income really has shrunk, and they’re no longer able to really cover this bare-bones budget that we calculate through the Elder Index. Some of those people will have incomes so low that they may be eligible for things like SNAP benefits, subsidies for health insurance, subsidized housing, things of that nature. Many of them will not have incomes that are low enough. They’ll be too low to really support an adequate lifestyle, but they won’t be low enough for some of the big programs that we’re aware of. They might be eligible for other programs, like fuel assistance and other sorts of supports.

His body was recovered from the wreckage inside the building last night.The presence of volatile chemicals and concerns about the stability of the building hampered the search for O’Keefe, Newburyport Mayor Sean Reardon told GBH News.While the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, Reardon and state and federal leaders are calling for more answers from the company’s owners and questioning whether the factory should be permitted to continue operating there.The fatal explosion at the factory was the third explosion or chemical fire at the site in three years. Since 2015, Seqens has faced numerous federal safety violations and fines from both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. “My first priority is public safety of our residents,” said Mayor Reardon. “I'm very interested in the investigation and what kind of evidence and what kind of findings that brings about. Then we'll have to determine if this is the type of work that needs to continue in the city.”Yesterday, members of the state's congressional delegation wrote a joint letter to Seqens North America, demanding answers and accountability from factory ownership.“This explosion is only the latest avoidable disaster at this facility, following years of serious safety violations, multiple fines, and other explosions,” Sens. Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Seth Moulton wrote. “We write seeking the explanation as to why this latest incident occurred and how, after years of fines and regulatory enforcement actions, Seqens could have allowed unsafe conditions to persist.”The lawmakers also asked Seqens to explain what it did to correct more than two dozen OSHA violations over the last seven years and what grounds the company cited to reduce the final fines it paid to federal regulators.“We can’t keep excusing companies’ flagrant disregard for worker safety,"" Markey wrote in a tweet yesterday.In 1997 and 2005, a chemical factory in Fitchburg run by Seqens, then-called PolyCarbon Industries, also experienced explosions, one of them injuring a worker’s hand. Seqens announced plans earlier this year to open a research and development center in Devens, according to its website.OSHA confirms opening a new investigation in the aftermath of the explosion to determine if Seqens has complied with OSHA workplace safety and health standards. OSHA has up to six months to complete this process and issue possible violations and fines.",Local,"Fri, 05 May 2023 13:39:19 EST",7155e781293897133520237a57edcbb3

She was 37 and had two small children. One spring day in March, she went for an X-ray at a large hospital in San Francisco. She had already had so many that the routine was all too familiar. ""I was getting used to the anonymous feeling of being treated as just a medical record number shivering in a white and blue hospital gown and scratchy blue hospital socks,"" Holmes Haddad said. Holmes Haddad was also still getting used to the fact that she didn't have any hair. It made her incredibly self-conscious. To make herself more comfortable going out, she would wear a head scarf to cover her bald head. But on that particular day, she had to take her headscarf off for the X-ray. ""I was so upset and just distraught about being bald in front of a stranger,"" Holmes Haddad said. The stranger, however, was bald himself. He was an X-ray technician with blue eyes and what Holmes Haddad described as a ""melodic Irish accent."" ""He just emanated kindness,"" Holmes Haddad said. ""I'm not sure what came over me, but as I was lying down on my back, waiting for the X-ray and holding my scarf, I told [him] that people stared at me and how much it upset me, and I hadn't prepared for that with cancer.""The man listened, and then looked straight into Holmes Haddad's eyes and said something that took her breath away: ""They're staring at you because you're beautiful.""""It was said with such kindness and sincerity, that it still stays with me today, as I remain in remission,"" she said. She can't recall his name, but Holmes Haddad said she will always remember how he made her feel in that moment.

6738,Cambridge and Boston grapple with how to respond to mental health 911 calls,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/23/cambridge-and-boston-grapple-with-how-to-respond-to-mental-health-911-calls,New pilot will send mental health clinicians with Boston EMS to emergency calls.,"The death of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, who was shot by Cambridge police in early January during what appears to have been a mental health crisis, has sparked a discussion about alternatives to sending armed police to respond to mental health calls. It's a conversation that's been underway in Cambridge and other Massachusetts cities for years before this fatal incident. GBH News Reporter Craig LeMoult spoke with GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about these ongoing conversations. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: In a statement last week, the Cambridge city manager pledged that Cambridge will use alternative responses outside of the police department for some emergency calls. What kind of alternative responses is Cambridge looking at? Craig LeMoult: Yeah, what happened is after the murder of George Floyd, Cambridge City Council created a task force to examine what they call the future of public safety. And that task force made its recommendations in May of 2021. They included the creation of a new community safety department, which was outside of police. It'll be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals who would respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The city allocated $3 million for that department, but I heard its creation was slowed down by a challenging time finding somebody to head it up. Last month, the city named an interim director of the department, and she told me they're planning to have responders from this new department going out on 911 calls in this coming fall of this year. There's also this community group that's growing called Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. And H.E.A.R.T. is an acronym for Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team. They've been getting training from members of the community to be responders for mental health calls, and they're trying to get a contract with the city to respond to mental health calls. I spoke with Stephanie Guirand of Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. She couldn't comment directly on the case of Sayed Faisal, the 20-year-old who was shot by Cambridge police last month because she said she wasn't familiar enough with the details. But she did say this. Stephanie Guirand, pre-recorded: If there was a history of crises, then we would want to do regular check-ins with the family and create a care plan and develop trust with everyone in the family so that, in a moment of crisis, the person in crisis would be seeing familiar faces — which would automatically de-escalate the situation. LeMoult: So she said a key element of their plan is to work with people to prevent crises from happening to begin with. I also talked with Cambridge City Councilor Marc McGovern. He's actually a clinical social worker and he was the co-chair of that city task force that made the recommendations. He said, even if they had the new department in place and if they had a partnership with Cambridge H.E.A.R.T., there almost certainly would have been a police response in the case of Sayed Faisal, because he had a knife. But he said, hopefully, there would have also been a mental health professional that responded. Marc McGovern, pre-recorded: And then you hope that the mental health professional can take the lead and de-escalate the situation in such a way that the police aren't needed. But I don't know of any program that doesn't respond with the police if there is a weapon involved. Rath: Craig, as you mentioned, it's not just Cambridge. City officials in Boston also have been trying to figure out how to change response to mental health calls, right? LeMoult: Yeah, And in a lot of ways, they're further along with this. I spoke with Boston Police Superintendent Lanita Cullinane, who's the chief of the Bureau of Field Services, and she said the BPD has a mental health clinician in each precinct — or at least they're supposed to, they're currently looking to hire a few. It's interesting, those clinicians come from outside the police department. They're actually from Boston Medical Center. The team is called BEST, which is another acronym. It stands for Boston Emergency Services Team. And they've been doing this for years. Here's Superintendent Cullinane. Lanita Cullinane, pre-recorded: The clinicians, while they do respond to calls, they also follow up and offer additional services after they respond to calls — or even on calls that they haven't responded to, they will reach out to individuals to offer services. LeMoult: She noted, in cases where a weapon is present, that clinicians do stay back. But she said, they're still involved. One other thing: the police cars that have these mental health clinicians are not reserved just for calls with a mental health component. They can get dispatched to other calls and potentially be unavailable if a call comes in. Superintendent Cullinane said they can pull from one of the other districts if necessary.But in August of 2021, when Kim Janey was acting mayor of Boston, she announced a plan to expand the program by changing that. Kim Janey, pre-recorded: The pilot initiative will dedicate core response cars to calls likely to have a mental health concern so that we are making these mental health teams available for the calls that would benefit from their presence the most. LeMoult: That was a year and a half ago and that pilot never happened. Those cars still are not reserved just for mental health calls. Rath: It's already the case that not just police can respond to mental health calls, right? Don't EMS sometimes show up a lot of the time when, say, there's a 911 call about someone having a mental health emergency?LeMoult: That's right. In fact, unless there's a criminal action involved, mental health 911 calls in Boston go to EMS. And Boston EMS is also piloting some new approaches to these kind of calls. First of all, there's a pilot underway now where someone who calls 911 experiencing a mental health issue could have the opportunity to be connected by phone to a mental health clinician from that so-called BEST team from Boston Medical Center. I spoke with Dr. Sophia Dyer, who's the medical director for Boston EMS. Sophia Dyer, pre-recorded: And then they work with the mental health clinician that they're speaking to about what the best next step is. And sometimes that next step is, they do need an ambulance and do need to go to the emergency department. Sometimes that step is other resources, other follow-up. LeMoult: As I said, that's just a pilot, and it's not available all day right now — those clinicians are currently available for about 8 hours a day. But Dyer told me about another pilot that Boston EMS plans to launch in the late spring of this year that would pair Boston EMTs with those mental health clinicians when they go out and respond to mental health calls. That's one of the things that Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced a year and a half ago. It's actually getting started in this spring with two response vehicles. Rath: It sounds them like co-response programs for mental health calls are starting to gain some traction. LeMoult: Yeah, you know, I spoke more broadly about these kinds of programs with Melissa Morabito. She's an associate professor at UMass Lowell School of Criminology and Justice Studies, and she studies these kind of programs. And she said Massachusetts has been at the forefront of the co-response movement. She said it was significant the Boston PD had made this part of their operating budget. It initially just been grant funded. You know, there's a program in Framingham that our GBH colleague Marilyn Schairer did a story about last year, and Morabito said Lowell is just starting a program. And she pointed out, as we've been talking about here, that there are a lot of different kinds of alternatives to just sending police to respond to a mental health call. Melissa Morabito, pre-recorded: I think that there's lots of places to kind of chip away at the margins and reduce the police footprint, but I don't think it's a quick decision. It's a slow process, and I think that there are lots of different alternative responses. I don't know that you can have one alternative response that's going to do all the things. LeMoult: And she really emphasized there needs to be more focus on increasing access to mental health care in the state so it doesn't get to a point of crisis. And, you know, Massachusetts is taking steps in that direction. I mean, just yesterday, you and I talked about the new 25 community behavioral health centers that opened around the state, although those are mostly just available now for people on the state's Medicaid system.So certainly it could be argued the state is making some progress in this regard, but there's still clearly a ways to go.

5974,Why a horror film starring Winnie the Pooh has run into trouble in Hong Kong,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/23/why-a-horror-film-starring-winnie-the-pooh-has-run-into-trouble-in-hong-kong,"A gory, microbudget slasher film — in which the beloved children's book character Winnie the Pooh is a murderous psychopath — has been pulled suddenly from theaters in Hong Kong and Macau.","A gory, microbudget slasher film — in which the beloved children's book character Winnie the Pooh is a murderous psychopath — has been pulled suddenly from theaters in Hong Kong and Macau. While the plot may not be everyone's cup of tea, there is concern that the decision to spike the British movie has less to do with the film's goriness and more to do with Beijing's suppression of civil liberties in Hong Kong and specifically, the government's efforts to block an unlikely symbol of protest: the crop-top-wearing, pant-less bear. ""Winnie the Pooh has become a symbol for dissidents in China,"" says Rongbin Han, an associate professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia. ""So now the character alludes to Xi Jinping himself and the president doesn't like this.""Pulled with no explanation from Hong Kong and MacauWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, written and directed by British filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield, has become something of an internet sensation, exceeding all expectations with releases across Latin America and Asia. It was scheduled to start screening at more than 30 cinemas in Hong Kong and Macau on Thursday, but the distributor said all showings have been called off. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey will be canceled in Hong Kong and Macau, VII Pillars Entertainment said in a statement on Facebook. The company added that the film ""failed to meet the audience"" and asked for the public's forgiveness. They offered no additional explanation and company officials did not respond to NPR's questions. How Winnie the Pooh became a subversive symbolThe last minute removal from theaters marks the second time that the release of a Winnie-the-Pooh-based film has been blocked in China. But why?The connection between Chinese leader Xi and Pooh can be traced back to 2013, when people on social media compared a photo of Xi and former President Barack Obama walking side by side to an image of Pooh and Tigger. The meme took off and for several years, government critics appropriated the character to make fun of Xi or lambaste his policies. That prompted Beijing to censor the Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh and animated gifs of the chubby, somewhat dopey bear on social media platforms in 2017.The University of Georgia's Han explained that it's not Pooh that's objectionable to Xi and the authoritarian regime, but the fact that critics are using the bear as a stand-in to denounce the government's policies. That's why, he says, ""the censorship machine"" is constantly looking for perceived criticism, which often takes the form of seemingly benign images, coded plays on words, or no words at all. For instance, in November in a rare show of public protest, Chinese dissidents marched through the streets holding up blank sheets of paper, sending a silent message of defiance to the authorities. Han noted that images or objects with Pooh's likeness are still permitted in China, but online is a different story. ""Anywhere that online dissident groups are mobilizing, that's what triggers the nerve of this state,"" he said. Given the history with the character, Han said he is surprised that the film got past the Chinese government's censorship system in the first place. Domestic and foreign films are all subjected to a strict pre-publication review system, and the government retains the right to ban any film that doesn't comply from being shown in theaters — or even from streaming online — within the country.Other challenges included quota on foreign filmsMichael Berry, director for the University of California Los Angeles Center for Chinese Studies, told NPR that a film like Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey would be up against a number of hurdles regardless of the Xi connection. ""Firstly there is a quota system in China that strictly limits the number of foreign films distributed; because of this quota, most studios submit big tentpole films like Marvel and DC superhero movies or big-budget war films. Smaller films often have trouble getting access to the market,"" Berry said. The UCLA professor also noted that China doesn't usually welcome horror films because the country has no rating system. The thinking is that all films should technically be suitable for general audiences. ""That provides inherent challenges when it comes to the horror genre,"" he said.For now, audiences in Hong Kong and Macau will have to wait for the possibility of watching a bloodthirsty Winne the Pooh.But as one would-be fan remarked, it may be coming to a streaming service near you.

Ayanna Pressley Tuesday night added her voice to the chorus of lawmakers calling on U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California to resign.Feinstein, 89, who has held her seat since 1992 and was the first woman elected to the Senate from the Golden State, has been on extended leave since February, when she was reportedly hospitalized with shingles. “Certainly, I wish [Sen. Feinstein] — who is a trailblazer in her own right and has ably and faithfully served in the Senate for many decades — I wish her well in her health and her recovery,” Pressley said during an appearance on Boston Public Radio’s inaugural evening program Tuesday. “But I do think that if it's impacting her ability to do the job, I would support a resignation.”The Massachusetts congresswoman’s comments came hours after U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow progressive, and former South Carolina governor and GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley both called on Feinstein to step down amid her extended absence from the Senate. Up until Tuesday, pressure for Feinstein to bow out came mainly from Democrats in the House, including Rep. Ro Khanna of her home state, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota.A resignation would empower California Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint a replacement until the 2024 election for Feinstein’s successor plays out.Senators from both parties have defended Feinstein. In her latest public statement regarding her absence on April 12, Feinstein signaled intent to return “as soon as possible” once cleared by her medical team. Later that month, Senate Republicans blocked an attempt to seat a temporary replacement at on the powerful Judiciary Committee that deals with Justice Department oversight, pending legislation and judicial nominations. Feinstein requested the move after pressure from Democratic colleagues seeking to advance stalled nominees. The work of the committee, Pressley said, “just is one example” of Democrats holding a narrow margin has proved consequential legislating amid a highly partisan political climate. Feinstein’s absence could also factor into forthcoming votes on the nation’s debt limit.The Sacramento Bee reported Tuesday that following a news conference, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s notes showed he is “hopeful” Feinstein will come back, though Feinstein’s office indicated it has no timetable for her return.",Politics,"Wed, 03 May 2023 08:42:22 EST",7241920350547298b710beeead3b15be

DeCologero, a Massachusetts gangster, are convicted of murder in Bulger's killing, they will not seek a death sentence.Geas also faced a possible death sentence if found guilty of an additional charge of murder by a federal prisoner serving a life sentence. But prosecutors said they would not seek it in the event he is convicted of that charge either.Geas and DeCologero were charged last August in the 2018 slaying of Bulger, who who ran the largely Irish mob in Boston in the 1970s and ’80s and served as an FBI informant who ratted on his gang’s main rival. Bulger was killed just hours after he was transferred to a prison in West Virginia from another lockup in Florida and placed in the general population.Geas and DeCologero are accused of striking Bulger in the head multiple times while a third man, Sean McKinnon, acted as a lookout. An inmate witness told authorities that DeCologero said he and Geas used a belt with a lock attached to it to beat Bulger to death.Geas, DeCologero and McKinnon are all charged with conspiracy to commit murder, which carries up to life in prison. McKinnon, who is charged separately with making false statements to a federal agent, did not face a possible death sentence. The men are scheduled to go on trial in December 2024 in federal court in West Virginia.Patrick Nash, an attorney for DeCologero, called it the “correct decision by the Department of Justice.”“We are looking forward to our day in court. We trust the system and trust the fairness of the system and will put the facts in front of the jury,” Nash said.Attorneys for Geas didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment on Wednesday.

2158,Spring has arrived. Here's when to plant food and flowers in the garden.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/spring-has-arrived-heres-when-to-plant-food-and-flowers-in-the-garden,Local garden experts are waiting just a bit longer.,"Spring is here, which means farm workers at the Haley House Thornton Street Urban Farm and Community Gardens are looking at seeds. “It is the first day of spring, and we are plotting and planning what we're going to be growing this season,” said Jay Vilar, program director at the Haley House. “A lot of the work that we're doing now is about just getting ready for the season. So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.""Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil. “What we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,” Vilar said. Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury. “In order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,” he said. Most produce won’t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said. “Typically when you start to put things into the ground and it’s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,” he said. “There are things that you can start early on — like peas — that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.” Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said. The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens. Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant — but not quite yet. Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners of Pemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont, said now’s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go. “We’re itching to get outside,” he said. “We are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale — all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost — so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.”Though most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold. “I appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,” he said. “This will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.”Most local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs — tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few — that will be ready to go into the ground. “Pansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,” Saidnawey said. “They'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.”Perennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: “Hellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.”Trees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it’s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.“By the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,” he said. It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens. “If you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,” Saidnawey said. “So it’s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.” People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said.

4417,Massachusetts US Attorney Rachael Rollins to resign after Justice Department ethics probe,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/16/massachusetts-us-attorney-rachael-rollins-to-resign-after-justice-department-ethics-probe,The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation.,"Updated May 16 at 5:29 p.m.BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins will resign following a monthslong investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general into her appearance at a political fundraiser and other potential ethics issues, her attorney said Tuesday.The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation, but an attorney for Rollins told The Associated Press that she will be submitting a letter of resignation to President Joe Biden by close of business Friday.The resignation of a U.S. attorney amid ethics concerns is an exceedingly rare phenomenon and is especially notable for a Justice Department that under Attorney General Merrick Garland has sought to restore a sense of normalcy and good governance following the turbulent four years of the Trump administration.Rollins' attorney said she has been “profoundly honored” to have serve as U.S. attorney and proud of her office's work but “understands that her presence has become a distraction.” Attorney Michael Bromwich — a former Justice Department inspector general — said Rollins will make herself available to answer questions “after the dust settles and she resigns.”""The work of the office and the Department of Justice is far too important to be overshadowed by anything else,” Bromwich said.The Justice Department didn't immediately comment Tuesday. The inspector general's office declined to comment.Rollins was a controversial pick to be Massachusetts’ top federal law enforcer and twice needed Vice President Kamala Harris to break a tie for her nomination to move forward in the Senate amid fierce opposition from Republicans, who painted her as a radical.Before taking the high-profile U.S. attorney job, she was the top prosecutor for Suffolk County, which includes Boston. In her role there, sparred with Boston’s largest police union and pushed ambitious criminal justice changes, most notably a policy not to prosecute certain low-level crimes such as shoplifting.She was the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts and the first Black woman to become U.S. attorney for the state.The Associated Press was the first to report in November that the inspector general’s office had opened an investigation into Rollins over her appearance last year at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser featuring first lady Jill Biden. The inspector general’s office generally investigates allegations of fraud, abuse or violation of other Justice Department policies.People familiar with the investigation told the AP at the time that the probe had expanded into other areas, including Rollins’ use of her personal cellphone to conduct Justice Department business and a trip she took to California that was paid for by an outside group.The inspector general’s office scrutiny into Rollins began after she was photographed last July arriving at a home in Andover, Massachusetts, where the DNC fundraiser with Jill Biden was held. That was according to two people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the probe.Rollins said in a July tweet that she “had approval” to meet the first lady and left the event early to speak at two community events. One person familiar with discussions before that event told the AP that Rollins was only given limited permission to meet Jill Biden outside the home.Rollins acknowledged the investigation during a December meeting with reporters, saying she doesn’t want her office to be “distracted” by the probe.“I certainly think any time there’s an investigation into anyone — and I’ve been the chief law enforcement officer in two different roles — it impacts you for sure,” Rollins said at the time.The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, another federal watchdog agency, has also been investigating whether Rollins’ attendance at the fundraiser violated the Hatch Act, a law that limits political activity by government workers. The status of that investigation is unclear.In addition to probing the fundraiser appearance, the inspector general’s office copied the phone contents of some employees in Rollins’ office as part of their probe into her possible use of her personal phone for Justice Department business, one person familiar with the matter told the AP last year.The inspector general also examined a trip Rollins took to California that was paid for by an outside group, even though Justice Department employees are not supposed to accept payments for travel. The trip was for CAA Amplify, the annual gathering of entertainment, business and political figures run by one of Hollywood’s leading talent agencies, the Creative Artists Agency.___Tucker reported from Washington.___This story has been corrected to reflect that Rollins was the first Black woman, not the first Black person, to serve as Massachusetts U.S. attorney.",Politics,"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:43:33 EST",dcabeff4b25e3e5d5f154c329ecfc13a

We asked our readers to share their optimistic strategies and they really, really did — nearly 100 wonderful responses. Stay optimistic! Here's a selection of the themes and thoughts and thank you to everybody who wrote in.The humor connectionHumor continues to be one of the things that gives me hope. No matter how hard life can get, there are always people who find a way to make things feel lighter. It could be as simple as silly viral animal videos or the more complex comedy that contextualizes our lives in the broader arc of history. Either way, we as humans tend to know when we need to break the tension and give ourselves a mental reset. -Eric Conrad, Washington, D.C.I don't think I could live in this world without humor. It's best when it is shared. It connects us to our loved ones but even brings us closer to strangers. Haven't you ever glanced across a room, caught someone's eye and shared a smile with a total stranger over a funny incident? It's understanding the human condition. We're still in this together. -Joy Stephenson, Gainesville, Fla.A simple grinI feel like I'm in a chronic state of despair over the various bad situations all over the planet, with my personal struggles on top of them. But several years ago, I walked into a hardware store that I hadn't been to in a long time. One of the cashiers (whom I didn't know from Eve) let out a loud ""Welcome back!"" and added, ""I love how every time you come in our store, you're smiling ... it makes my day."" I guess I was smiling without even realizing it and had no idea how simple smiles can affect other people for the better. -Richard Crank, Topeka, Kan.It's little things that cause that inward smile, like the cloud that swirls up from cream being poured into a hot cup of coffee. It's nice to have simple pleasures. I am thankful. I try to be observant of God's workings in my life and to be aware of His many blessing. Oh, I can get as negative and as angry as the next person, but I try not to stay there long. -Kathy Swanson, Clifton, Texas Think big thoughtsI majored in history, which can be a rather depressing subject. There has been so much oppression in so many ways since more or less the dawn of agriculture. On the other hand, we see dramatic change over time and across cultures regarding everything from the role of women to which professions hold prestige to how life should be lived to how people dress. The fact that things were different once means that society need not work as it does now, which I think is quite the empowering thought. -Christopher West, Cincinnati, OhioThis may sound cynical but I am being earnest: What gives me peace of mind when gloom is looming is to remember that in 5 billion years, the sun will become a red giant and Earth will cease to exist. With that perspective, it puts me more at peace that, for example, salmon may go extinct in my lifetime. It seems less critical to save them (and every other species) knowing that all species will one day share the same fate. (For the record, I hope salmon make it.) -Andrew Murphy, Crescent City, Calif.I try to keep in mind how little control or influence I have to change the state of the country (and world) and let go of the feeling of responsibility. I do what I can and understand that change is slow. One of the greatest gifts of getting old is knowing how little power you have in the grand scheme of things. It relieves you of the feeling that you have to DO something and the frustration and anger that goes with it. -Mary Theresa McCarty, Halfmoon, N.Y.Acknowledging sadness can lead to optimismTo remain optimistic I have to deliberately and regularly make room for my grief. If I acknowledge this weight I carry it can be a tool. It will still cripple me occasionally because burying a trans child is just that hard, but I can also fight for change if I bring my grief with me. - Carrie Black, Salt Lake City, Utah I am Buddhist and there is a meditation that helps me: You elect to feel hopelessness or lovelessness as a way of empathizing with others who feel these things. So when I feel hopeless or sad or overwhelmed, I can think, ""I am going to fully let myself feel this because this is what hopelessness feels like, what millions of others have felt, going back millennia."" Ironically, framing it this way actually feels more connected, more human, more manageable. -Kristin Harriman, Sacramento, Calif.I employ what I refer to as ""delusional optimism,"" which involves telling myself things like, ""It's going to be just fine!"" or ""You've been through much worse!"" or ""Tomorrow won't feel this bad."" The words I tell myself don't change the behavior of others. Difficult situations often remain difficult, but it does make it easier to weather the suffering. When the world won't change for us, sometimes changing how we think about the world is the best we can do. -Lisa Féinics, Bend, Ore.Steer your car wiselyOne of my favorite books is Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain. I remind myself, as the book states, ""The car goes where your eyes go."" It's so important, especially as the news cycle is full of cruelty and suffering, for us to carefully choose what we read, listen to, pay attention to. The car, my brain, goes where my eyes go — so I need to keep looking at hopeful art and look for joy in the children I love and remind myself to keep watching for good things. I see more of them this way! -Naomi Krokowski, Berthoud, Colo.Do unto othersDoing something for someone else is my all time high — it always lifts me. -Dianne Oelberger, St George, MaineEach morning I start my day by saying, ""God, how may I serve?"" I am a registered nurse working at the VA Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I believe that people are here to be of service to each other — to help, guide, comfort and support those we encounter along the way. Whatever the act of service I provide, the return is so much more. -Christine Grant, Washington, D.C. Be grateful for goodness ... and teaI ask myself two simple questions: First, what are you enjoying right now? For example, at the moment, I am enjoying a cup of strong black tea while I peruse npr.org. Second, what are you looking forward to? Some of the things I'm looking forward to are finishing today's chores, walking by the ocean this weekend, tutoring my adult learners next week and seeing my children and grandchildren in the next month or so. I'm also looking forward to my next cup of tea! -Susan Levine, Monrovia, Calif.It is easy to get swept up in the doom and gloom which permeates the media and online environment. Having lived in Ukraine, [I feel that] the war there is another source of potential despair. Escaping from a victim mentality starts with gratitude: Every night before I go to sleep, I name at least three big or little things I am thankful for on that day. -Douglass Teschner, West Lebanon, N.H. I read a single poem every morning. There is hope in the verse or between the lines, something else to drift on, beyond the headlines. -Mark Karason, Pittsburgh, Pa. Music soothes and energizesMusic in particular kickstarts me and really helps me articulate my feelings in both subconscious and conscious ways. I like to have active listening sessions throughout the day. But what helps me the most is listening to music in bed in the early morning before doing anything else. It puts my mind in a place of zen and allows me to be the best version of myself that day to radiate positive energy not only within, but to the surrounding world as well. -Sean Nguyen, Seattle, Wash.My favorite technique for getting happy is definitely playing loud techno music (or other very rhythmic dance songs), and freestyle dancing in my living room. -Robin McMillan, North Port, Fla. Mother Nature and her creatures are there for youI snuggle with my precious rescue cat Tobago and give her belly rubs and listen to her purr contentedly. I feel stress melting away and joy and optimism filling my heart. Months after the loss of Joey, my cat companion of 16 years, a friend took me to Waterville Humane Society. I was overwhelmed until a sweet black and white cat grabbed me and wouldn't let go. She helped me heal and helped my husband and me survive the pandemic. There's just one thing I don't know: who rescued who. -Jules Hathaway, Veazie, Maine When I'm feeling stressed, I take a walk outside in the sun or in a green space like a park or a forest. Despite the noise in my head, the sounds of nature, including those of birds, wind and rain, comfort me. -Whayoung Cha, Seoul, South KoreaEarly spring walk under blooming cherry trees with daughter Analesa, beloved pup Rosko and warmth of the sun on my face. -Cassandra Zimmerman, Portland, Ore.Laughing and playing ukulele with friends. Planting native plants and taking photos of all the pollinators that come to them. -Rosemary Woodel, Athens, Ga. The way I stay optimistic is waking up early to watch the sunrise and meditate on where I find light in the darkness. There are great things of beauty and peace in this world. -Michelle Middleton, Reno, Nev.For 30 years, I have volunteered with a nonprofit whose mission is to teach gardening to home gardeners throughout our community. I feel constantly renewed by the generosity and energy of the people I volunteer with. While I often feel overwhelmed by the magnitude and variety of troubles in our world, I am also mindful of the abundant blessings that fill my life. I cannot stop war or famine on a global scale, but I can teach a family how to grow food — and flowers. -Robbie Cranch, Fresno, Calif.I find my source of joy in nature. I salute the sun every morning and affirm the blessings of the five elements: the earth, space, sun, air and water. When I recognize that my body was born from these five elements, I feel a deep kinship with nature, our womb. I talk to the trees, recognizing their generosity and strength. -Pankaja Cauligi, Mysore, IndiaA glance at sunlight through a leaf, or dew on the grass will send me a charge of energy that lifts my spirit. I am in my 50s now, and have learned how to rebalance, to hit the reset button when patterns became unsustainable. I garden, and learned that life is very much like gardening. That pain, like dirt, is invaluable to growth. That insect pests and garden weeds, like illnesses and bad choices, are things to look out for, to understand and to manage. We can't keep them out completely and simple routines work well enough. -June Pham, Sacramento, Calif. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 07:00:00 EST",89d3825d4a0214bf244e05c5f811188e
1942,Mass. guardsman arrested in leak of classified military documents,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/13/ap-sources-fbi-wants-to-speak-with-mass-guardsman-in-leaks-probe,The Biden administration has scrambled for days to contain the fallout from the leaked information.,"Updated April 13 at 6:16 p.m.WASHINGTON (AP) — A Massachusetts Air National Guard member was arrested Thursday in connection with the disclosure of highly classified military documents about the Ukraine war and other top national security issues, an alarming breach that has raised fresh questions about America's ability to safeguard its most sensitive secrets.The guardsman, an IT specialist identified as 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, was taken into custody without incident after FBI officers converged on his Massachusetts home. He is to be charged under a provision of the Espionage Act that makes it a crime to remove or transmit classified national defense information, Attorney General Merrick Garland said.Garland did not reveal a possible motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat room where the documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by bravado than ideology.While Thursday's arrest was a pivotal moment in an investigation into the highest-profile intelligence leak in years, the military and Justice Department were still scrutinizing how sensitive government secrets shared in a chat room ended up circulating around the world. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect is bound to raise questions about how such a profound breach, one that the Pentagon termed a “very serious risk to national security,” could have been caused by such a young, low-ranking service member.“We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. He referred all questions about the investigation to the Justice Department.Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs.In that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks, a defense official told the Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Hours after the arrest, Rep. Mike Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement pledging to “examine why this happened, why it went unnoticed for weeks, and how to prevent future leaks.”Teixeira, who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts at the time heavily armed tactical agents took him into custody, is due to have his initial court appearance in Massachusetts on Friday. It was not immediately clear if Teixeira had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf, and a phone message left at a number believed to belong to his mother was not immediately returned.Some local veterans have reacted with shock and dismay at the involvement of a local airman. Donald Ellis, an Air Force veteran of the Korean War who lives in Sagamore Village, told CAI that leaks like this put service members’ safety at risk.“All of the people that we have serving around the world that are either in National Guard units, regular units, or that served — men, women — they just now become a real serious target,” Ellis said.U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Marine veteran who represents Massachusetts in Congress, told GBH News he wants answers on how this happened.""The Pentagon is going to need to explain how a junior enlisted National Air Guardsman has access to Ukranian war plans being briefed to the joint chiefs of staff at top secret level,"" Auchincloss said.The Biden administration has scrambled to contain the potential diplomatic and military fallout from the leaks since they were first reported last week, moving to assure allies and assess the scope of damage. Pentagon officials have expressed alarm about the disclosures, but President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Ireland earlier Thursday, said “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.”The classified documents — which have not been individually authenticated by U.S. officials — range from briefing slides mapping out Ukrainian military positions to assessments of international support for Ukraine and other sensitive topics, including under what circumstances Russian President Vladimir Putin might use nuclear weapons.There’s no clear answer on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.The leak is believed to have started on a site called Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games and where Teixeira is believed to have posted for years about guns, games and his favorite memes — and, according to some chatting with him, closely guarded U.S. secrets.The investigative website Bellingcat and The New York Times first publicly identified Teixeira, minutes before federal officials confirmed he was a subject of interest in the investigation. They reported tracking profiles on other more obscure sites linked to Teixeira.In previous Associated Press stories, the leaker was identified as “the O.G.” by a member of the online chat group where Teixeira and others have posted for years. The member of the chat group declined to give his name to the AP, citing concerns for his personal safety.The chat group, called “Thug Shaker Central,” drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite types of guns and also shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also included a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In that discussion, “the O.G.” would for months post material that he said was classified — originally typing it out with his own notations, then a few months ago switching to posting images of folded-up papers because he felt his writings weren’t being taken seriously, the person said.Discord has said it was cooperating with law enforcement.There are only a few ways the classified information that was leaked could have been accessed. Typically in classified briefings with slides like those that were placed on Discord, the information is shared electronically. That can be done either through secure computer terminals where users gain access based on their credentials or through tablets that are distributed for briefings and collected later. If the slides need to be printed out instead, they can only be sent to secured printers that are able to handle classified documents — and that keep a digital record of everyone who has requested a printout.For those with a security clearance, their handling of classified material is based largely on training and trust that they will safeguard the information.“When you join the military, depending on your position, you may require a security clearance,” Ryder said. “And if you are working in the intelligence community, and you require a security clearance, you’re going to go through the proper vetting.”Ryder said each service member who obtains a clearance signs a non-disclosure agreement and is trained on the military’s strict guidelines for handling classified material. The leaks were “a deliberate criminal act, a violation of those guidelines.”SeparatorAssociated Press writers Michelle R.

7243,'A huge injustice': Worcester denies several small nonprofits ARPA funding,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/29/a-huge-injustice-worcester-denies-several-small-nonprofits-arpa-funding,The city recently announced which organizations it's awarding the federal pandemic relief money to.,"Nonprofit leaders and local activists in Worcester say the city’s process for awarding federal COVID-19 relief funding to community groups has been inequitable, arguing that a significant chunk of the money is going to large organizations that already have sufficient support.Late last year, the city of Worcester accepted applications from local nonprofits and other organizations for about $10 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, meant to address issues like food insecurity in communities most impacted by the pandemic.City Manager Eric Batista, who’s overseeing all ARPA decisions, previously told GBH News that Worcester’s application review process would prioritize smaller organizations that have struggled in the past to secure grant funding. But although some of the ARPA money recently went to newer groups trying to expand, others were left out — an exclusion nonprofit leaders worry comes at the expense of the people, often of color, who would benefit from their services. “This is what the system keeps doing,” said Derrick Kiser, who did not receive any ARPA money for his nonprofit Fresh Start, which provides mental health counseling to at-risk youth and young adults. “The same system continues to feed the same organizations and the same people.”According to a GBH News review of publicly available tax data, more than 60% of the total $11.7 million in ARPA money for projects and programming was awarded to larger, more established organizations with at least $400,000 in annual funding.In an interview, Batista argued the city carefully considered all of the 140 applications and awarded the money fairly to a diverse array of groups. He said organizations that didn’t receive any funding will have opportunities in the future to secure city grants.Worcester received $146 million in ARPA funds in 2021. Then-City Manager Edward Augustus appointed residents to committees that would review applications for some of the funding. At the urging of local activists, the city held multiple rounds of community outreach to seek feedback on how to make the awarding process fair and equitable, then hosted workshops to walk prospective applicants through the process. When Kiser applied in the fall last year, he saw the ARPA money as an opportunity to expand his nonprofit Fresh Start, which has served more than 300 people since its founding in 2018. Kiser has used his experience as a former Worcester gang leader to help formerly incarcerated people assimilate back into society and sway youth to leave gangs. But his annual budget has usually been no more than $150,000, which makes it hard for him to broaden his reach. With the help of the Seven Hills Foundation, Kiser filled out three separate lengthy applications for the ARPA money to help fund different programs at his nonprofit. Each application was for $250,000, the maximum organizations could request for a programming initiative. Although he’s struggled in the past to secure other city grants, Kiser said city officials had told him Fresh Start was the exact type of nonprofit they’d prioritize for pandemic relief money.“We would use that money getting two case managers to help assist [clients], provide them with life skills, communication skills, financial literacy ... de-escalation skills,” Kiser said. “And then literally transportation,” bringing them to jobs.But the city rejected all of his applications with no explanation why.Charles Luster also was hopeful. His organization, 2Gether We Eat, employs hydroponic farming to provide fresh produce to lower-income families across the Worcester area. But Luster said although the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce completed his application for him, he was also denied funding.So was Dan Ford, whose nonprofit trains homeless and other underprivileged young people how to restore cars so they can pursue that work as a stable career. Ford previously tried to convert a vacant Worcester manufacturing building into a youth community and vocational hub, known as The Bridge. But after Ford lost out on a bid to purchase the building, he settled on a new plan to expand his auto repair shop into a job training center with apartments for homeless youth.“I know what it is to sleep in an alleyway overnight, freezing cold with a leather jacket and some jeans on,” said Ford, who spent about a decade in out and out homelessness while growing up in Worcester.He thought the ARPA funding could help jumpstart his project, so he hired an experienced grant writer to help him apply. He said he was disappointed but not surprised when he received his rejection letter from Worcester in February.“It’s business as usual for [the] city of Worcester. ... It’s a slap in the face,” Ford said. “It’s pure neglect of a community.” Nelly Medina, a local community organizer who founded the social justice nonprofit Free Worcester, said the ARPA funding decisions exemplify the city’s favoritism of deep-pocketed organizations over small, younger ones often led by people of color. Medina believes Worcester’s marginalized residents lose out when the smaller organizations representing them aren’t given a chance. “The grassroots efforts that are coming from the people on the ground are the ones that are scoffed at,” said Medina, whose group did not apply for ARPA funding. “These organizations that were looked over are some of the most respected in the community. ... It’s a huge injustice.”In a February memo to City Council, Worcester City Manager Eric Batista said his administration received over 140 applications requesting more than a combined $40 million in funding, far more than what was allotable. In response, Batista said he slightly increased the ARPA money available for the applicants “to provide additional funding in support of these critical projects and programs.”Still, considering the high demand for the money, nonprofit leaders and activists question why so much of it went to larger organizations with deep budgets. For example, UMass Chan Medical School has received hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and research funding in recent years but was awarded $225,000 in ARPA money for its Lifeline for Kids program, which helps children recover from trauma.And Worcester Community Action Council, which works to address poverty across the region, received the maximum $250,000 in ARPA programming money even though the organization secured more than $40 million in total funding in 2022.Worcester Community Action Council Executive Director Marybeth Campbell told GBH News she agrees with people’s frustration about the ARPA decisions. In fact, she considered not applying for the money because her organization already benefits from being large and well-established. However, she ended up submitting an application to use the ARPA money for a universal basic income pilot program, in which 50 families will receive direct cash payments for a few years.Officials at UMass Chan deferred to the city for comments about the ARPA funding decisions. Batista and Worcester Chief Development Officer Peter Dunn said the ARPA review committee appropriately accounted for the size and background of applicants. They added the city tried to award organizations the amount of money they asked for, as long as it didn’t significantly exceed their current budgets.“Let’s say if the organization has an annual budget of $50,000 and they request $250,000, then maybe that impacted them in terms of the realisticness of being able to accomplish that and manage that amount of money,” Dunn said.Activists and nonprofit leaders said these doubts about smaller organizations’ ability to manage grant funding are typical among Worcester officials and the greater philanthropic community.But the ARPA money is meant to be used creatively and has more flexible requirements, said Ben Wood, a senior director with Boston-based Health Resources in Action, which works to make philanthropy more fair. He noted that if the city had doubts about some applicants’ capacity to manage money, it could have hired a consultant to help them.Instead, Wood and activists said Worcester’s consideration of the size of applicants’ budgets could have resulted in larger organizations with deeper pockets automatically qualifying for more money over smaller nonprofits. Some city councilors agreed Worcester officials didn’t take advantage of an opportunity to use the ARPA money for organizations that usually struggle to receive funding.“The process wasn’t set up to be equitable,” City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj said. “It creates a mistrust between community and our local government.”She and Councilor Khrystian King said city officials’ next step should be to review and analyze the ARPA decision-making process to avoid the same pattern with future grant money. Haxhiaj added the city needs to “remedy some of the hurt and harm that was caused.”",Local,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:59:55 EST",98ccfbb1122dd9e96761ab9bb3896302
2903,Healey's proposed budget a boon to education and the environment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/healeys-proposed-budget-a-boon-to-education-and-the-environment,Moves to safeguard funds from the 'millionaire's tax'.,"Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday filed a $55.5 billion state budget that proposes a major boost for environmental and energy agencies, locks in tuition rates for Massachusetts students at state universities, and provides free phone calls for people in state prisons. “Today, we wanted to present a budget that will set Massachusetts up for success by lowering costs, growing our economy and delivering on the promise of our people,” Healey said. “Together, we’re putting forth ambitious goals and historic, significant investments.” Healey’s budget for the 2024 fiscal year would increase spending by about 4% over this year’s budget, and it creates a dedicated trust fund for revenue from the state’s new tax on incomes over $1 million. Voters approved that tax at the ballot last November, and the money it generates is dedicated to education and transportation causes. Healey is planning to split $1 billion in millionaire’s tax revenue roughly evenly between education and transportation, with a substantial chunk of it — $360 million — going towards higher education. “Our public higher ed grads, they’re our future teachers and nurses and business owners and accountants and entrepreneurs,” said Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, a Salem State University graduate. “The majority of folks graduating from our public higher ed institutions, they stay right here in the commonwealth.” Healey is proposing to use $59 million of the millionaire’s tax money for what she’s calling “tuition stabilization” in the public higher education system — in-state undergraduates at the UMass campuses and state universities would pay the same tuition rates throughout their four years, rather than facing annual increases. UMass President Marty Meehan said the tuition certainty ""will help our students and their families plan for the cost of a UMass education while encouraging more students to finish their degree in four years, both of which will result in a more affordable degree.""Other goals Healey has in mind for the surtax revenue include reducing waitlists for child care subsidies, expanding early college programs, creating a new grant to help fund municipal transportation projects, and stepping up investments in highway bridge preservation. Healey also wants to steer some of this money to regional transit authorities and to the MBTA, where it will help cover start-up costs for a means-tested fare program to make the T less expensive for people with lower incomes. Healey’s budget also: Requires the Department of Correction to provide up to 1,000 minutes a month of free phone calls, estimated to cost $20 million. Lawmakers advanced no-cost calls legislation last year, but couldn’t get former Gov. Charlie Baker on board.Increases funding for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs by 24%, including money for 240 new staff members. The major funding hike prompted Sen. Mike Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy and Utilities Committee, to call Healey's plan ""the best executive branch budget I've ever seen"" and ""a leap over anything a governor has proposed before."" Includes $324 million for the emergency assistance family shelter program, a 48% increase. The Healey administration says the program is expected to serve 338 new families a month in fiscal 2024. Delivers on a promise she made in her inaugural address by including $20 million to make community college free for eligible students age 25 and older. State financial aid already exists to defray the cost of community college, and Healey’s office says the MassReconnect scholarships “would offer students last-dollar financial support to cover the cost of tuition, fees, books and supplies as well as provide funding for career and wraparound support services to encourage retention and degree completion.” Alongside her budget, Healey also formally filed the $742 million tax-break package she announced Monday and a bill to add a dedicated housing secretary in her cabinet. Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Healey’s budget shows the state remains in a strong financial condition, giving the administration high marks for its tax relief plan, early education investments and what he called a “transparent approach to tracking and using surtax revenue.” The Raise Up Massachusetts Coalition, which campaigned for the surtax, said Healey deserves credit for making sure that money is spent as intended on education and transportation. The coalition has knocked Healey's proposal to reform the estate tax and reduce the tax rate on short-term capital gains, assets held for a year or less. ""While the Governor’s budget proposes several meaningful new initiatives, it doesn't come close to making the investments necessary to address our workforce challenges, tackle our broken childcare system, end the housing affordability crisis, or fix the MBTA and build a 21st century statewide transportation system,"" the coalition said in a statement.Healey’s budget represents a starting point in a process that will stretch for months. The House, in mid-April, will rewrite her plan to reflect its own priorities and add in local earmarks for representatives’ districts. The Senate will follow suit, debating and passing its own budget ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, and the two branches will iron out their differences in closed-door negotiations with the goal of agreeing on a final state budget by the Jul. 1 start of the new fiscal year.For the past several years, talks have dragged past that deadline, and the state has relied on temporary budgets to keep government running.",Politics,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 18:06:02 EST",47b1e64f078592d625adadb3ab918619
5717,Cambridge to launch external review of police department after shooting of Sayed Faisal,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/17/cambridge-to-launch-external-review-of-police-department-after-shooting-of-sayed-faisal,"Review will examine the fatal encounter as well as what changes to police training, policies and protocols could prevent such incidents.","Cambridge officials announced Friday the city hired an outside agency to conduct an independent review of the fatal shooting of Sayed Faisal by Cambridge police, as well as a review of what changes to police training, policies and protocols could prevent similar incidents in the future.A Cambridge police officer shot and killed Faisal on Jan. 4 after they say he approached officers with a knife. The incident has resulted in protests and multiple lengthy community meetings. In response, city officials have pledged to implement body cameras for police and look at alternative responses to 911 calls. “Following the tragic police shooting of Arif Sayed Faisal, I have been committed to charting a path forward by working with the Police Commissioner and City department heads to evaluate our existing services and implement the six recommendations outlined by the City Council that will strengthen our overall safety and support for the Cambridge community,” City Manager Yi-An Huang said in a press release announcing the move on Friday. “Bringing on PERF is one of several commitments we are in the process of implementing and they have a strong record on police reform and helping departments make meaningful changes.”The independent review will be conducted by a team at the Washington, D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum that will include both law enforcement officials and civilian members, including one who specializes in officer-involved shooting investigations, according to the press release. Part of the review will involve interviews with those involved in Cambridge’s emergency response, such as dispatchers and trainers. Barbara Dougan, legal director for the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was cautiously optimistic about the announcement. “It may turn out to be a good thing if they are willing to look at this beyond the confines of your traditional policing analysis. If they’re willing to be visionary and explore alternative ways of responding to an incident where someone is in the throes of a mental health crisis,” Dougan said. “If instead, they limit themselves to kind of the traditional analysis, they may not end up with anything that, at least from our perspective, is that much more helpful.”Dougan emphasized that the external review will have no effect on the judicial inquest, an independent investigation that began last month to determine whether there’s probable cause that the officer who shot Faisal committed a crime. That investigation is being conducted at the request of the Middlesex district attorney's office and involves the DA's office, Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the DA's office and the Cambridge Police.“[PERF’s independent review] will help us continue to learn and grow from the January 4th fatal shooting, particularly from the lens of our policies and procedures,” Police Commissioner Christine Elow said in the release. “Additionally, we expect they will help us with recommendations on less-than-lethal alternatives, how we could evolve the department and city’s capacity for alternative responses to mental health crisis’; and identify new or enhanced prospective training opportunities that would support safe, effective crisis response services to residents with behavioral health challenges. Ensuring that our officers and staff receive training that is consistent with national best practices will enhance the safety of our residents and officers, and help promote trust within the community.”Cambridge has separately allocated $3 million for the creation of a new community safety department outside of the police department, formed at the recommendation of a task force in 2021 that would be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals to respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The department’s interim director says they're planning to have responders from the new department begin responding to 911 calls in the fall of this year.",Local,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 16:06:25 EST",3449f2afee676167b49eb851420bfc58
4569,Why one man says 'speaking' for the trees can address inequity in Boston,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/28/why-one-man-says-speaking-for-the-trees-can-address-inequity-in-boston,"Differing tree coverage across the city tells ""a history of systemic racism.""","On Arbor Day, we are encouraged to plant and celebrate trees, one of our most important resources. When you think about trees, a few things probably come to mind: the bristling of their leaves in the wind, the crunching of their branches when they're on the ground, the feeling you get when you're surrounded by them — which can be rare in a city like Boston. But what does it mean to ""speak"" for trees? ""I'm a big fan of Dr. Seuss and 'The Lorax.' And in the book 'The Lorax,' the Lorax sort of says at a certain point, 'Stop cutting down my trees. I speak for the trees, for they have no tongues.' He doesn't say because they have no voice. The trees actually do have a voice. They just say things in ways that we don't necessarily hear,"" said David Meshoulam, executive director and co-founder of the advocacy group Speak for the Trees. ""And it's time that we come together, building community around, speaking together in one voice for the trees.""Meshoulam joined several volunteers at Kevin Fitzgerald Park in Mission Hill for a recent clean up ahead of Arbor Day. Last year, the group planted about 20 trees. This year, they came back to mulch, water and check in on those same trees, as well as replace the trees that didn't survive with four new ones.One volunteer, Rachel, reflected on the healing power of nature as she pulled weeds.""In the city there are so many cars and never nature,"" she said. ""Being locked up with COVID, you know, no one really got to come out and enjoy. And now we're back out. So this is relaxing.""Mission Hill is home to Northeastern's student population, as well as longstanding Black and Latino communities in the neighborhood. It also has fewer trees than some other neighborhoods.""Drive from West Roxbury out to Mission Hill and you'll see the difference,"" Meshoulam explained. ""And that is not accidental, right? That is a history of systemic racism. It's a history of redlining, disinvestment.""The city is working to address that historic disinvestment. In September, Boston announced a new forestry division and released its Urban Forest Plan. That analysis states that 27% of Boston is covered by trees, but that varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. Just 7% of East Boston is covered by trees, while 44% is covered in Jamaica Plain. Mission Hill, where this recent cleanup was held, falls about in the middle with 25% tree coverage.The city council and Meshoulam recognize the importance of centering equity with new efforts, because trees are not just about visual appeal, they also provide health benefits and protection from the changing climate.""Everyone understands they provide shade, right? On a hot day you want to stand under a tree,"" Meshoulam said. ""But they also absorb air pollutants, right? So they reduce risks of asthma. They mitigate against stormwater flooding, they improve mental health, they reduce violence. They do all these amazing things.""Those issues were illuminated in 2020 when Boston proposed to cut down more than 100 trees lining nearby Melnea Cass Boulevard in Roxbury to widen the roadway. The city scrapped that plan months later, after the organization Friends of Melnea Cass Boulevard pushed back, with the support of Speak for the Trees. At the same time, tree preservation contends with the city's ever-growing need for development in the form of new housing. ""This is becoming one of the least affordable cities to live in. How do we deal with that crisis? We have people living on the street or who can't afford to stay in the city, right?"" Meshoulam said. ""And that might involve removing some trees and replanting. But it can't be, I don't know, Paul Bunyan coming through and just cutting down every tree.""Meshoulam also said volunteering provides an opportunity for residents to learn more about their environment and connect with nature. He believes everyone has a story or a memory about a tree. ""I'm Jewish and my parents are from Israel. And there was an effort to plant trees in Israel to connect Jews from abroad back to the home country, as they call them. And when a baby was born, they would often — a grandmother or something would buy a tree for her, for the grandchild,"" he explained. ""So there's a tree for me planted somewhere, somewhere in Israel.""He's never seen it, and doesn't even know if it survived. But he has the memory.Walking around Fitzgerald Park, he hopes future generations will have their own stories about the pines, plums, redbuds, maples and dogwoods there.

7460,Report: Mass. ranks most expensive for older people living alone,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/22/report-mass-ranks-most-expensive-for-older-people-living-alone,A new study shows Massachusetts’ high rents drive up the costs for adults over 65 living alone.,"New data suggests that Massachusetts is the most expensive state for older people living alone, meaning they’re more likely to face economic insecurity than older singles in any other state. Jan Mutchler, director of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston and creator of the Elder Index, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the results of the study. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: First, can you tell us a bit more about the Elder Index — what it is, what it measures and how it’s calculated?Jan Mutchler: Of course. The Elder Index is a measurement of how much it takes for older singles and couples to live independently in their own homes. We generate a bare-bones budget. It’s a very stripped-down budget, only covers housing, food, travel — and not the fun kind of travel, just getting around to the doctors and grocery store and travel expenses — medical expenses, and a small additional amount for added things like home goods and things like that. So we calculate this bare-bones lifestyle county by county for the entire United States. And we’ve been doing this here at UMass Boston Gerontology for about 12 years. Rath: As we mentioned, Massachusetts ranks first in the most expensive states for older people living alone, even ahead of New York and California. Do we have a sense of why? And also could you put that in perspective for us, give us a sense of scale? Mutchler: A lot of times, in these conversations, it’s helpful to think about the values for older renters in good health because many people do rent. It’s also a common transition as people get older for them to move out of owned homes and into a renter situation. So looking at those numbers, the value of the Elder Index for Massachusetts singles is just over $37,000 a year. That compares to the average U.S. value of about $29,000 a year. So you’re looking at $8,000 a year more being required for older singles to stay in their homes in Massachusetts. As you said, that is higher than Hawaii, New York and California — it’s the highest in the country. Rath: To make an obvious point, that’s a huge deal if you’re living on a fixed income. Tell us a bit more about this slice of the older population we’re talking about: people who are living alone. Do the demographics of this group, say the measures of race or gender, do they track with the general population? Or are they more predominantly one thing or another?Mutchler: When you’re looking at the older population living alone, you are disproportionately looking at white women. That’s not to say that they’re all white women by any means — but essentially, women do live longer than men, so the older we’re looking in the age range, the more women we’re seeing relative to men. White people also have higher longevity, longer life on average, than many other race and ethnic groups. They do live longer than African American elders, for instance.However, a lot of the reasons we see a disproportionate share of white people living alone relative to other groups is that other groups — the Latinx, Black and Asian populations — are more likely to be living with their children. Many of them do live alone, but a larger share lives with other people than is the case in the white population.Rath: Do we have a sense that this group, the older people who are living alone, is growing as we have an aging population?Mutchler: Yes. Over many, many decades, we can track the growth in the percentage of older people living alone. A lot of that is a function of outliving spouses. It’s also a function of many people not forming marital relationships at all. It’s a function of a sort of cultural norm where independence is highly valued in many groups; a lot of people feel that they should be living alone, that that’s expected, and that’s a desired outcome for them. But that does create these financial problems that we’re documenting with the Elder Index. It’s expensive to live all by oneself and cover all of your expenses, and the older you get, the higher those expenses may be. You can experience an increase in the health care expenses as you get older, and you may require more medications, more doctor’s visits and that kind of thing.Again, our report focuses largely on people who are renters. Especially in Massachusetts, but all the way across the country, the cost of renting has just spiraled and has hit older people very hard — as anyone who’s renting. But it has had a huge impact on older people. Rath: What you just said makes this next question even harder, and that’s: What can be done about this? I mean, this ties into things like housing prices, which are hard to deal with, and we’re dealing with it in a lot of ways across the board. Are there any kinds of interventions, policies that can help alleviate these burdens for older people living alone?Mutchler: There are things that that we can do, as a society and as a state, and things that families and individuals can do. The challenge to some extent is that what we're talking about is: a lot of the people who have incomes falling below the Elder Index are people who used to be middle class. They used to be okay, but with time, as they age and have lost a spouse ... and their income really has shrunk, and they’re no longer able to really cover this bare-bones budget that we calculate through the Elder Index. Some of those people will have incomes so low that they may be eligible for things like SNAP benefits, subsidies for health insurance, subsidized housing, things of that nature. Many of them will not have incomes that are low enough. They’ll be too low to really support an adequate lifestyle, but they won’t be low enough for some of the big programs that we’re aware of. They might be eligible for other programs, like fuel assistance and other sorts of supports. Everybody — whether their income is very low, or they’re just struggling in that middle place below the Elder Index but above the poverty line — can find out about programs that they might be eligible for through their senior centers. Every community in Massachusetts has a council on aging, and they can refer you to somebody who would give you information about what you might be eligible for if you’re struggling.",Local,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:38:19 EST",80b6cd78acdeb8ac0eaf25486abd3380

Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.We are quickly moving toward springtime. Could Dave talk about when is the best time to clean up the garden in spring to help support pollinators and garden health? —Laura, via emailUntil nights are a bit warmer, pollinators can lay dormant in plants, Epstein said. Supporting them is easy: Wait a bit longer to clean things up.“The longer you can tolerate waiting, the better it is for the pollinators,” Epstein said. “Until it really warms up, until we have nights which are well into the 40s, which probably doesn't happen until later on in April, some of the pollinators are still sleeping.”For instance: People who have perennials with long stocks in their yards often provide a winter home for solitary bees and other insects.“If you cut those down and chop them up and throw them away, you may be damaging the home for the little bee which was hanging out there all winter, or other sort of beneficial insects,” Epstein said. “So that's why you want to leave it as long as possible. I have to admit I leave some of my garden, but some I’ve got to uncover because things are emerging. So try to do as long as you can.”Is it cold out lately, or is it just me being a baby? —Morning Edition co-host Jeremy SiegelAfter unseasonably warm weather for most of the winter, Epstein said he welcomes 40-degree highs in March. People sometimes have odd expectations for March weather, he said.“I think our expectation of this month is so unrealistic,” he said. “Everyone's like, ‘it’s not supposed to be this cold.’”Looking ahead at the forecast, Epstein said Boston-area residents can expect highs in the 40s for the next week, with intermittent breeze and clouds, perhaps some precipitation. “There might be some rain, there might be a little snow. It's what March does,” Epstein said. He offered some advice or anyone who may be weary of March. “It's what early spring is. I'm not telling people what to do, but if you embrace it and look at it and go: ‘this is the transition, this is the light growing, in another couple of weeks we're going to be at 12 hours of daylight,"" he said. ""Birds are out there making the noise in the morning. If you look at the maple trees, they're beginning to open up, the red maples. The sap is flowing, small little bugs are starting to emerge. I mean, that's early spring. And if it happens slowly, that's great because that's what nature wants.”",Local,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 11:48:25 EST",a7c5be5ae283074debf757603ab675d9

And with cannabis having surpassed cranberries as the top crop in Massachusetts last fall, the legal industry here just keeps on budding. That hasn't come without challenges, especially when it comes to ensuring equity in the industry. But with a new cannabis reform law on the books and a new Cannabis Control Commission chair in place, there is an opportunity to turn over a new leaf, so to speak. Shannon O'Brien, chairperson of the Cannabis Control Commission, joined Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to discuss the state of the industry. This transcript has been lightly edited.Paris Alston: You are making your Morning Edition debut since you stepped into the role last fall. How have things been going, and what are your goals for the commission and the industry? Shannon O'Brien: Well, you know, this has been a steep learning curve for me. I've been the state treasurer, so I've run a large state organization with a $75 million budget. And we ran the lottery, so obviously, you know, running something that had previously been illegal but then has been incorporated into cities and towns and neighborhoods across Massachusetts. So there's a little bit of overlap there. But this is something very new to me, a sort of independent agency. And I'm trying to sort of take an assessment. I have spent the last seven months meeting with stakeholders, assessing whether or not we have resources in the right place to meet our mission. And front and center, one of the first things that I think we need to do is after five years of legalized recreational cannabis, how do we keep the promise of promoting equity to those people who have been disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs? We've had 900 people go through our social equity program. We've only had about 50 people who've gone through those programs or who qualify under that program who've actually become licensees. Now, there are many other ways that you can expand economic empowerment to people through the benefits of bringing a billion-dollar industry into Massachusetts. But that's my first priority: How do we now assess where we are, How do we make sure that as the market is becoming saturated, how do we make sure that we still maintain that promise? And then how do we rethink what equity is? And my other true priority is research. Massachusetts is the hub of education, of health care, of biotech. We have great researchers here like Staci Gruber. And we need to leverage that. So I think that figuring out, truly, what some therapies are, getting research-based proof of of how cannabis can help people. And then finally, making sure that we look at how do we regulate our industry? Can we reduce the red tape to help businesses continue to thrive in Massachusetts without leaving out public safety? We want to maintain public safety and reduce regulation. That's a mouthful. Alston: Certainly a lot to get done there. And we know that the cannabis reform law that's in place is intended to help accomplish some of those things. Where is the commission on reviewing and implementing those new regulations? O'Brien: So right now we have three different working groups. One group is looking at social consumption. Some persons may live in public housing, where cannabis is still illegal. Those people cannot enjoy the benefits or the entertainment, if you will, of utilizing cannabis either medicinally or recreationally. So ensuring that everyone has equal access to that social consumption is something that one of our groups is looking at, and determining how they can work with municipalities to make sure that, one, we create that access to the product, but two, we maintain a public health and safety. Another group is looking at the host community agreements. The HCAs are literally contracts that the communities signed with the licensees that say we will allow you to come to our town. We'll go through that process. And this is what we expect in return for allowing you to come to our community. And then finally, the group that I'm on, which is social equity, is: How do we continue to incorporate that equity lens into granting those licenses to cannabis applicants? Alston: And I'm assuming putting some onus on the host communities as well to make those things a little more accessible for those social equity applicants. O'Brien: Yes, exactly. My particular group, we've engaged a number of different stakeholders. We had an opportunity to speak with a delightful young woman, Payton Shubrick, who is woman of color living out in Springfield. And Payton, frankly, isn't even our so-called social equity program participant. But hearing some of the barriers that she went through to try to stand up her business — and frankly, she has been incredibly successful, has a wonderful retail store out in Springfield. But one of the stories that we had heard is that some communities — and again, communities are looking for revenue. It's understandable that they would want a successful and profitable cannabis business in their town or city. But one of the requirements or one of the ways they measured a successful applicant is an entity that had previous experience in the regulated cannabis market. Well, that obviously tilts the playing field towards what they call MSOs, multistate operators, those sort of deep-pocketed companies that invest in cannabis across the country. From my perspective, having been a state rep, state senator and state treasurer promoting economic opportunity in Massachusetts, I think that this industry should be tilted not towards the big guys, but the smaller entrepreneurs, both persons from different economic empowerment groups, and all groups, smaller entrepreneurs. So looking at what those barriers have been in communities and making sure that we don't tilt that against those equity applicants, and frankly create incentives for communities to not only welcome, but to embrace economic empowerment applicants. Alston: So, Shannon, I know that this is a really pivotal time for the commission. At the same time, there's not a whole lot of trust and confidence in the commission right now, considering some internal things that have been going on, as well as the fact that with those social equity applicants, there's still a small percentage of those who have been able to go through and set up shop. So how do you turn things around and regain that trust? O'Brien: Well, first of all, I'll talk about economic empowerment. And this is something that's very important to me. And the word that I have been using when I talk to staff and when I talk to people on the outside is 'impact.' We spend a lot of money, millions of dollars, running people through these programs. And I want to make sure that the programs that we're running actually match the needs of the people who are seeking either to get into the cannabis industry or find other options for people to enjoy the economic benefits of this industry. So I want us to do basically a 360. What are we doing? Is it impactful? And with the sort of window — the market is saturating, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to get into this market. And businesses are going out of business. They can't compete. Prices are plummeting. So we need to sort of look at both, one, where are we in the market? How can we help our businesses? And how can we sort of rethink what we do for social equity applicants?",Local,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:49:53 EST",140d9607ac2294e0161df3b53566cc8e
4603,Some housing activists disappointed with Healey's choice for housing secretary,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/16/some-housing-activists-disappointed-with-healeys-choice-for-housing-secretary,"The appointee, Ed Augustus, served as Worcester city manager from 2014 to 2022.","Some Massachusetts housing activists say they’re disappointed with Gov. Maura Healey’s appointment of Ed Augustus, who will serve as the state’s first housing secretary in 30 years. Healey revived the position to help address Massachusetts’ spiraling housing crisis. In a statement Monday announcing Augustus’ appointment as leader of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, she credited him with overseeing the development of various new housing complexes while he was Worcester’s city manager from 2014 to 2022. “He left Worcester a stronger city than it was a decade ago, with booming economic development in the downtown and thousands of new housing units,” Healey said. But housing activists in Worcester argue that’s misleading, noting the vast majority of those new apartments have been too expensive for low- to moderate-income renters. They add that housing prices in Worcester soared and homelessness rose to record highs while Augustus ran the city. Today, a year after Augustus stepped down as city manager, nearly 50% of Worcester renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on rent and utilities. Longtime residents are increasingly leaving Worcester because they can no longer find affordable housing in the city. “He was the city manager, the CEO of the city, at a time where his role [was] to organize and oversee the current wave of gentrification that is not benefiting — and is in fact harming and pushing out — the most vulnerable segments of the population,” said Addison Turner, who advocates for homeless people in Worcester. Other Massachusetts housing advocates have applauded Augustus’ appointment, arguing his experience with housing at the local level could prove valuable. “Congratulations, Secretary Augustus!” Rachel Heller, CEO of the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, said in a tweet. “Your experiences in local and state government are vital for developing policies and supports to produce the homes that people, our communities, and the Commonwealth need in order to thrive!”By some estimates, the commonwealth will need as many as 200,000 new residential units by 2030 to address its housing crunch. Building those apartments and houses will involve convincing localities to re-zone for more multifamily housing, a delicate effort that Augustus will lead as housing secretary.Still, activists who specialize in affordable housing say Healey’s choice raises questions about her administration’s housing priorities. Andrea Park, an attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, said state leaders need to focus on creating housing for the lowest-income families, rather than housing in general. “How are we going to create permanent affordability?” Park said. “That includes moving people out of homelessness, out of shelter. So we would put that challenge forth to the new secretary and hope to work with him to really address the crisis.”",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 16:53:28 EST",90ee87aa0c7186b2d6b18fc5d8e2f77e

Our babies are dying. These things can be preventable,” Jessica Paulino, founder of the EMA Project, said on Greater Boston. “I didn’t feel heard in my maternity care and I live in the mecca of health care.”Advocacy group March of Dimes gave the state poor grades for its rate of preterm births, especially among moms of color, and the group is pushing lawmakers to take action by implementing policy changes to help. Advocates met with lawmakers at the State House on Thursday as part of the March of Dimes March for Change, which is a nationwide effort.One policy is the Moms Matter Act, would address maternal mental health and substance abuse issues along with paid leave for pregnancy loss.Paulino was with the group that visited Beacon Hill.

6746,Delivery drivers want protection against heat. But it's an uphill battle,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/20/delivery-drivers-want-protection-against-heat-but-its-an-uphill-battle,"For nearly a decade, Viviana Gonzalez has spent her summers delivering packages for United Parcel Service under sweltering sun in Palmdale, California – in a truck without air conditioning.","For nearly a decade, Viviana Gonzalez has spent her summers delivering packages for United Parcel Service under sweltering sun in Palmdale, California – in a truck without air conditioning.A typical work day means at least 10 hours in and out of one of UPS' brown delivery vehicles, where temperatures in the back, Gonzalez said, at times surpass 150 degrees. Her only relief is a fan that blows hot air into her face.Gonzalez has come to expect waves of nausea and weakness throughout the day. ""We're out there for hours, so you can only think about how much stress we're putting on our bodies,"" Gonzalez said.Delivering packages is a solo task. Sometimes, Gonzalez calls her friends for support while she's on her delivery route, in case her health takes a turn for the worse. Last June, a 24-year-old Palmdale UPS driver named Esteban Chavez was found unconscious in his truck while on his delivery route in Pasadena. Chavez died of sudden cardiac dysfunction, according to the medical examiner's report. Temperatures exceeded 90 degrees that day, and his family believes his heart failure was due to the heat.Another driver, 23-year-old José Cruz Rodriguez, died from a heat-related illness, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, during his UPS delivery shift in Waco, Texas, in August 2021. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against UPS and ultimately settled with the company.Gonzalez often thinks of her 18-year-old son when she's out driving.""What would've happened to him if I had died in the back of the truck?"" Gonzalez said. ""We are putting our lives at risk by delivering in these hot weather conditions. And we're human – we don't know what our body is going to take.""New heat safety measures at UPSConditions are set to change for UPS delivery drivers nationwide. UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents 340,000 UPS workers, negotiated a tentative heat safety agreement in June to install air conditioning systems in all of the company's small package delivery vehicles purchased after Jan. 1, 2024.UPS said it will send the new vehicles to the hottest parts of the U.S. first, when possible. The company has also agreed to add new heat shields and fans in delivery vehicles. The agreement will be finalized once UPS and the Teamsters negotiate a new contract – a process that could lead to the largest strike against a single employer in U.S. history.Teamsters President Sean O'Brien called the heat safety agreement a ""significant step towards a stronger new reality for so many workers and their families."" UPS said in a statement that worker safety ""remains our top priority."" Jim Mayer, a UPS spokesperson, said the company currently supplies its employees with cooling gear. But drivers have to get through this summer's heat waves – mostly without air conditioning.""We're still going to have to live through this peak, but it's almost like a touchdown,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're almost there.""Drivers at UPS competitors also concerned about heat risksOSHA lists mail and package delivery as one of the primary industries where outdoor workers suffer from heat-related illnesses. The agency's work-related injury database shows at least 40 UPS drivers have been hospitalized due to heat-related illness since 2015. It's not just a UPS concern. Drivers working similar jobs for UPS' competitors – including Amazon and FedEx – are also raising alarms about heat on the job as climate change causes temperatures to rise. Both companies said their delivery vehicles are equipped with functioning air conditioning. But drivers Renica Turner and Demetria Forte, who deliver packages for Amazon, as well as Johnathon Ervin, the owner of an Amazon subcontractor, told NPR the air conditioning is often broken in Amazon-branded vans.Most workers at Amazon and FedEx aren't represented by a union – and they aren't even classified as company employees, making it that much harder to demand protections.Amazon workers join the fightLast April, Turner was delivering Amazon packages on a 110-degree day in Victorville, California – northeast of Los Angeles – when her body started to tingle. She thought she might pass out.Amazon said company-branded vehicles have functioning air conditioning, and those without it are immediately grounded. But Turner said the air conditioning and fans in the van weren't working on that day. When she rolled down the windows, hot air drifted inside. She said she let the Amazon dispatcher know about her symptoms. All she got was a 20-minute break.""They never sent no one out to help me with the rest of the route,"" Turner said, referring to the 300 packages she was expected to deliver, at a rate of 25 per hour. ""I had to deliver the rest of that, feeling woozy, feeling numb, and just really overwhelmed."" Turner works for an Amazon subcontractor called Battle Tested Strategies, or BTS. It's one of about 3,000 independent contractors in the e-commerce giant's delivery network – small businesses contracted by Amazon to deliver packages.BTS owner Johnathon Ervin, who leases vans from Amazon, said Amazon regularly fails to fix broken air conditioning in the vehicles. He said it can take weeks, even months, for Amazon to repair the vans.""It's insane that we're forced to drive these vehicles,"" Ervin said. ""We went to Amazon, asked them to retire the vehicles, and it went on deaf ears.""Email communications reviewed by NPR show BTS has reported several cases of malfunctioning air conditioning in leased vehicles. On September 1, 2022, Ervin wrote in an email to Amazon that the air conditioning units in five vans stopped working on that day alone. Similarly, in June 2021, emails show it took weeks for BTS to get air conditioning units fixed, as the subcontractor navigated delays from Amazon's third-party repair companies. An Amazon spokesperson said Amazon is not responsible for delays, adding that subcontractors are in charge of fixing the vans. Turner and 83 of her colleagues unionized with Teamsters and bargained a contract with BTS in April, in large part to push for heat safety measures. It's the first union of its kind in the Amazon delivery network. These newly-unionized drivers have been on strike since late June over Amazon's termination of its contract with BTS. Ervin and the Teamsters union allege Amazon is retaliating against the workers for unionizing; an Amazon spokesperson, however, said the company ended its contract with BTS over unrelated contract breaches.Regarding heat safety, the spokesperson said Amazon adjusted some of its delivery routes last year so drivers can take more breaks to cool down. The burden falls on driversOSHA, the federal agency that oversees workplace safety, has recommendations for how employers should handle heat – but it's still in the process of drafting heat-specific worker protections. This means, currently, the county's biggest delivery companies have no legal obligation to provide nationwide heat protections for drivers.Brenda Jacklitsch, a heat stress expert at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said outdoor workers can experience heat-related illnesses ranging from heat rash and heat cramps to heat stroke.Employers, she said, can schedule the most physically intense work activities for cooler times in the day – and provide air conditioning and fans when possible. ""Even having an air-conditioned vehicle that is pre-cooled is a great way to help cool somebody down during a rest break,"" Jacklitsch said.Jacklitsch added that ""buddy systems"" can help workers look out for one another and monitor symptoms of heat stress. This can be a challenge for drivers who deliver packages on their own.For now, delivery drivers are doing what they can to protect themselves from extreme heat. Forte, another driver who delivers packages for Amazon in Palmdale employed by subcontractor BTS, said Amazon's expectation of 25 to 30 package deliveries per hour puts a strain on her health when temperatures surpass 100 degrees.Forte rotates through different vans for her delivery shifts. She tries to secure a van equipped with working air conditioning when she reports to work in the morning.But she said some days, she's stuck without AC, in which case she pours frozen bottles of water over the van's cooling rack.""(Customers) don't see all of that. They just see, 'Oh, yes, my package is here, great,'"" Forte said. ""They don't see what we go through on a daily basis.""

2134,Brookline and Somerville team up to find ways to buy more from women and people of color,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/07/brookline-and-somerville-team-up-to-find-ways-to-buy-more-from-women-and-people-of-color,The municipalities are launching a major study that they hope will be broadly applicable to Greater Boston communities.,"The city of Somerville and the town of Brookline are teaming up to launch a major study of disparities that prevent minority- and women-owned businesses from getting their fair share of government contracts.The two municipalities will share the costs of the study — which could run as much as a quarter million dollars — and they say that while the recommendations will be unique to each community, the findings should be broadly useable across Greater Boston to help cities and towns expand opportunities for disadvantaged businesses. Funding for the study will come from the federal pandemic relief money.Cities generally use disparity studies to provide legal justification for implementing what effectively serve as affirmative action programs for companies, such as government contracts reserved specifically for businesses that the study found were not getting their fair share of city work.In 2021, Boston released a disparity study showing that 0.4% of prime contracts the city awarded to private enterprises over a five-year period went to Black-owned businesses. In response, Mayor Michelle Wu launched a “sheltered market” program — the first of its kind in the state — reserving certain contracts for women- or minority-owned businesses. In the first three months of that program, the city steered more than $700,000 to two minority-owned firms for cleaning and event management services.Somerville and Brookline issued a joint request Wednesday for a contractor to conduct a disparity study for the two municipalities that will, among other things, “Determine whether a legally defensible basis exists for establishing a race and/or gender conscious contracting program … and the appropriate and most effective parameters of such a program.”Angela Allen, Somerville’s chief procurement officer, said the city is already trying to recruit more minority- and women-owned firms to bid for city contracts, but they often get “far fewer offers than we expect we will.” The real goal to the disparity research is “to lower the barriers to entry to bid on projects,” she said. “A study will help get us a framework and a roadmap to how we go about this.”And she said it made sense to work with Brookline on the project, and to split the costs. “We feel we're like-minded communities. Our administrations are very much in support of this project, so why not do it together?”“We really decided early on is how can we attack this together,” said David Geanakakis, chief procurement officer for the town of Brookline. “There will be separate outcomes distinct to Brookline, distinct to Somerville, but there is enough of a commonality in the whole study process.”And since the two communities mostly have the same purchasing needs and the same pool of potential vendors, it allows them to seek solutions that are applicable to both of them — and, Geanakakis said, to a broader swath of Greater Boston as well.Brookline and Somerville have briefed other local communities on the research plan, he said, and promised to share results and recommendations that could be useful without each municipality having to do its own study. “We really were driven in both of the communities here to do this and frankly, take the lead,"" he said.Luis Quizhpe, Somerville’s strategic planning and equity manager, noted that the project also extends beyond women and people of color to include all “socially disadvantaged individuals.”That language “really kind of broadens how we think of someone who we're trying to help equitably,” he said, because it focuses on who might be facing structural barriers to their success, rather than focusing on categories and descriptions — like “minority” — that essentially define people by how they are disempowered.“I think that that language, albeit small … gives back a sense of self-determination or at least the intent of self-determination,” Quizhpe said.",Local,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 10:29:29 EST",cffbf7a807e608b198ca287122b8adbb
6772,Improved communications at the center of the MBTA’s new safety plan,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/06/improved-communications-at-the-center-of-the-mbtas-new-safety-plan,MBTA General Manager Philip Eng said many of the actions in the new plan are already underway.,"After track workers were almost struck by approaching trains five times in March and April, the Federal Transit Administration required the MBTA to address how it plans to improve employee safety.Those near misses made it clear to the federal oversight agency there was a major communication failure between train dispatchers, operators and crews working on the MBTA’s rights of way. Correcting that deficiency is the central piece of the MBTA’s new safety plan, submitted Monday to the FTA. The federal agency still must approve the plan. The revised plan prioritizes improving communication procedures so that train dispatchers and train operators know exactly where and when crews will be working on repairs to the transit system’s tracks.A pilot program being tested on the Blue Line employs electronic maps to allow dispatchers to track the presence of workers on rights of way in real time. If it proves to be a success, it will be implemented throughout the systemAnother pilot is being tested on the Green Line, where most of the near misses occurred, employs flaggers who alert train operators to the presence of workers on tracks ahead. The plan also addresses problems with radio communications. It seeks to “ensure unambiguous and explicit communication” between flaggers and dispatchers by reviewing and revising the information that should be exchanged during those interactions. And potentially thousands of radios will have to reconfigured with specific channels established to improve communications between workers and supervisors.The proposal submitted Monday was the MBTA's second version of this safety plan. The FTA judged the initial submission in May to be insufficient, as it would take months to enact new protocols and procedures. The FTA cited an imminent danger to workers and required a new plan that would have the MBTA implement corrective actions within 60 days.In a cover letter to the FTA, General Manager Philip Eng said many of the actions in the new plan are already underway, but some will require longer than a 60-day window. After meeting with FTA representatives last week, Eng said both sides agreed that too many changes made too quickly could increase the risk to workers and be counterproductive.Eng has said the FTA’s order to direct the T to resubmit a safety plan was “no big deal’ and normally how the agency interacts with the transit systems it oversees. Eng sees the relationship with the FTA as more cooperative than adversarial, and he welcomes the FTA’s involvement. He says the ultimate goal is enhancing safety which is good not only for T workers, but also the traveling public.",Local,"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 14:22:04 EST",7880ed62b3fef892f4f30f03514a9586
3942,Why is being childfree by choice suddenly so controversial?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/03/20/why-is-being-childfree-by-choice-suddenly-so-controversial,Some people are too invested in denigrating women who choose not to have kids.,"I was in high school when it hit me that I never wanted to have kids. Maybe that anti-maternal instinct would not seem so unusual now, or even back then in some other part of the country. But I grew up in Tennessee, where every young woman’s two-step program was supposed to include marriage and family. I was all in on the Prince Charming fantasy wedding component, but not the birthing part. I kept my errant feelings to myself — ecstatic when I stumbled across a book about women choosing not to have kids. I dogeared the pages, relieved that my feelings were validated.I had great parents and I was lucky enough to have a mother I both loved and admired, and who was well loved by other kids. I should have wanted to embrace the role, but early on I told my mother I realized motherhood was a lifetime job and I didn’t want the job. And I didn’t change my mind later when a serious boyfriend told me not having kids was a deal breaker. You might assume that I hate kids, but no, I enjoy other people’s kids. One of my friends forbade me from reading stories to his daughter because he said I was “raising the bar” by acting out all the characters and rereading the book as many times as she wanted. And I was always the first one volunteering to rock and coo over the newborn kids of my friends. Many of those kids grew up calling me Aunt Callie. So did my real twin niece and nephew, whom I have doted on all their lives.I’m recalling my experiences because recently I’ve been stunned to see how much some people are invested in denigrating women who are childfree by choice. A choice that is none of their business. Chelsea Handler triggered a firestorm of misogynistic fury after a she created a satirical and raunchy sketch for Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show,"" which portrayed her exciting, carefree life as a single woman with no kids. Handler responded to the apoplectic Fox host Tucker Carlson with the question: “Are you really upset about how much freedom I have, or are you upset that you haven’t been able to take it away from me yet?” Handler’s clapback identifies this exchange for what it is: the latest outrage in the culture wars. Childfree by choice, after all, includes choice as the operative word. A 2022 study of 1,500 Michigan adults found the percentage of young people deciding early — as I did — they don’t want kids has risen. What’s more, the study revealed that of the estimated one in five who said no to having kids, most don’t change their minds.The news is full of incidents of neglected and abused children in the custody of people who should never have had them. So, I’m at a loss as to why women making a thoughtful choice not to have kids is threatening. But then again, I’m at also at a loss about why the folks pushing for every woman to give birth — no matter the circumstances — are generally the last ones to fight for resources to care for those children.This Women’s History Month I’m saluting the women who continue to advocate for other women to make the reproductive decisions best for them: those who are wonderful mothers, and those who wisely chose not to be.",Commentary,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 05:00:53 EST",fddca793d84236c391f4ef29e8665e99

As of Friday morning, most of those restrictions are no longer in place.Speed limits remain in effect on Green Lines and the Mattapan Trolley, with trains not exceeding 10-25 miles an hour, depending on the location. Normally speeds vary by line but top out at 40 mph.Agency officials explained that the decision was made following recent track testing and a site visit by the Department of Public Utilities. The agency uses an ultrasonic system to detect track defects that may not be visible to the naked eye — from spacing between the rails being too tight to a slight twist in the rails — and testing from that system showed inconsistencies they needed to follow up on.""This decision that we made yesterday to slow the trains down globally was done out of an abundance of caution for their safety. And that is something right now that we have to remain completely committed to,"" interim MBTA General Manager Jeff Gonneville said at a press conference Friday.Gonneville said he expects inspections to take a couple days. He could not predict when the remaining restrictions would be lifted, because that depends on whether inspectors identify areas of track that need repair.""Frankly, this is all part of ensuring that the T is safe,"" he said. ""Safe for our customers, safe for our employees.""The MBTA has been running trains with speed restrictions over some parts of the system because of track work and safety concerns over months, notably on sections of the Orange Line after they reopened following a 30-day shutdown in August and September. The agency announced other disruptions Friday morning: Shuttle buses replaced the Mattapan trolley along the entirety of its route, from Mattapan Square to Ashmont, until just after 8 a.m. Friday; and a power outage meant Blue Line trains were replaced with shuttle buses between Maverick and Suffolk Downs. On Thursday, the MBTA’s chief safety officer, Ronald Ester Jr., told the MBTA’s board that the Department of Public Utilities, which oversees the MBTA, found a few pressing issues. “The DPU identified several issues that resulted in some immediate action letters being issued to the MBTA,” Ester said. “They were: Priority 1one track conditions, third rail insulators, electrical access boxes on the right of way, headlight operation within the tunnels, PPE compliance and safety briefings.” Commuters Friday mornings responded to the slowdowns with a mixture of frustration and resignation.“I would love to see the T function better because I think it’s important to have a system like this. So many people rely on it,” said Laura Hewlett, on her way to work as a teacher. “I rely on it too. But I’d love to know that it goes faster than me running.

5007,"Fishing ban may only be one step toward preventing king salmon, orca extinctions",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/24/fishing-ban-may-only-be-one-step-toward-preventing-king-salmon-orca-extinctions,"Environmentalists and the fishing industry are going head to head in the courts over a proposed shutdown of one of Alaska's largest fisheries, but it still might not be enough to save king salmon.","The king salmon population in Alaska has dropped 60% since 1984, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. A lawsuit aiming to curb the extinction of the salmon and orcas through limiting human consumption of the fish recently led to the shutdown of one of the largest fisheries in the world. The Wild Fish Conservancy, who filed the lawsuit, argued that the fate of orcas and king salmon were intertwined — the fish, known for their size and high fat content, are the whales' preferred meal — and human consumption leaves little of the food source for the 73 remaining resident orcas off the coast of Seattle.Now, some say halting the fishing of king salmon, also known as Chinook salmon, is only the start of preventing the species' extinction. The other factor? Climate change.Regardless whether king salmon are at risk of extinction because of human fishing or climate change, Corby Kummer, executive director of the Food and Society Policy program at the Aspen Institute, told Boston Public Radio the takeaway is the same: ""We shouldn't be catching and eating king salmon, period.""Over the past 60 years, Alaska's average temperature has increased by about 3 degrees Farenheit. Ocean temperatures have hit record-breaking highs this summer, and the impact of rising sea temperatures can be seen in the salmon, and the people who have traditionally hunted them.The New York Times reported that the famously large fish are smaller than they have ever been, and the drop in population has led to an inability to fish enough of the species to supply the Indigenous communities in Alaska that have fished Chinook calmon for hundreds of years.""Shutting down fishing might not be the answer, because oceans are warming up, and king salmon are disappearing,"" said Kummer. ""There's no particularly good explanation about why they're disappearing, but shutting it down might not be all that great for saving the orcas. And who knows what it's going to do for the king salmon population.""What does this mean for consumers? Here in New England, it's unlikely to make a big difference because wild-caught king salmon is not common here.""Their meat comes at a very high premium, often $30 to $60 a pound. ... It generally appears in Boston stores only in August to October, that's the general time that it's available,"" Kummer explained. ""Very little salmon is wild caught; 97% of the salmon you buy is farmed.""Kummer said while he prefers sockeye salmon for his own cooking — citing both flavor and price — wild salmon as a whole may not be as broadly available as the impacts of climate change continue to amass.""Until I read that sockeye is just as endangered as king [salmon], I'll keep buying sockeye. But now it makes me very leery about wild salmon at all,"" said Kummer.The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is expected to decide what will happen next for Alaskan fisheries and king salmon.",National,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 16:31:19 EST",b97d9a208187ce9b6a490a95ac4e869b

Glass Health is now among a handful of companies who are hoping to use artificial intelligence chatbots to offer services to doctors. These firms maintain that their programs could dramatically reduce the paperwork burden physicians face in their daily lives, and dramatically improve the patient-doctor relationship.""We need these folks not in burnt-out states, trying to complete documentation,"" Paul says. ""Patients need more than 10 minutes with their doctors.""But some independent researchers fear a rush to incorporate the latest AI technology into medicine could lead to errors and biased outcomes that might harm patients.""I think it's very exciting, but I'm also super skeptical and super cautious,"" says Pearse Keane, a professor of artificial medical intelligence at University College London in the United Kingdom. ""Anything that involves decision-making about a patient's care is something that has to be treated with extreme caution for the time being.""A powerful engine for medicinePaul co-founded Glass Health in 2021 with Graham Ramsey, an entrepreneur who had previously started several healthcare tech companies.

When ChatGPT appeared on the scene last year, Paul says, he didn't pay much attention to it.""I looked at it and I thought, 'Man, this is going to write some bad blog posts. Who cares?'"" he recalls.But Paul kept getting pinged from younger doctors and medical students. They were using ChatGPT, and saying it was pretty good at answering clinical questions. Then the users of his software started asking about it.In general, doctors should not be using ChatGPT by itself to practice medicine, warns Marc Succi, a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital who has conducted evaluations of how the chatbot performs at diagnosing patients. When presented with hypothetical cases, he says, ChatGPT could produce a correct diagnosis accurately at close to the level of a third- or fourth-year medical student. Still, he adds, the program can also hallucinate findings and fabricate sources.""I would express considerable caution using this in a clinical scenario for any reason, at the current stage,"" he says.But Paul believed the underlying technology can be turned into a powerful engine for medicine. Paul and his colleagues have created a program called ""Glass AI"" based off of ChatGPT. A doctor tells the Glass AI chatbot about a patient, and it can suggest a list of possible diagnoses and a treatment plan. Rather than working from the raw ChatGPT information base, the Glass AI system uses a virtual medical textbook written by humans as its main source of facts – something Paul says makes the system safer and more reliable.""We're working on doctors being able to put in a one-liner, a patient summary, and for us to be able to generate the first draft of a clinical plan for that doctor,"" he says. ""So what tests they would order and what treatments they would order.""Paul believes Glass AI helps with a huge need for efficiency in medicine. Doctors are stretched everywhere, and he says paperwork is slowing them down.""The physician quality of life is really, really rough. The documentation burden is massive,"" he says. ""Patients don't feel like their doctors have enough time to spend with them.""Bots at the bedsideIn truth, AI has already arrived in medicine, according to Keane. Keane also works as an ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and says that his field was among the first to see AI algorithms put to work. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an AI system that could read a scan of a patient's eyes to screen for diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to blindness.That technology is based on an AI precursor to the current chatbot systems. If it identifies a possible case of retinopathy, it then refers the patient to a specialist. Keane says the technology could potentially streamline work at his hospital, where patients are lining up out the door to see experts.""If we can have an AI system that is in that pathway somewhere that flags the people with the sight-threatening disease and gets them in front of a retina specialist, then that's likely to lead to much better outcomes for our patients,"" he says.Other similar AI programs have been approved for specialties like radiology and cardiology. But these new chatbots can potentially be used by all kinds of doctors treating a wide variety of patients.Alexandre Lebrun is CEO of a French startup called Nabla. He says the goal of his company's program is to cut down on the hours doctors spend writing up their notes.""We are trying to completely automate all this wasted time with AI,"" he says.Lebrun is open about the fact that chatbots have some problems. They can make up sources, get things wrong and behave erratically. In fact, his team's early experiments with ChatGPT produced some weird results.For example, when a fake patient told the chatbot it was depressed, the AI suggested ""recycling electronics"" as a way to cheer up.Despite this dismal consultation, Lebrun thinks there are narrow, limited tasks where a chatbot can make a real difference. Nabla, which he co-founded, is now testing a system that can, in real time, listen to a conversation between a doctor and a patient and provide a summary of what the two said to one another. Doctors inform their patients that the system is being used in advance, and as a privacy measure, it doesn't actually record the conversation.""It shows a report, and then the doctor will validate with one click, and 99% of the time it's right and it works,"" he says.The summary can be uploaded to a hospital records system, saving the doctor valuable time.Other companies are pursuing a similar approach. In late March, Nuance Communications, a subsidiary of Microsoft, announced that it would be rolling out its own AI service designed to streamline note-taking using the latest version of ChatGPT, GPT-4. The company says it will showcase its software later this month.AI reflects human biasesBut even if AI can get it right, that doesn't mean it will work for every patient, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, a computer scientist studying AI in healthcare at MIT. Her research shows that AI can be biased.""When you take state-of-the-art machine learning methods and systems and then evaluate them on different patient groups, they do not perform equally,"" she says.That's because these systems are trained on vast amounts of data made by humans. And whether that data is from the Internet, or a medical study, it contains all the human biases that already exist in our society.The problem, she says, is often these programs will reflect those biases back to the doctor using them. For example, her team asked an AI chatbot trained on scientific papers and medical notes to complete a sentence from a patient's medical record.""When we said 'White or Caucasian patient was belligerent or violent,' the model filled in the blank [with] 'Patient was sent to hospital,'"" she says. ""If we said 'Black, African American, or African patient was belligerent or violent,' the model completed the note [with] 'Patient was sent to prison.'""Ghassemi says many other studies have turned up similar results. She worries that medical chatbots will parrot biases and bad decisions back to doctors, and they'll just go along with it.""It has the sheen of objectivity: 'ChatGPT says you shouldn't have this medication. It's not me – a model, an algorithm made this choice,'"" she says.And it's not just a question of how individual doctors use these new tools, adds Sonoo Thadaney Israni, a researcher at Stanford University who co-chaired a recent National Academy of Medicine study on AI.""I don't know whether the tools that are being developed are being developed to reduce the burden on the doctor, or to really increase the throughput in the system,"" she says. The intent will have a huge effect on how the new technology affects patients.Regulators are racing to keep up with a flood of applications for new AI programs. The FDA, which oversees such systems as ""medical devices,"" said in a statement to NPR that it was working to ensure that any new AI software meets its standards.""The agency is working closely with stakeholders and following the science to make sure that Americans will benefit from new technologies as they further develop, while ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices,"" spokesperson Jim McKinney said in an email.But it is not entirely clear where chatbots specifically fall in the FDA's rubric, since, strictly speaking, their job is to synthesize information from elsewhere. Lebrun of Nabla says his company will seek FDA certification for their software, though he says in its simplest form, the Nabla note-taking system doesn't require it. Dereck Paul says Glass Health is not currently planning on seeking FDA certification for Glass AI.Doctors give chatbots a chanceBoth Lebrun and Paul say they are well aware of the problems of bias. And both know that chatbots can sometimes fabricate answers out of thin air. Paul says doctors who use his company's AI system need to check it.""You have to supervise it, the way we supervise medical students and residents, which means that you can't be lazy about it,"" he says.Both companies also say they are working to reduce the risk of errors and bias. Glass Health's human-curated textbook is written by a team of 30 clinicians and clinicians in training. The AI relies on it to write diagnoses and treatment plans, which Paul claims should make it safe and reliable.At Nabla, Lebrun says he's training the software to simply condense and summarize the conversation, without providing any additional interpretation. He believes that strict rule will help reduce the chance of errors. The team is also working with a diverse set of doctors located around the world to weed out bias from their software.Regardless of the possible risks, doctors seem interested. Paul says in December, his company had around 500 users. But after they introduced their chatbot, those numbers jumped.""We finished January with 2,000 monthly active users, and in February we had 4,800,"" Paul says. Thousands more signed up in March, as overworked doctors line up to give AI a try. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 05:13:00 EST",e71d685c3417651dfbb46b6f9d1772ad
6157,‘It’s an honor’: Modern Lovers frontman Jonathan Richman on lawmakers’ push to make ‘Roadrunner’ the state rock song,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/07/its-an-honor-modern-lovers-frontman-jonathan-richman-on-lawmakers-push-to-make-roadrunner-the-state-rock-song,"A decade after then-state Rep. Marty Walsh proposed the idea, legislators are bringing the proposal back.","Jonathan Richman, the rock legend behind “Roadrunner,” is thankful some lawmakers want his song to be the official rock song of Massachusetts.“It takes a lot of devotion to, you know, to take a song that you like and try and go somewhere with it,” Richman told GBH News. “I think it’s an honor that there are people in Massachusetts who would like to honor our old song in some way.” The 1972 track by The Modern Lovers, the band Richman fronted, features specific callouts to the Bay State — most directly, “I’m in love with Massachusetts.”Former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh first proposed the song be given the honor in 2013 when he was a state representative, a proposal that’s come up many times over the years. Now, state Rep. David Linsky of Natick and Sen. Bruce Tarr of Gloucester have co-filed bills to renew the effort. Richman, who grew up in Natick, said he wrote the song when he first moved to New York and felt nostalgic for his life in Massachusetts and “those lonely highways.” He thought other people wouldn’t even like the tune, which has since been twice included on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.“I just made it up for myself, really, just to make up this hypnotic chord guitar chord thing about how I felt about the loneliness of borrowing my father's car, which I did at 16 and 17, and driving around — and sort of being consoled by the lonely industrial parks, which felt as lonely as I felt,” Richman said. When the band recorded the song, he said it ended up sounding a lot happier than he originally had written it. “You might not realize how lonely that song is,” he said.“Well, actually I was saying I'm in love with my own loneliness. Isn't that kind of narcissistic? It's true, you know and I meant it that way. It was a sort of a lonely, self-involved song.”He said he was inspired to write the song after often seeing The Velvet Underground at the Boston Tea Party, a concert venue that was located in Boston’s South End. “I would see them and I would watch them improvise and do long improvisational chants like the song ‘Sister Ray,’” Richman said. ""And that's what that piece ‘Roadrunner’ was based on.”Richman said he still enjoys writing songs about Boston and his time in the rock scene. “I'm trying to express sort of how I feel sort of in a dreamy kind of way,” he said. “Like, I sing about the Fenway — because the Fenway is sort of a part of my inner world, just that little stretch of land. I don't mean the baseball park in this case. I mean the actual Fens, that strip.”Linsky, who brought the bill to the House, says Richman is an icon of the early punk scene in Boston.“Roadrunner is a fantastic song that captures the essence of why growing up in suburban Boston in the 1960s and 1970s was like,” Linsky said. “It talks about cruising past the Stop & Shop and driving on Route 9 and Route 128.”Linsky says the legislative process slowed down the measure happening in the past, but he’s hopeful he can get the bill to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk. For Richman’s part, he said he already has plans to come back and tour in Boston in the fall. “There are nights when a certain atmosphere happens in the crowd, and I see certain people who just have a certain feeling for Boston songs,” Richman said. “And I'll just put four or five of them together. Like I'll just string a whole bunch of them because I get in that mood to sing about Boston. “There's a certain thing that can happen in Boston that doesn't happen anywhere else,” he said.",Local,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 17:23:27 EST",cc8c3055f8a04afcd42554d0eb714a63

But if you continue to be yourself, and practice, and find good friends, you'll do it.","It's really hard to make it in the music business. But if you continue to be yourself, and practice, and find good friends, you'll do it.That's what a certain dog musician named Billy The Kid would tell you. You can read about his ruff beginnings in the new children's book, Billy The Kid Makes It Big.His story is written by someone who knows a thing or two about sticking to a music career: the one and only Dolly Parton.The music star and writer talks with NPR's Melissa Block about writing for children, standing up to bullies, and why her program to deliver books to children meant so much to her dad.This has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Interview highlightsOn Billy and why he inspired her to write the bookBilly belongs to my manager, Danny Nozell. And when Danny first brought him to the studio, I just fell in love with him. He's a tiny little thing. And I just claimed him. And I said I have to be his extra mama, or he has to be my goddog. [The book] is about confidence, about standing up to bullies. So it's really got a lot of meaningful things, I think, for children from four to seven. It's a story about him coming to Nashville, trying to make it in the business and being discouraged by some others and feeling sad. And finally meeting some friends that gave him confidence.On being bullied as a childI have a song and a book called, Coat of Many Colors. My mama had made me a little coat out of rags, because she didn't have enough of the same material to make me a coat and it was getting winter time. So, while she made that coat she told me the story about Joseph in the Bible. And boy, I thought I just really looked like Joseph, and I was so proud of it, and wore it to school. And the kids laughed and said it was just rags, and I didn't look like Joseph, and that we were poor and all that. I remember crying so hard. And kids always remember things like that, your first deep hurt.So that followed me and years later, I didn't really know it was so in there, I wrote a song about it. So since then, I've written lots of songs that I know are things that children deal with, whether it be the bullying, or just being hurt, or having no confidence, and being able to stay strong and believe in who you are. On staying true to yourselfI believe that we all should have the chance to be exactly who we are. And I even wrote a song [Be That] about how whatever you are, be that. Whatever you do, do that. Anything else is just an act. You can't be something different than you are. And when you try, it's just a fake, and you're never complete as a human being.On her dad not learning to read or writeMy dad didn't get a chance to read or write. And that bothered him. And that bothered me that it bothered him. So, I got this idea to start the [Imagination Library] program where we give books to children from the time they were born, once a month, till they started school. We were just thinking about our home county, and it grew so fast. And then it went all over Tennessee. And then went into Canada. And now we're all over the world. My dad took great pride in that. He got to live long enough to see it doing really well. He just told me he was very proud of me. And that he felt like I was doing something special. I was proud that he got to be part of something great. And he could feel better about himself.On still writing songs, and where she gets her inspirationI'm always drawing things from my childhood. I incorporate a lot of things from my life and even up-to-date things. I've always said my life is in my songs. Even if they're not all true experiences, some of the feelings and some of the lines are always mine.I can be in the kitchen cooking, and all of a sudden, I'll getting an idea for a song. Sometimes I get woke up in the middle of the night, just wake up and think, ""Why am I awake?"" And I think, ""Well, I guess because I need to say something."" So, I get up and I'll go find a pen and some paper. I usually try to keep a notepad by my bed, because I often dream about singing songs. I've written with my lipstick and eyebrow pencil a lot!

A federal judge in Boston sentenced Charles Lieber on Wednesday to six months home confinement and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine. In a court appearance, Lieber, who had been one of the world's top chemists until his arrest, expressed remorse.“I regret the things that brought me here,” he said, wiping away tears. “I lost my job, my career and my freedom.”Prosecutors had asked for a three-month prison term for the 64-year-old academic, who was recently diagnosed with lymphoma. The government also argued that Lieber should pay a fine of more than $180,000, stating in court documents that he had “embarked on a years-long scheme to further his career through lies and deceit, while also lining his pockets courtesy of the Chinese government.” Federal officials arrested Lieber on Harvard’s campus as part of the China Initiative, an effort launched by the Justice Department under the Trump administration to counter academic espionage and theft of American intellectual property. A jury found Lieber guilty of lying to Harvard and the IRS about payments he received for participating in a recruitment program organized by the Chinese government. Lieber quietly resigned from his position at Harvard, where he had been on paid administrative leave. In pushing for a lighter sentence and home detention, Lieber’s attorneys argued that he didn’t knowingly lie to the government. They also said Lieber's late stage cancer diagnosis and weakened immune system would mean that any time he spent in prison would be “a death sentence.""",Education,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 16:23:20 EST",14cc97275a456f2491b35a88f3e285fc
4695,Sara Ting's 'Sun Poem' continues to radiate light across Boston and the world,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/26/sara-tings-sun-poem-continues-to-radiate-light-across-boston-and-the-world,"Ting wrote the poem in a personal journal in 1978, but wasn't published until 1985.","“Are you greater than the sun that shines on everyone? Black, brown, yellow, red and white — the sun does not discriminate.” Boston activist Sara Ting penned “The Sun Poem” in 1985 in a campaign to recognize and promote racial and ethnic harmony through words. Sara, who is Chinese American, has empowered people all across the country through those words. She even got “The Sun Poem” recognized in a resolution unanimously passed by the Boston City Council. It also inspired the founding of World Unity Inc., a nonprofit that since 1994 has promoted diversity and aimed to change Boston’s reputation of being unwelcoming to people of color. In 2020, then-Mayor Marty Walsh went so far as to declare racism a public health crisis.On this week’s edition of the Joy Beat, Ting sat down with All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss “The Sun Poem” and the work of World Unity Inc.Arun Rath: You’ve said that “The Sun Poem” was born in Boston, so take us back to 1985 and the gestation of the poem.Sara Ting: It was actually written in 1978 in a personal journal; it didn’t become public until 1985. The poem came on a journey I was on at that time to try and understand the meaning of God. In life, we have different camps of people: those who believe in God, those who don’t, and those who aren’t sure. I was one of the groups that didn’t feel sure, and I said, “Let me find out if God really exists.” I thought the best way to do this was to find a place of worship. I thought this was going to be an easy journey. It wasn’t. At the first place I went to, at the end of the service, I thought someone would welcome me and say good morning — some word of acknowledgment that I was standing in front of you. Not one single person spoke to me. Not one person said, “Good morning, welcome.” It was like I was invisible.Now, I didn’t let that affect me too much. I thought, “Well, this is not the only church in Boston. I’ll try another one."" The same thing happened again. I said, “Well, I’ll go across the river.” Unfortunately, the same thing happened; no one spoke to me. And then I thought to myself, “I’m a friendly person. I don’t need somebody to come up to me and say 'Good morning' and 'Hello.' I’ll do the outreach. So I went back to Boston, and there were about 200 people in this particular place. At the end of the service, I kind of looked around to see if there might be a friendly face. I picked out this couple and introduced myself, and I thought, “Great, I can have an engaging conversation.” It wasn’t. At this point, I’m feeling really, really dejected. As the bus came, I stepped onto the bus, and I didn’t see any passengers. As the bus was pulling away, the sun broke through, the clouds came shining on my face — the rays of the sun — and I heard this voice in me: “I don’t just shine for you, Sara. I shine on everyone.” And the poem was born. “Are you greater than the sun that shines on everyone? Black, brown, yellow, red and white. The sun does not discriminate.”Rath: That’s wonderful. Tell us about the journey from there to World Unity Inc.Ting: So what inspired the founding of World Unity Inc. was this poem. It was part of a public service campaign in 1985, and I was commissioned to produce a 4-by-8-foot poster for the YWCA because their first imperative is the elimination of racism. I’m at an event, and a young lady comes up to me and wants to tell me what the poem did to her. I said, “OK.” Apparently, she was a member of the YWCA, and when she first saw this poem, she couldn’t ignore it. She said she actually hated the poem. I knew she wasn’t being malicious; she wanted to tell me what this poem did for her. Apparently, when she saw the poem, it opened up the wounds and brought back the memories of being discriminated in Boston as an Asian American woman. She realized over time, after seeing this poem over and over again, that she had to let go of the past and forgive.The minute I heard the word “forgiveness,” this vision to build a permanent landmark showcased in this poem came to me, and the need to create an organization whose mission will be not only to promote equality, diversity and inclusion, but to build this landmark. Rath: You know, we’re in Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month right now. I was just on a panel this week talking about some of our shared heritage, so it feels like this conversation is especially timely. Also, we’re in a context of a new kind of anti-Asian hate. Talk about this context at this moment because I feel like we really need “The Sun Poem” right now. Ting: Let me say this: There are no laws, policies or technology that’s going to remove anyone’s biases or hate. The change we need has to come from within the person. The poem can help ignite the change; it’s up to the individual to want to be a better human being and to want to grow personally and professionally. The beauty of the poem is that there’s no judgment in it; it just invites each of us to answer this simple question: Are you greater than the sun that shines on everyone? So we have to think again, well, how am I treating anyone who is different from me? What it requires of each of us is to be honest with ourselves and to have the courage to face yourself and be OK with being accountable. On the other side of this concrete is growth and the opportunity to have a wider circle of friends and to have a life that’s much richer than you’d ever imagine. The poem actually also inspired a song and a wonderful program called Singing Equality Across America and Around the World. The song was performed at the United Nations by children in 2015. One child said that when he sings it, it makes him feel like he can do anything. We want all children to feel that way. They look at the world with fresh eyes and a pure heart. The words that they shared with us about the impact of the song and the poem, to me, speak the truth.",Local,"Fri, 26 May 2023 17:15:36 EST",28cae5065b0f8b9e6d23f64b45d52283
473,Boston officials want your input on how the city should spend its opioid settlement funds,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/19/boston-officials-want-your-input-on-how-the-city-should-spend-its-opioid-settlement,The city is due to receive about $22 million in funding to help fight the opioid crisis.,"New data released by the Boston Public Health Commission draws into sharp relief the growing severity of the city's opioid crisis. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the commission's executive director, told GBH News' All Things Considered that the pandemic had a major impact on patients struggling with opioid addiction. ""During the height of the pandemic, so many people were disengaged from services, from harm reduction, as well as treatment,"" she said. ""We're really still in the phase where we're regrouping and bringing people back into care and trying to address this as aggressively as we can.""Now, Ojikutu said there is an opportunity to do more. Following Massachusett's $230 million settlement with opioid manufacturers, the city of Boston is due to receive about $22 million in funding to help fight the opioid crisis. Okijutu says that community input will be a major factor in how that money is used. ""It is critically important for us to use the funding in such a way that is informed by those communities and by those families who have been most impacted,"" she said. In order to gather this community feedback, the Boston Public Health Comission has released an online survey where anyone can share their thoughts about what to do with the incoming funding. The survey is availible in nine languages and will be open until Aug. 9. The Boston Public Health Commission's report shows that in 2022, opioid-related deaths rose by nearly 7% over the year before. Over the past four years, opioid-related deaths increased by over 36%. Ojikutu said multiple factors have contributed to the rise in deaths, including tainted drugs and that drop in services, as well as systemic barriers. The report noted stark racial disparities in who is dying of opioid overdoses. Black residents accounted for 30% of all opioid overdose deaths in Boston between 2020 and 2022, and Latino residents accounted for 21%. Black and Latino residents also had a 66% mortality rate from opioid overdoses, compared to 31% for white residents.""I think it's important for us to consider that there may be significant and reasonable and rational hesitation for a person of color, particularly a Black or Latinx individual, to reach out, to get help to access harm reduction,"" Ojikutu said. ""We have a long history of discrimination and racism within the criminal justice system, and that may certainly deter people of color from seeking harm reduction or treatment.""On top of that, Ojikutu points out the structural barriers that some patients of color face when accessing healthcare, such as the limited access to addiction specialists within lower-income neighborhoods. Breaking down these barriers has become a focus for the Boston Public Health Comission.""One of the things that we've been doing since I've taken on this role is that we are evaluating our own programing to determine whether or not there is inequity in access to the services that we provide, because we really have to start with our own problems and fix our own house,"" she said.",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 14:10:46 EST",7116f0779bb6c35375aea5388d62eef5
5392,'The sky isn't classified': Harvard astronomer on studying the extraterrestrial,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/04/26/the-sky-isnt-classified-harvard-astronomer-on-studying-the-extraterrestrial,Professor Avi Loeb recently co-authored a paper with Pentagon official Sean Kirkpatrick.,"As a highly respected astronomer, Harvard professor and former chair of Harvard’s astronomy department Avi Loeb made waves when he started talking and writing about extraterrestrial intelligence. He last came on GBH’s All Things Considered to discuss his idea that the strange, extrasolar object known as Oumuamua might have been an interstellar alien spacecraft. Since then, he’s become even more serious about searching for evidence of alien intelligence with his own organization and with the Pentagon. Loeb returned to All Things Considered and joined host Arun Rath to explain his research in detail.Arun Rath: First off, give us a little bit of context on where we are with this situation. It was last summer when the Department of Defense created a new office to track unidentified aerial phenomenons — what we used to call unidentified flying objects or UFOs. But could you briefly explain what’s going on here, and why the Pentagon decided to get serious about this?Avi Loeb: About half a year ago, the director of the new office in government that deals with anomalies wrote me an email and said that he is visiting the Boston area in the coming weeks and asked me whether I’m available to meet with him. I said yes, of course, and he came to my home. As a result of that, we wrote a scientific paper together in which we talked about the physical constraints that can be put on unidentified objects based on the limited data we have.In this paper, we speculated about possible scenarios by which probes may be released toward the Earth; for example, from a mothership, because the second interstellar meteor had the same distance of closest approach to the sun. So more and more, I thought to myself, “Well, maybe it was released by a smaller probe released by a mothership.” But then it turned out to have originated from a different direction, and so they were not actually related.But in the paper with Sean Kirkpatrick, we mentioned the possibility that the mothership would come by or pass near Earth — just like Oumuamua did — and release a lot of probes that can visit different planets in the habitable zone. Rath: Based on what we’ve seen of some of these objects, I imagine there’s an argument to be made that this technology would be beyond any of our adversaries.Loeb: Not necessarily. I think the government is confused. It’s unclear what the nature of these unidentified objects might be. From a scientific point of view, the fundamental question is whether there is even one object that is of extraterrestrial technological origin. That’s what the Galileo Project that I established a year and a half ago is trying to find out. We have an operating observatory at Harvard University that we assembled over the past year. It has infrared optical cameras and a radio and audio sensor that are monitoring the sky 24/7. The data is being fed to an artificial intelligence classification software that tries to figure out whether any of the objects we look at are natural in origin, like birds, or human-made objects, like drones, balloons or airplanes.My approach to this puzzle is that rather than deal with past events that were anecdotally reported with compromised instruments that we can never revisit because the data was collected from months or years ago, it’s much better to have instruments that are fully under our control. After all, the sky is not classified; it’s only the sensors that the government used that are classified that make the data classified. The best data is not available to us, to scientists, or to the public simply because it was collected by sensors that are classified that the government doesn’t want adversaries to be aware of.Rath: How much has your project, the Galileo Project, been involved with the Pentagon office? Have you been sharing a lot of data?Loeb: Well, the past couple of years were very interesting. After my book “Extraterrestrial” came out, a lot of high-level people came to my home. They included multibillionaires that funded the Galileo Project. They were inspired by the vision and the fact that there was no scientific search for technological devices near Earth from an extraterrestrial civilization, and also the fact that the first three out of four interstellar objects that were discovered over the past decade appear to be weird, unusual outliers relative to the rocks that we found from the solar system before the asteroids or the comets just over the past decade. We could find those objects that entered the solar system from outside with no survey telescopes, with no satellites the government employs.The first two were meteors roughly the size of a meter that collided with the Earth and burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere. We realized that both of them arrived from outside the solar system. They were moving very fast. So we discovered the first two interstellar meteors.Then, about seven months after the second one, there was the object, Oumuamua, which was discovered by a telescope in Hawaii. That object was much bigger, the size of a football field — about 200 times bigger than those meteors. It also looked weird because it had an extreme shape, most likely flat, and it was pushed away from the sun by some mysterious force without showing any cometary evaporation. There was no comet around it. I suggested it [the force] was the reflection of sunlight, and for that, the object had to be very thin, unlike the asteroids or comets we had seen before. And actually, three years later, the same telescope in Hawaii discovered another object with no cometary tail, and it ended up being a rocket booster that NASA launched in 1966. It had thin walls and was made of stainless steel, so clearly, it was artificial in origin; that’s why it didn’t evaporate, and we know it because we produced it. The question is: who produced Oumuamua, or the meteors? And I should say the meteors are also unusual in the sense that they are made of material that has a strength that is at least ten times bigger than all other space rocks in NASA’s catalog of meteors over the past decade. But it’s also possible that there are spacecrafts made of some artificial alloy, like stainless steel. We’re going to find out. We’ve planned an expedition to the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2023, and we will look for the fragments of the first interstellar meteor and try to figure out what it was made of. Rath: So if you recover this object deep in the Pacific, will that be the first interstellar object that we’ve recovered?Loeb: Yeah. It would be the first time that humans put their hands on the material that makes an object the size of a person from outside the solar system. So no matter what, it will be exciting. Since we expect its material strength to be quite unusual, we will learn something new, irrespective of whether it’s natural or artificial in origin. That’s why I find it exciting, and I’m willing to sleep on the deck next to the machine room for a couple of weeks this summer.",Science and Technology,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 17:37:34 EST",a314d095768768c471359ca199a2bc42

""So that was pretty cool.""Her friend Carolyn Cree agreed. ""Especially in this time, like, everyone feels supported by him, you know?""The women were referring to the pope's recent remarks to journalists, on his flight home following a visit to Sudan, in which he denounced laws criminalizing LGBT people. He said such legislation is an injustice and a sin, because LGBT people ""are children of God and God loves them.""Back in St Peter's Square, his message over, Francis delivered his signature sign-off:""Don't forget to pray for me,"" the pope said. ""Have a great meal and arrivederci.""As the crowd cheered, the 86-year-old pope returned to the modest Vatican City guest house where he has chosen to live, renouncing the pomp and isolation of the Apostolic Palace.After a decade as pope, Francis continues to push for reformIn that same square on March 13, 2013, the new pope introduced himself as coming from the ""end of the world."" Born in Argentina, Jorge Bergoglio became the first non-European pontiff in more than a millenium.Since that day, says Massimo Faggioli, professor of theology at Villanova University, Francis has made clear the old world no longer calls the shots on what's Catholic and what's not.""The Western hemisphere, the North Atlantic, a certain bourgeois Catholicism, he has rejected that in the most radical terms,"" says Faggioli.The first Jesuit pope and the first to take the name Francis - after the saint of the poor - was elected with a mandate to clean up a scandal-ridden Vatican administration. Papal biographer and veteran Vatican watcher Marco Politi says Francis' reforms of the Vatican bank, for example, are radical.""It is no more possible that mafia money flows through the Vatican bank or corruption money for political parties in Italy like it was in the past,"" Politi says.And he says it's not only on financial issues that Francis has left his mark.""He has wiped off from the table all the obsession of the Catholic Church about sexual issues,"" Politi says, adding that Francis shuns the culture wars and rarely speaks about birth control or abortion.""He doesn't change the letter of some church documents,"" Politi says. ""But with his gestures or with his words, he paves the way to new attitudes.""The pope has taken on populists throughout the worldFrancis has travelled widely across the globe, mostly to the peripheries where Catholics are few and feel marginalized.His first trip was to the island of Lampedusa, closer to Tunisia than to Italy — the gateway to Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants making the perilous sea crossing on smugglers' rickety boats.There, he harshly attacked what he called the ""globalization of indifference"" –- one of his many appeals not welcomed by nationalist and populist politicians.And Francis has promoted outreach to other religions, in particular intensifying the Church's dialogue with Islam.And yet, Francis has proved perhaps more than his cardinal electors had bargained for.He has angered many conservatives inside and outside the Catholic Church for his scathing critiques of laissez-fair capitalism and his staunch environmentalism.In Bolivia in 2015, Francis gave one of his most scathing speeches. Behind the harm being done to the environment is what he called the ""dung of the devil, the unfettered pursuit of money.""""Once capital becomes an idol and guides people's decisions,"" the pope said, ""once greed for money presides over the entire socio-economic system, it ruins society, it sets people against one another, it even puts at risk our common home, our sister mother Earth.""And during a visit to Mexico, Francis famously prayed at the U.S. border.On the flight back to Rome, he was asked about then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's promise to build a wall along the border. The pope replied, ""A person who only builds walls and not bridges is not Christian.""Francis has pushed the boundaries of Catholic practice, and conservatives have pushed backWithin the Church, Francis has opened the door slightly to divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion. And he's making the Church less Vatican-centric, says Politi, delegating more decisions to bishops. ""It is a slow process of decentralization,"" he says.The pope has opened up the Church administration, with many women in leadership positions.And he has declared war on clericalism — that old boys' network of priests, bishops and cardinals — the privileged caste that rules over an unquestioning flock.""This kind of elitism is something that drives pope Francis crazy,"" says David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University.Francis, Gibson adds, considers clericalism the major sin of the Church –- the cause of the abuse of power and the sexual abuse of minors that has convulsed Catholicism throughout the world.Francis tackled the cover-ups of clerical abusers as much as their crimes, says Gibson, by finally holding those responsible accountable.But, adds Gibson, resistance to this papacy is intense.""The opposition to Francis is increasingly vocal, the opposition is very strong. It's very passionate. It's everything goes,"" he says.Francis' traditionalist adversaries accuse him of sowing confusion among the faithful by focusing on pastoral issues rather than doctrine.An anonymous memo published last year –- apparently written by the late Australian Cardinal George Pell –- called this papacy ""a catastrophe.""German Cardinal Gerhard Müller — removed by Francis as Vatican theological watchdog –- went public with his criticism last October. In an interview with the conservative Catholic cable tv network EWTN, he poured scorn on what he sees as Francis' progressive agenda.""This occupation of the Catholic Church is a hostile takeover of the Church of Jesus Christ,"" Mueller said. ""And they think that doctrine is only like a program of a political party, (which) can change...according to their voters.""But in contrast with his conservative predecessors, Francis has never disciplined his critics. Instead, he has more or less ignored them. When pressed by journalists on the recent flight back from Africa, Francis was succinct.""Those people are without ethics,"" he said. ""They are of a political party, not of the Church.""Some Vatican observers say a civil war is under way in the Catholic Church, as Francis' adversaries step up efforts to push the pope to resign.But, says Gibson, time is on Francis' side – the longer he stays, the more cardinals he'll appoint who will choose his successor.""So, time equals power and influence in the Catholic Church,"" says Gibson, ""and the conservatives feel they're running out of time.""Some see a misstep in Francis' response to the war in UkraineThere's one issue where Francis has been sharply criticized by both liberals and conservatives – his initial reluctance to name Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine.The Vatican has stressed the Holy See's traditional role as mediator in international disputes. And in recent months Francis has increasingly singled out Moscow as having started the war.But theologian Massimo Faggioli says that initial reluctance was a serious misstep, showing the Argentine pope had not fully grasped the historical implications of war breaking out yet again in Europe.""And when a political leader, as is the pope, when he speaks about wars, when he speaks on issues that are so serious,"" says Faggioli, ""every word should be measured very carefully."" The pope's most ambitious project is the ongoing vast global consultation on the Church's future, culminating with two bishops' assemblies at the Vatican this year and next. Francis' goal is a more inclusive church, where everyone can be heard and share in the decision-making.The conservatives will likely do all they can to thwart the pope's agenda.

Maura Healey a chance to appoint someone to the state's highest court early in her first term.The SJC announced Monday that Cypher, who turned 64 in February, will retire from the court on Jan. 12, 2024 after a nearly seven-year tenure. A court spokesperson said Cypher ""wants to devote her time to teaching and research.""Cypher will take a position at Boston College Law School for the spring 2024 semester as a Huber Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law. She said in a statement that she is ""looking forward to pursuing my love of teaching.""Her departure will come several years before Cypher turns 70, the mandatory retirement age for Massachusetts judges, and creates the first vacancy on the SJC since Healey was elected in November.Healey's predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Baker, saw the entire court turn over during his two terms and appointed all seven current members.""On behalf of the people of Massachusetts, I'd like to offer our deep gratitude to Justice Cypher for her decades of service to our state and wish her the very best in her well-earned retirement,"" Healey said. ""Our administration is committed to appointing a distinguished Supreme Court Justice who will uphold justice, equality and the rule of the law.""A 1986 Suffolk University Law School graduate, Cypher began her legal career as an associate at the Boston law firm of Grayer, Brown and Dilday and then spent nearly two decades in the Bristol County district attorney's office as an assistant DA and then chief of the appellate division.She joined the judiciary in 2000, after Gov. Paul Cellucci appointed her as an appeals court justice and she won approval from the Governor's Council. Baker picked her in 2017 for a spot on the high court, and again the elected council confirmed her to a new role.""Justice Cypher has brought her keen knowledge of the law and the constitution to the appellate courts for over two decades, serving on the Supreme Judicial Court for the past six years,"" said SJC Chief Justice Kimberly Budd. ""She has been an exceptional friend and colleague and an active role model to the many people who count her as a mentor. We are deeply grateful for her service to the people of the Commonwealth.""Healey has not nominated any judges six months into her four-year term, and several openings loom on the Superior Court.Last week, Healey sent her first nomination to the Governor's Council, proposing another five-year term on the Parole Board for Dr. Charlene Bonner.A Healey spokesperson said the governor will form a nominating commission to navigate the process of picking Cypher's replacement and added that the administration ""will have more details in the coming weeks.""Born in 1959, Cypher is still more than half a decade away from bumping up against mandatory retirement age -- in fact, none of the current SJC justices are expected to hit that threshold during the current gubernatorial term.While many serve until they turn 70, some judges have opted to leave before reaching obligatory retirement, such as Justice Robert Cordy, who in 2016 departed the SJC to return to his former law firm.[Sam Doran contributed reporting.]",Politics,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:39:53 EST",6f096dee48c695549fa0c64da904b346

LIV Golf, which is funded by the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund, debuted in 2022 with its invitational series at The Centurion Club in London. LIV positioned itself as an alternative to the PGA Tour and offered multimillion-dollar contracts and big prize money to attract athletes. Some defected and joined the new organization, while many refused because of the Saudi regime's track record of human rights abuses. As the two organizations fought over athletes, the PGA Tour branded itself as the moral option. The PGA now says this merger will “unify the game of golf on a global basis.” The decision is leaving players and fans feeling betrayed. ""I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite,"" Jay Monahan, commissioner of the PGA, said after the merger announcement. Shira Springer, a sports journalist and lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management, told Greater Boston the PGA Tour felt LIV Golf was enough of a threat that they needed to join forces. Just months before the merger, PGA Tour officials had pushed to disqualify LIV Golf due to Saudi Arabia’s record of human rights violations. “Really, it all comes down to money,” said Springer. “The Saudi Public Investment Fund agreed to invest an awful lot of money in the PGA. The head of that fund now becomes the chairman of this merged tour, and Monahan ... becomes the CEO. And that's the arrangement.”By controlling men's professional golf, Springer said Saudi Arabia is trying to change their global image.""This is not their only attempt at sportswashing. They basically bought Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the most well-known soccer players in the world. He now plays in Saudi Arabia. And another high-profile soccer player, Karim Benzema, is leaving to play in Saudi Arabia for big bucks,"" said Springer. ""The Saudis clearly see sports as a way to put a friendlier face on their authoritarian regime and to basically cover up their human rights violations.”Families of the 9/11 victims have been fighting an ongoing federal lawsuit against the Saudi government for its alleged involvement in the attacks. The 9/11 Families United has condemned the merger, saying “PGA Tour leaders should be ashamed of their hypocrisy and greed.”Springer said sportswashing isn't going to go away anytime soon.“There has to be some systemic change or change in governance of these major international sporting organizations for there to be real change,” she said.",National,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:28:57 EST",a6409102d249201b2973b36d16cea0f6

Boston’s own Guster joined Boston Public Radio Tuesday ahead of their sold-out shows at Boston Symphony Hall with conductor Keith Lockhart, who they’ve performed with a number of times over the last two decades. “He [Keith] was the young conductor at the time, coming into this — this was 18 years ago — and was realizing, ‘Hey, we need to bring youth into the Symphony. Let’s partner with a Boston band that can bring young people’ — meaning, like, 40-year-olds,” said Adam Gardner, the band’s guitarist. “This was our first-ever orchestra show, 18 years ago,” frontman Ryan Miller chimed in, estimating that the band had performed with the Pops about a dozen times. “And then Keith walked in yesterday. I don’t know if he said this, but in my mind, he was like, ‘Oh, time is a cruel mistress.’ He looked at us and his own life flashed before his eyes.”The band members also took the time to address their friendship and fans. “We’ve been having a blast for 30 years now — and if we weren’t, we probably wouldn’t be doing this,” drummer Brian Rosenworcel said. “We keep the relationships strong. If you’re communicating and your friendships are strong, you’re gonna want to make music together.”“A lot of it, too is just having people that continue to show up to support the band,” Miller added. “Part of it for us, I think, is the amazement that every time we can put up a Tanglewood or a Pops or do three days at a festival that there could be 3, 4, 5,000 people that show up, that still cares about our music. We feel like we have to take this very seriously, keep trying really hard, to challenge ourselves, and really honor our relationships — and just try and make good stuff so they’re not embarrassed to wear their Guster T-shirts.”Tickets go on sale June 12 for Guster’s performance at the BSO’s Tanglewood. Later this summer, the band will headline its third annual On the Ocean festival in Portland, Maine, August 11-13.",Local,"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 18:13:51 EST",b2e5c5a162ce5a246e07ac73c92ecd02

She wore a traditional embroidered blouse called a sorochka. Abakumova came to the U.S. with her eight-year-old daughter in June as part of a special refugee program for Ukrainian citizens. They're now living in Sudbury, where she says the pine trees remind her of the place she grew up. Still, much of her family remains back in Ukraine.""And I hope everything will be alright,” she said. “And I hope this terrible war [is] stopped.”Life before the Russian invasion used to be normal, Abakumova said.""I had a lot of concerts, a lot of performances. I was enjoying life with my family,” she said in Ukrainian, as interpreted by Iryna Piotrowska, a Ukrainian woman who lives in Belmont, and whose idea it was to put on Friday's fundraising concert. “But on the February 24th, everything changed.""They left their home because Russian bombs were targeting cities, and they moved to a village where her in-laws lived. But they couldn't escape the war there, either.""We were hearing the loud noises of missiles,” she said through the interpreter. “So my daughter and I, we were spending time, days, in the bathroom. I was actually making her bed in the bathroom, and she was sleeping there because it was the safest place in the house.""They applied for the U.S. refugee program, and Abakumova and her daughter came to America in June, leaving her husband behind. He plays the tuba in the Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Khmelnytsky Regional Philharmonic.“And now he has many concerts in Europe supporting Ukraine and [the] Ukrainian army, military,"" Abakumova said in English.When she recalls the anguish of bidding her husband farewell, she switches to the Ukrainian language.""I was crying. My husband was crying,” she said. “It was heartbreaking because we just don't know when we will see each other again.""One of the songs Abakumova will sing Friday is called ""Two Colors"" and is about a sorochka shirt like the one she was wearing. The song tells of a son leaving home, and his mother sewing him a red and black sorochka. ""Red symbolizes love and black symbolizes sadness,” she said. “It's very apt for the situation, for the current situation now, because it's all tied together: love, and black for sadness, for the difficult situation that we're in.""The idea to hold a fundraising concert came from Iryna Piotrowska, who grew up in Ukraine and now lives in Belmont, where she takes a Zumba dance fitness class in the large auditorium in the town hall where the concert will be held. Piotrowska’s family in Ukraine includes a brother-in-law fighting on the front lines. “And I would like to do something because I feel terrible inside,” Piotrowska said. “I feel so bad for my family, that they're living in this situation like this.”The concert will take place at Belmont Town Hall Friday at 6 p.m., and it will be live streamed on Belmont Media Center's YouTube page. It’s a fundraiser for the Belmont-based nonprofit Refugee Protection International, which will use the money to support two hospitals in southern Ukraine damaged in January. ""They urgently need more surgical equipment, neonatal equipment, OB equipment, so mothers can give birth safely,” said the organization’s president Jennifer Hill. “And that, we will bring in as soon as we get the money, we’ll buy more and bring in across the border.""As she looked ahead to Friday's concert, Abakumova switched back to English for a moment.""For me, it's so important, like to take part in a performance supporting Ukraine, because it's...""For a moment, she searched for the words in English before saying, in her mother tongue, that her performance Friday is a small contribution that she can make to help.SeparatorCorrection: This story was updated to correct the date when Olga said she left her home.",Local,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 18:30:18 EST",839611a53aa4c6c2f86e2f21cc7807b7

Maura Healey's decision to end the state’s public health emergency on May 11 — signaling the end of full-time masking in healthcare settings. The group is also asking that all Massachusetts health care institutions provide free N95 masks. The coalition has collected more than 700 signatures in an open letter urging the Department of Public Health, local boards of health, and Massachusetts health care institutions to maintain masking requirments.The organization also launched a petition urging the state to ensure free PCR COVID tests for all residents. Dr. Lara Jirmanus, a primary care physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School, said at a virtual event Wednesday that removing masks in health care puts people at risk in the very place that they are accessing vital health care services.“It also exposes people to COVID without their informed consent, especially babies and children who can't mask,” she said. “People can bring these infections home to their loved ones and hurt them. And I will say personally, as a parent of a 16-month-old baby, this is part of my calculation.”The Department of Public Health said they spoke with hospitals and infection control experts ahead of the decision to lift the masking order, and that no one they spoke with shared major concerns about lifting the mandate. In fact, some of those stakeholders requested the mandate be lifted earlier than planned.“This decision is aligned with CDC guidance and federal requirements based on transmission rates, and was made following extensive conversations with health care experts,” a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services said in a statement to GBH News. “The Department of Public Health will continue to carefully track COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts and adjust as circumstances change.” Jennifer Ritz-Sullivan is the COVID justice leader for Marked by COVID Massachusetts, a nonprofit that advocates for people who the pandemic has deeply impacted. Her mother was 66 years old and disabled, and died in the intensive care unit from COVID-19. She feels her mother’s death, and the deaths of others, could have been prevented by the wearing of masks. “Millions who have died from COVID have been treated as disposable,” Ritz-Sullivan said. “And I feel the need to remind you nobody is disposable. Tens of millions throughout the country and hundreds of thousands right here in Massachusetts are grieving these losses as our community continues to grow unnecessarily daily.”Ritz-Sullivan said she is constantly worried about the risk of getting COVID herself, since she is disabled, along with her husband, who is an essential worker. “I should not be forced to subject myself to further disability or death to meet my basic needs and receive the medical care that I need to survive,” she said. “The pandemic is not over. These losses were and continue to be the result of policy choices and will only worsen if our government continues to ignore this pandemic.”Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, author of “The Future is Disabled,” said the lack of COVID precautions in hospitals can prevent disabled people from feeling like they can safely get the care they need. “We are valuable and we deserve to be able to be in public, go and access health care without wondering if we're going to die or get sick or get even more disabled than we already are,” they said.",Local,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 16:28:31 EST",72cd8884cbdf9cf06082e2344732f9a6

He was promptly resuscitated on the field and rushed to the hospital. Hamlin remained in critical condition for days, and was hospitalized until January 11th. While he has thanked the public for their support since, he only announced the cause for his frightening health scare this week. His collapse garnered attention for multiple reasons; the NFL's speedy response has been credited with helping save Hamlin's life, and the incident was used by anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists as fodder against the COVID-19 shot. Want more health journalism? Listen to Consider This on how over-the-counter narcan could help save more livesWhat's the big deal? This week, Hamlin announced his clearance to return to the NFL in September, with a renewed sense of purpose: raising awareness for the cardiac condition that caused his collapse in the first place. Hamlin attributed his collapse to commotio cordis, a rare cause of cardiac arrest, ""that starts with a blow to the chest in a precise spot at just the wrong time in the heartbeat,"" according to the American Heart Association. After recovering and consulting with medical experts, he's been given a clear pass to return to the game. Now, he's focused on raising awareness, and shared his new goal: ""Commotio cordis is the leading cause of death in youth athletes across all sports. So that's something that I personally will be taking a step in to make a change. Also, with that being said, all of the awareness around CPR and access to AEDs have been lowering that number as well."" What are people saying now? On his feelings towards returning to the sport: My heart is still in it. My heart is still in the game, I love the game. It's something I want to prove to myself — not nobody else. I just want to show people that fear is a choice. You can keep going in something without having the answers and without knowing what's at the end of the tunnel. Or you might feel anxious, you might feel any type of way, but you keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.On surviving this ordeal: ""Not to sound cliché, but the wild moment is every day just being able to wake up and take deep breaths and live a peaceful life. To have a family, to have people around me that love me and care about me, and for those people to still have me in their lives. You know they almost lost me. I died on national TV in front of the whole world. So, I see it from all perspectives. For them to still have me around, and for me to still have them, it goes both ways. And I lost a bunch of people in my life, and I know a bunch of people who have lost people in their lives, and I know that feeling. So that right there is just the biggest blessing of it all. For me to still have my people, and for my people to still have me."" So, what now? According to the NFL, Hamlin's foundation, Chasing M, will be raising awareness to CPR training and efforts to provide defibrillators to youth sports. Despite this past experience with playing football Hamlin says this on his return: ""I've been beating statistics my whole life, so I like my chances here.""

3090,Activist Judy Heumann led a reimagining of what it means to be disabled,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/06/activist-judy-heumann-led-a-reimagining-of-what-it-means-to-be-disabled,Heumann was a major American civil rights hero who remained little known until a flurry of attention in the last three years of her life.,"Judy Heumann was the first person I called when, in 1987, I reported my first story on disability rights. Judy, who contracted polio when she was 18 months old, gave me the quote that perfectly summed up that little-known civil rights movement. ""Disability only becomes a tragedy when society fails to provide the things we need to lead our lives — job opportunities or barrier-free buildings, for example,"" she said. ""It is not a tragedy to me that I'm living in a wheelchair."" That idea seemed so unexpected and strange that my editors at a newsmagazine decided not to publish my story. It was still a radical claim that disabled people didn't see themselves, or their conditions, as something to be pitied. Or that they insisted what most held them back wasn't their health condition but society's exclusion — maybe attitudes that they were less capable to do a job, go to college or find romance; or a physical barrier, like a sidewalk without a curb cut.That reimagining of what it means to be disabled did gain traction over the years — the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act just three years later in 1990 was a milestone — thanks to leaders like Heumann, who died suddenly on Saturday at age 75 at a hospital in Washington, D.C. She'd been hospitalized the previous weekend with breathing problems. Heumann was a major American civil rights hero who remained little known until a flurry of attention in the last three years of her life. It started with the publication of her autobiography, Being Heumann: An Unrepentant Memoir of a Disability Rights Activist, co-authored with Kristen Joiner and released in February 2020, in the weeks just before the pandemic. The celebration of Heumann took off shortly after with the release of the documentary Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution. Filmmakers James LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham found forgotten film of a summer camp in upstate New York for children with disabilities and used it to smartly explore issues of identity. The young people using wheelchairs and with various disabilities long to be included in a world that rejected them, but also find commonality and pride at a place that's exclusively for them. Heumann, who had attended Camp Jened from the time she was 8 and was a counselor at the time of the original film footage, quickly emerges as the documentary's star — a smart and self-confident organizer.When the ADA marked its 30th birthday, in July of 2020, I and a lot of other journalists dialed up Judy. For NPR, I got Judy to share wisdom with a young activist, Imani Barbarin, who'd been born just four months before the ADA became law. Judy, who was working to spread knowledge of disability civil rights to the moment she died, noted the importance of the new directions of young activists like Barbarin who don't see the ADA as a capstone of rights, but as just a floor for achieving equality.Other events of 2020 helped propel awareness of Heumann's work and the rise of the disability civil rights movement — the killing of George Floyd created discussion of diversity, equity and inclusion, with disabled people insisting it had to include them and the pandemic itself, one of the largest causes of new disability since the spread of polio.Early in life, Heumann's wheelchair was called a fire hazardIn 1949, Judy, the daughter of a New York butcher and his wife, contracted polio. When she was 5 and it was time to go to kindergarten, her parents — German Jewish immigrants — went to register her but were turned away at the nearby public school.It would create a fire hazard, the principal said, to let a girl in a wheelchair go to the school. Her mother, Ilse Heumann, fought to end the isolating and erratic hours — just a few hours a week — of home instruction and eventually Judy was allowed into a school building. Years later, Heumann graduated from college where she studied to become a teacher. Being a speech therapist was one of the few professions, she was told, open to a young woman in a wheelchair. But again, she was deemed a fire hazard. This time, in 1970, New York City's Board of Education ruled that a teacher in a wheelchair would be unable to evacuate children during an emergency and denied her a teaching license. Heumann, having learned from her mother's advocacy, sued. She got support in the local press. ""You Can Be President, Not Teacher, with Polio,"" ran one newspaper story, noting the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. For that story, Heumann told the reporter: ""We're not going to let a hypocritical society give us a token education and then bury us."" Other disabled people around the country saw press coverage and wrote her letters detailing their own discrimination stories. Heumann co-founded Disabled in Action, a protest group modeled on the work of Black civil rights activists, the women's movement and anti-Vietnam War protesters. Heumann's activism expanded in the 1970sIn 1972, Heumann and a small group of DIA demonstrators shut down rush hour traffic on Madison Avenue outside President Richard Nixon's reelection campaign headquarters. They wanted to call attention to Nixon's veto of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, which expanded programs to help people with disabilities.Heumann moved to Berkeley, Calif., the center of a small but growing disability civil rights movement. (When, in 1990, I started writing a book, No Pity: People With Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement, I took my first reporting trip to Berkeley to spend time learning from Judy, Ed Roberts and other leaders.)In 1973, Nixon did sign the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which added milestone language to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities. But the Nixon and Ford administrations did not write the rules required to make that anti-discrimination language operative.When the new administration of Jimmy Carter seemed unsure whether to act, disabled people took over a federal building in San Francisco. The protest, over 26 days in the spring of 1977, was one of the first actions of the rising disability civil rights movement to gain national press attention.Heumann, then 29, emerged as a leader. When California congressmen convened a hearing at the occupied building and a federal official tried to reassure the protesters, Heumann did not let him off easy. ""We will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. We want the law enforced. We will accept no more discussion of segregation,"" she said in a voice that quivered with emotion and indignation. ""And I would appreciate it if you would stop shaking your head in agreement when I don't think you understand what we are talking about.""The protesters forced the Carter administration to implement Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which specified that no government agency, or even a private business, that accepted federal funds could discriminate against someone on the basis of their disability.Section 504 became a model for the ADA which would extend the principles of non-discrimination to all public accommodations, employment, transportation, communications and access to state and local government programs.In her autobiography, Heumann wrote of her excitement to be present on the White House lawn when President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 1990. Although she had criticized the legislation that she thought didn't go far enough to help people, like her, who needed assistance from aides to live at home. Heumann led various disability groups in California. In 1991, she met Jorge Pineda, at a disability conference, and they married the following year. Heumann turned her efforts to working in the government and promoting global disability rightsIn 1993, President Bill Clinton named Heumann — the woman who had once been declared a fire hazard too dangerous to be a student or a teacher — as assistant secretary of education, in charge of all of the nation's federal education programs for students with disabilities. Later, in the Obama administration, she worked as a special assistant to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in charge of spreading ideas about civil rights across the world. The disability civil rights revolution, which Heumann had helped launch in America, was now becoming a democracy export. Between 2000 and 2015, 181 countries passed disability civil rights modeled after the ADA (although many were laws with little power or follow up). In her hulking power wheelchair, Heumann traveled to more than 30 countries to spread the gospel of disability rights. For the 25th anniversary of the ADA in 2015, I followed Judy at a State Department conference in Washington that brought 50 disabled advocates from 33 countries. They treated Judy like a rock star. They posed for selfies and brought her gifts. They sought her advice about closing down abusive orphanages for disabled children and about how to win equal rights for women with disabilities. ""We are slowly changing the world,"" Judy told them. Heumann was sunny and quick to smile, an optimist about the future. But she was also quick to call out discrimination. Heumann appreciated the growing recognition of her work and the way demand for her time had grown starting in 2020. She was generous with that time and kept mentoring young activists around the world. She started a podcast and traveled or, during the pandemic appeared on Zoom, to keep up with a growing demand to hear her speak.""We're simmering to a boil,"" she liked to say about seeing her work for the disability civil rights movement spread into the mainstream and across the globe.

4337,What role will local journalism play in Ukraine's resistance and recovery?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2023/05/29/what-role-will-local-journalism-play-in-ukraines-resistance-and-recovery,"Charlie Sennott, founder and editor-in-chief of the Groundtruth Project, spoke about his trip to Bucha.","The war in Ukraine has been going for almost a year an a half, since Russian troops escalated their invasion in February 2022. Charlie Sennott, founder and editor in chief of the Groundtruth Project, just returned from Kyiv and joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to discuss his experience. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: First of all, Charlie, what took you to Kyiv? Charlie Sennott: So I was there to attend two conferences. The first one was actually in Ukraine. It was in the city of Bucha, which all of us remember as a city that was just ravaged in the very earliest stages of the war. Many experts would say the opening chapter of an indictment on war crimes will be set in Bucha. That was where the bodies were left in the streets, many with their hands tied behind their backs. They had been killed. They had been mutilated. There were allegations of systematic rape and torture. And really, really the worst stuff that we saw right away that would come in even more depth and with even more ferocity later in the war. But this was this was that first scene.So really, I cannot tell you what it was like to go to Bucha for the first annual, as they put it, Bucha Journalism Conference, where they brought together a lot of the journalists who cover the war for the Western media. So The New York Times was there and The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the BBC. But also, and really importantly, it was many of the top Ukrainian journalists who were able to take a moment and pull back to Bucha. And there were 200 local reporters from Ukraine there. And it was really quite a unique gathering, a powerful gathering, a gathering, sort of, of solidarity around the role that journalism will play in actually putting forward the evidence that will be required for a war crimes tribunal or some form of bringing Putin and Russia to account for what they've done in Bucha. If we have time, the scenes there are just amazing, because it's rebuilding and it's coming back. Alston: That sounds really profound, Charlie. And I want to talk more about the role of local journalism there. But as you were leaving, Russia launched its largest drone attack since the beginning of the war on Kyiv, just as the city was preparing to mark Kyiv Day, which celebrates the founding of the city more than 1,500 years ago. What's the mood there? Sennott: The mood is exhausted, and the mood is a sense that this is a fateful hour. There have been large-scale missile attacks, but never until yesterday had there been so many in Kyiv. And that was what made yesterday unique. We've had 40 missile attacks on Ukraine in a single day before, but this was 50 in Kyiv. And so it was really Putin raining chaos and fear down upon the city of Kyiv.And the stunning reality of being there is, you know, the first thing you hear at about three in the morning are air raid sirens going off, which are quickly followed by this sort of thud of the Patriot missiles going out from their positions in and around Kyiv to protect the city. And it's hard for us to know for sure, it's hard to get a lot of ground truth on whether or not those missiles are coming through. But from what the military is saying, 49 out of 50 were knocked out of the sky by the Patriot missile system. And it has been around for a long time. We remember this missile system from the first Gulf War, when it needed improvements. And now I have to say, being there in Kyiv and seeing how effective it is, it's an amazing protective system that is guarding the city. And it appeared to be working yesterday after the sort of pre-dawn hours of typically when the air strikes came in, there were then about a dozen more missile attacks that came in, and drone attacks that came in to Kyiv. And so this was really one of the the absolute worst days. And I thought so much of my colleagues from Ukrainska Pravda, which is one of the leading newspapers in Ukraine, and many others who were leaving that conference and would have been returning yesterday, and what they came home to and what they have to look forward to as the country braces for the counteroffensive, which will, you know, presumably be underway any moment, if not already underway. And my guess is the latter. I think it's already underway in different ways. The whole country feels just like it's bracing for what is the fateful hour in this conflict. Ukraine and the Ukrainian forces are prepared. They're ready to go. They have an arsenal and they have a plan. And the moment is now. And the next weeks, months will be critical. Alston: We should mention that NPR has been reporting this morning that Russia may have been trying to weaken that counteroffensive even before it began. Sennott: And to be more precise, what I think and I've heard they're doing — and it made sense to me — is they're trying to keep those Patriot missiles in Kyiv so that they don't try to move them forward to protect ground forces that will be staging the operation for the counteroffensive. They want them to stay pulled back into Kyiv. The Russians want to keep them in Kyiv, that is. They want to keep those missile systems, those defensive systems, pinned down in Kyiv so they can't be deployed for in a forward way for Ukraine. That makes sense to me. And the surreal thing, Paris, about being in Kyiv in the days that I was there and what I've heard from people overnight is: These missiles come in, they're taken out by the Patriot, and life goes back to normal. And that's in huge air quotes, 'normal.' But you can actually feel that Kyiv is trying very hard to maintain that resiliency, to reflect who it is as a country. And the day they chose to attack yesterday is actually called Kyiv Day. And it celebrates the foundation of the city more than 1,500 years ago. And it's just a profound expression of how ancient the city is, how meaningful it is. And the way it defines that part of the world. Its history is storied and important, and the culture is beautiful and strong. And the people of Ukraine, you can feel it on the ground, are so united in defense of their country. Alston: And really quickly, Charlie, because we're running out of time here. But I do want to hear just in the last maybe 15 seconds we have here, what is the role that local journalism is playing in spite of everything going on? Sennott: Thanks for asking. Local journalism in Ukraine is critical. I mean, imagine if we were at war, we'd need those reports from the Midwest. We'd need those reports from the Mississippi Delta or wherever the attacks might be happening, that we don't have eyes on the ground as a people or as larger news organizations. So they play a very critical role for the local communities, to say what's happening and where things are headed and what services are available and where you need to go and what roads are dangerous, etc. But it's important in another way, which is the local journalism becomes the way in which this country will pull itself back together, I think. And I think really having accountability reporting going forward for Ukraine as all of that money for reconstruction comes in — this is hundreds of billions of dollars, much needed. But local journalism will play an incredibly important role as eyes on the ground, making sure that money is spent the way it was intended to be spent. Corruption is an issue in Ukraine. It always has been. And I think the journalists are incredible at holding those government officials accountable. And I think this gathering was a sort of gathering of strength for journalism to say we have a role to play here on the front lines covering the war, but also in representing local communities. Report for The World, our organization, we partner with Ukrainska Pravda. We're really proud to do it. And it's important work they're doing, of course, but the local angles are as important as the big national reporting.",International News,"Mon, 29 May 2023 14:38:53 EST",55f0468888938ebd0912d346ac24c5a2
1296,Lexington robotics team engineers space for girls to thrive in STEM,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/04/04/lexington-robotics-team-engineers-space-for-girls-to-thrive-in-stem,"The Parity Bits and their robot, Esmerelda, talk about competitions and outreach.","Esmerelda the robot wheeled around the floor, her arms lifting up and down on hydraulics. She scooped up small red-and-blue cones and stacked them onto rods of varying heights, her motors whirring. On the edge of the fenced-in floor, Lexington High School student Anna Labbe gave commands: Up, down, turns and navigations. Her teammates, Nora Kapoor and Arushi Aggarwal, used controllers to drive her around. Esmerelda was designed, programmed and built by members of the Parity Bits, a robotics team for girls and nonbinary students at Lexington High School. Their name is a pun: A parity bit is a form of error-detecting code, added to the end of a string of binary code. It’s also a reference to gender parity in STEM fields. Women make up almost 30 percent of the STEM workforce, according to the professional association STEM Women. The Parity Bits want to increase that number.Esmerelda is about 18 by 18 inches, with purple and gold accents. She weighs about 30 pounds and is made of metal, wood, string and electrical wiring. The Parity Bits take her to competitions, where they and other high school teams see which robot can quickly and most efficiently stack cones. Their mission also extends to outreach: They visit elementary school students, where they present their robots and teach younger students about engineering. The Parity Bits were founded in 2014, born out of a co-ed robotics team at their school, 2 Bits and a Byte, when one member wanted a space for girls to shine — without being overshadowed by the boys.“I started back in fourth grade, but that was because my brother had a team with all of his guy friends,” Defne Olgun said. “And then as I got old enough to join, they were like, Oh, would you like to join us? Because we need girls on our team, so it looks good for the judges. I wasn't always the most confident. I would fiddle around with the Legos, but I wouldn't be the one putting the things onto the robot.”Most of the team had no robotics experience before joining the Parity Bits. Team member Priyanka Iyer says it's a common experience for girls exploring robotics — and that makes wins even more gratifying.“I think that when I’m in a community where my voice feels overshadowed by men, I sometimes don't feel confident in what I have to say, and I think their ideas are better,” Iyer said. “But then to be in an all-girls team and show that it is possible and we can do as much as they can. … To be able to do the same thing and go out and win awards and win matches with them, it feels really cool.”Aggrarwal said they foster an environment for learning, and for feeling secure in being able to practice, fail and try again. “You're not going to be perfect the first time,” Aggrarwal said. “And that's something that I think is hard for newcomers to remember. Part of that was saying to our new team members, you're going to be okay. And if you're not okay the first time, after the fourth or fifth or sixth time, Esmerelda is going to be fine and we're all going to be fine together.”Olgun said they also learn how to overcome challenges together. “Yes, it might suck when the string snaps for the eighth time that day, but you just have to keep going at it again,” Olgun said. “It’s also about sharing space and allowing others to take up as much presence in the room as I might sometimes; to fail on purpose and be okay with that process of growing and learning through the engineering process.”The environment has inspired many of the girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math after high school. Two of the graduating seniors plan to study computer science and robotics, and another plans to study mechanical engineering. They've become close friends along the way, and are leaving a legacy for the underclass girls behind them. “Over the course of the season, we're all trying to learn and grow as a team,” Audi Lin said. “We want to leave as much as we can behind for future generations.” At the end of the season, Esmerelda will be disassembled. Her parts will be used for a new robot next year.",Science and Technology,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 05:00:08 EST",70a3e5dcace611c2098d6b113e2c2822
6926,Advocates call for action on bills to prevent child sexual abuse in schools,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/04/20/advocates-call-for-action-on-bills-to-prevent-child-sexual-abuse-in-schools,"Legislation would close loopholes with the age of consent and screen prospective school employees, speakers and lawmakers said Thursday.","Advocates and abuse survivors on Thursday described a frustrating lack of action on bills they say would make schools safer for students.Massachusetts Citizens for Children executive director Jetta Bernier said her group and other supporters have been pushing for stronger requirement in schools since 2015. ""It's just unconscionable that we are still here, and I'm having to think about public hearings in another few months where we're gonna be asking these survivors to come and share their stories one more time, one more time,"" Bernier said during a virtual advocacy event. ""I'm almost embarrassed to ask them.""Bills highlighted at the event include measures that would require schools to adopt abuse-prevention policies and to screen prospective employees for past allegations or investigations of child abuse and sexual misconduct. Deerfield Rep. Natalie Blais, a sponsor of the employee-screening bill, said it would help schools ""protect students from the really devastating consequences of child sexual abuse and its impact on our families and our communities.""""This legislation really seeks to prevent abusers from being passed from school to school, in an effort to ensure that schools are a safe and supportive environment for all of our children,"" she said. Other bills promoted at Thursday's event would prevent teachers and other authority figures like coaches from using age of consent as a defense in cases in teenage sex abuse cases. In Massachusetts, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16. Sen. Joan Lovely said the bills close a loophole in consent laws by establishing that people younger than 19 — or 22 for special education students — cannot legally consent to sexual relations with adults in a position of authority over them.""Due to the grooming process, the victim may believe at the time that the sexual relationship is consensual and that the abuser loves them and they often will not recognize the grooming [and] abuse until they are an adult in their 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond,"" said Lovely, a Salem Democrat.Lovely is the Senate sponsor of the legislation discussed Thursday and of other bills that aim to prevent child sexual abuse and support its survivors. She told event participants that she was 6 years old when she was sexually abused by an uncle who was living with her family, and said she hears regularly from her constituents and other Massachusetts residents seeking help after a child is abused or assaulted. ""We will continue to push these bills,"" Lovely said. ""We have really refined them and they are really ready for floor action."" Jen Falcone, who recounted her story of abuse as a junior high student, said one challenge in preventing child sexual abuse is ""making this issue talkable."" Many people, she said, are scared or uncomfortable discussing it. ""So many survivors are out there,"" she said. ""So what we've got is, our overall society, we almost have a trauma response to the topic, I believe. So there's kind of this collective trauma around the issue, so when you try to talk to people about the issue, you can see some people shut down right in front of you.""",Politics,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 14:48:39 EST",db9fc9244c10baa4b53473e331a2792c
2571,"Rachael Rollins, a champion of criminal justice reform, was undone by her political activity",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/17/rachael-rollins-a-champion-of-criminal-justice-reform-was-undone-by-her-political-activity,Two federal investigations found she leaked information to help Ricardo Arroyo's race for Suffolk County DA.,"Editor’s note: After learning that he is referenced in a Department of Justice report on U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, and given that he has commented on air about her tenure, GBH News has suspended Daniel Medwed from his role as an on-air legal analyst, while we conduct an internal review.SeparatorOver the past several years, U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins has become a leading — and polarizing — figure in a national movement to confront racial disparities in the criminal justice system. But it was politics, not policy, that unraveled her career, leading her to announce Tuesday that she will resign at the end of the week.Two scathing reports issued Wednesday by federal investigators found that Rollins used her position to try to help Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo’s campaign to replace her as Suffolk County district attorney, including leaking information to the press to suggest the Justice Department was investigating his opponent in that race, then-acting District Attorney Kevin Hayden. The Office of Special Counsel and the Justice Department’s inspector general both concluded that, despite serving as U.S. attorney, Rollins was a de facto campaign advisor to Arroyo. Rollins was apparently concerned that Hayden was going to roll back her efforts to reduce prosecutions of low-level offenders.Late Wednesday, Arroyo released a statement saying he was not contacted during the federal investigations. He said he reviewed the reports after their release and noted neither ""allege any wrongdoing on my part.""In addition, Rollins attended a Democratic Party fundraiser in July 2022 in Andover, Massachusetts, where First Lady Jill Biden was in attendance, “while on duty, in her official capacity, and using a government vehicle” — even though she had been advised by her own staff and by Justice Department officials not to attend, according to the Office of Special Counsel report. Rollins then claimed to investigators she was there to attend a U.S. Attorney’s Office event in Andover, not the fundraiser, which is “wholly contradicted by the evidence.” While it is not uncommon for executive branch officials to be accused of violating the Hatch Act, which basically prohibits them from being involved in partisan political activity, the Office of Special Counsel said in its report Wednesday that Rollins’ actions “are among the most egregious transgressions of the act that [the office] has ever investigated.” Rollins is not the first person to be forced out of the Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office. In 1989, conservative Republican Frank McNamara Jr. — appointed by Ronald Reagan — resigned less than two years into his term after it was revealed he had falsely told federal investigators that his predecessor William Weld had smoked marijuana while serving as U.S. attorney. Twenty-eight of the prosecutors on McNamara’s staff had written to then-Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asking for McNamara’s removal.But while McNamara was a non-controversial figure who had been confirmed by the Senate unanimously, Rollins was a lightning rod of controversy whose monthslong confirmation process was rescued only by the intervention of Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a 50-50 tie in the Senate — twice.Rollins was known as a leader in the movement to address structural racism in the criminal justice system. As district attorney, she famously published a list of 15 low-level offenses that her office would not prosecute, such as trespassing, shoplifting and non-violent drug offenses. “In addition to being low-level, non-violent offenses with minimal long-term impact, they are most commonly driven by poverty, substance use disorder, mental health issues, trauma histories, housing or food insecurity, and other social problems rather than specific malicious intent,” she wrote in a March 2019 policy memo.Rollins advised prosecutors in the memo to take a broader view of both the social circumstances of defendants and the long-term consequences of being dragged into the criminal justice system.“A criminal record often presents barriers to education, future income, housing, and many other necessary assets and supports proven to help people thrive and succeed in society,” she wrote. To paint Democrats as a pro-crime party, Republicans jumped on the list and Rollins’ public concerns about police misconduct. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas led the opposition to her confirmation, calling Rollins “one of the most preeminent legal arsonists in the country,” and saying she had “nothing but contempt for the rule of law.”“When crime spikes in Massachusetts and crime spikes in New Hampshire, Democratic senators who are on the ballot next year are going to answer for it,” Cotton said at the time.The vote to move Rollins' nomination to the floor and the final vote on approval both deadlocked at 50-50, which led Harris to cast the deciding vote each time.Violent crime in Massachusetts rose 8% between 2021 and 2022. There has been no spike in crime since Rollins took office in January 2022.Still, Rollins’ resignation represents a setback for some prominent Massachusetts politicians who backed her at pivotal moments in her career. In April 2019, when Rollins was still Suffolk County district attorney, she sparred publicly with then-Gov. Charlie Baker's administration over her approach to criminal justice. At a rally at Dorchester's Prince Hall Lodge at the time, then-Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu sat on stage just to Rollins’ right and applauded after Rollins told the crowd, “I’m not here to fight with people, but get out of my way. We are changing the system.” In December 2021, after Rollins was confirmed as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts after a bitter battle in the Senate, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren released a statement to note that they'd recommended Rollins for the job and predicting that she would bring ""renewed energy and innovative vision"" to the role. After news of Rollins’ impending resignation broke this week, Wu, Markey and Warren all spoke positively about her legacy. In contrast, Massachusetts Republican Party chair Amy Carnevale used Rollins’ exit to hit Democrats on criminal justice, saying in a statement that “[t]he dangerous pro-crime and anti-police stands embraced by [Rollins] made her the wrong choice from the beginning.” After the release of the investigative reports Wednesday, Markey and Warren issued a joint statement saying: “These findings are deeply troubling and we agree with Rollins’s decision to resign. It’s powerfully important that public officials follow high ethical standards and the Justice Department’s work on behalf of Massachusetts will continue uninterrupted.”Watch: Former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Michael Sullivan and GBH News Senior Investigative Reporter Philip Martin discuss the significance of the findingsOne of Rollins' major initiatives as district attorney had been a push to overturn wrongful convictions that occurred under previous district attorneys.Rollins declined to pursue a lingering gun charge against Sean Ellis, whose wrongful conviction was highlighted in a Netflix documentary and who served 22 years behind bars. In 2020, she went before the state's Supreme Judicial Court and asked for a new trial for Robert Foxworth, imprisoned for 30 years for a 1991 murder for which he maintained his innocence. Rollins requested that Foxworth be immediately released because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That same year, however, Rollins raged against a court’s decision to release due to the pandemic a Dorchester man accused of stabbing a friend to death following an argument. SInce being elected to replace Rollins as Suffolk County district attorney, Hayden has maintinted the unit that reviews wrongful conviction claims, though advocates raised concerns last year when the head of the unit was replaced.As U.S. attorney, Rollins had less independent authority; nonetheless, she established a hotline for reporting incidents of hate and created a civil rights and human trafficking unit in her criminal division to prosecute cases involving civil rights violations, including hate crimes, human trafficking, and police use of excessive force. Several high-profile cases were also prosecuted during her term, including that of Shaun Harrison, aka “Rev,” a former academic dean in the Boston Public Schools who was secretly a member of the Massachusetts Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (Latin Kings). Harrison was sentenced this month to 18 years behind bars on racketeering charges. For many, this and other prosecutions of serious crimes during her terms as U.S. attorney and district attorney, as well cases rendered during her tenure as an assistant U.S. prosecutor from 2007 to 2011, belied detractors’ description of Rollins as “pro-criminal. ” But the term has become a political talking point on the right to hammer criminal reform advocates, and to Rollins’ enemies, she embodied the worst within that category.

4681,Why more Pride parades are popping up in Massachusetts' small cities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/31/why-more-pride-parades-are-popping-up-in-massachusetts-small-cities,"Organizers want LGBTQ+ residents to feel at home in small towns and cities like Newburyport, not just major urban centers.","On a blindingly bright morning, Paul Goldberg looked up a main street in downtown Newburyport, pointing out the route he helped plan for the small city's first Pride parade. This Saturday, the inaugural event will step off from the old court house. “We’ll walk down Green Street to the end,” he said, turning to look north, “cross over to the waterfront there and walk along the boardwalk, just a short way into Waterfront Park.” Just over a year ago, it’s an event that would’ve been a distant dream in the city of less than 20,000. Last May, plans for a queer youth dance were thrown into chaos when the venue, a local Masonic lodge, abruptly pulled out less than two weeks before the event. The social organization’s statewide leadership had gone over members’ heads and called off the dance, seemingly over concerns about hosting an event for LGBTQ+ youth with a drag queen. But just as quickly, Newburyport’s community responded with a rush of support. Five venues offered up their spaces. Locals put together a welcoming wall of neighbors, where more than a hundred people showed up to wave flags, celebrate and stand in solidarity with the high schoolers. And the Masonic lodge went against orders: they hosted the dance anyway. It was a turning point for the city. Beyond Newburyport, organizers in small towns and cities across Massachusetts are making a concerted push for their queer neighbors feel seen and supported in their own communities, without having to go to the nearest big city. And it’s an effort that’s taken on additional meaning amid a national rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation in state legislatures. “After the ‘Over the Rainbow’ dance last May, we kind of reflected on everything that had happened — and the biggest takeaway was just this overwhelming outpouring of support from the community for our young people,” said Tarah MacGregor, who is now one of the Newburyport Pride board chairs. “We were like, ‘OK, Newburyport needs a Pride, right?’” she said. The nine-person committee in Newburyport, which had its first official meeting in December, is now putting the finishing touches on a dozen events, including a flag-raising with Gov. Maura Healey. “Every time somebody attacks our kids, it backfires ... because the community comes back with more love and more support than we could ever have imagined,” said James Giessler, who leads NAGLY, the North Shore Alliance of GLBT Youth. It co-sponsored last year’s dance. “As we see in Newburyport, with all the ruckus that they had, now they’re going to have one of the most spectacular Pride observations on the North Shore.” The Pride celebrations popping up in smaller cities and towns often take cues from the original marches, which were political protests in major cities that go back 50 years to commemorate the Stonewall riots. But today, these smaller Prides focus more on celebration, promoting visibility and making residents feel safe. Newburyport is far from Massachusetts’ first Pride outside of Boston; it’s not even the first Pride on the North Shore. Hope Watt-Bucci wanted to fight back against hate in her own community after she witnessed an older gay couple being mocked in a local restaurant and heard stories of homophobic taunts and assaults circulated on the North Shore. So, in 2012, she founded North Shore Pride and its first parade marched through Salem that June. Watt-Bucci remembered thinking she’d be glad if a hundred people came to the group’s first event. “Thousands of people showed up,” she recalled. “And I thought that, ‘OK, yeah, we need to do this. We clearly need to do this.’”Last year’s parade in Salem attracted 20,000 celebrants. Enough Pride celebrations have cropped up over the last decade that Watt-Bucci started what she calls the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together organizers from different North Shore celebrations. She and a dozen other organizers gathered on a recent Tuesday evening at a Beverly restaurant. It was a logistics-dominated evening, talking through event insurance, food trucks and 501c3 paperwork. But the room often burst into applause as organizers reveled in the dozens of events that would be held in cities and towns across the North Shore in June: drag queen bingo in Wenham, youth Pride in Lynn and a flurry of flag-raisings. This year, Topsfield is hosting Tri-town Pride for the second year with Boxford and Middleton — though it’s the first year they’ll have a parade — in response to a protest at a Boxford drag queen story hour last year. A formalized nonprofit is organizing Pride in Lynn for the first time. Revere will host its second annual “Beach Pride.” Wenham and Hamilton will have their third joint Pride picnic. Swampscott had its first Pride in 2020, and this year there’s a new addition: a “Run with Pride” 5k. Parades and other celebrations are often just “the tip of the iceberg” of deeper changes in the towns that are hosting them, according to Kim Creasap, who researches small-town Pride events in the Midwest. She’s found Ohio towns where organizers are celebrating the passage of a local ordinance, scaling up the reach of local support groups or hoping that a big celebration could be an economic boon. “There was actually a lot of advocacy behind the scenes leading up to Pride,” Creasap said, referencing those Midwestern cities and towns. “So, in other words, the Pride parades — or picnics, or festivals — were kind of a more visible consequence of a less visible community organizing that has been going on.” Joan Ilacqua leads The History Project, which preserves archives of New England’s LGBTQ+ history. She thinks part of the reason that more towns are hosting Prides is to fill the “vacuum” left by Boston Pride, which last hosted a parade in 2019, and that the increase in small-town and small-city Prides is the sign of a real shift. “People are feeling more comfortable being visible where they are, being in community with their neighbors,” Ilacqua said. “It kind of proves that you don't have to go away to the big city to be part of the queer community.”In Wenham, the third annual Pride flag raising is being organized by the city’s human rights committee. Martha Brennan, the chair, thought back to when the committee was first formed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, with the goal of making residents of all backgrounds feel more welcome in town. “One of the really endearing things that happened after our first flag raising was that a lesbian couple said it was the first time that they felt comfortable walking down the street holding hands because there’s not a lot of visibility,” Brennan recalled, referring to her town with 5,000 residents. “It’s a very small town and people are unsure of what others are thinking. And so it’s a nice way to signal that everybody’s welcome.” For Newburyport, this new chapter started with a difficult launching-off point, but one that many community members are glad to turn into a positive change for their city.The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in a written reply to GBH News, said it decided that it was not the right organization to hold the event, and that it would have been better suited for a school or public building. Last year, members of the Masonic lodge, which had initially canceled the queer youth dance on the organizers, ended up rebelling against the statewide organization.“The feeling was overwhelming, knowing that we were providing a safe space for them,” Michael Switzer, the former leader of the St. John’s Lodge, said when he thought back on that night last spring. “Knowing that even an ounce of that discrimination and pain that they felt came from our organization, we knew that we had to do the right thing.” It came with consequences. Many of the local Masons were reprimanded, suspended or expelled from the organization for their decision. But Switzer and others decided to form a new social club called the Wolfe Club that, this year, is sponsoring Newburyport Pride and is planning its own event to raise more funds for the Pride committee. “It’s really been fulfilling for us to come full circle,” Switzer said. “When you’re an ally and you make a sacrifice, it doesn’t have to be a sad, negative story. ... And it’s really been amazing to see what we’ve been able to accomplish in a year.” Seventeen-year-old Sully McLellan was one of the high schoolers at last year’s dance — one of at least 100 kids. “There was more food than we needed. We had, like, pints of ice cream that was donated that were never broken into,” he said. “It was just a really good experience. And the drag queen was really good, too.”This year, the youth dance will be held at City Hall. McLellan is taking the lead on organizing with a blacklight, outer-space theme. Members of the new Wolfe Club will be stationed outside, donning shirts that read “safety and support.” Hundreds of T-shirts and stickers are on their way for people and businesses around town to advertise their LGBTQ+ pride, and groups are readying to march their way down Green Street to the city’s waterfront on Saturday.For parade co-chair MacGregor, who grew up in a New Hampshire town just across the border from Newburyport, it’s coming full circle, too. “Growing up as a young queer person, I didn’t feel like I had community. And being able to be part of this volunteer mission, to create community where there is so much support and where young people can grow up and see these events happening and feel valued by their community?” she said. “That’s the goal.”",Local,"Wed, 31 May 2023 05:00:29 EST",cdbbfabf364193f3888c91adad2fa96c
1502,"Still in Senate limbo, acting US Labor Secretary Su says she’s ‘embedding equity in everything we do’",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/01/still-in-senate-limbo-acting-us-labor-secretary-su-says-shes-embedding-equity-in-everything-we-do,"At the NAACP convention Tuesday, Su staked out a pro-union stance and zeroed in on closing the racial wealth gap.","As labor union organizing efforts continue to gain steam and the economy slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, “the fight for workers’ rights and civil rights go hand in hand,” according to acting U.S. labor secretary Julie Su. She spoke at the national NAACP convention in Boston’s Seaport Tuesday, alongside her predecessor (and former mayor of Boston) Marty Walsh, at a panel focused on labor. Su, who started in the role in March, has been serving in an “acting” capacity with the support of the Biden administration without confirmation from Senate. She carved out a strong pro-union stance in her Tuesday speech, saying her department will be “embedding equity” in all of its work and pitched her support for unions as a tool to close the racial wealth gap. She emphasized the importance of job access and building wealth for Black Americans. “There's been a continual exclusion from the full promise of economic opportunity and prosperity,” Su said in her remarks. “We are pulling every lever we have at the Department of Labor to change that.” To Su, that means investing and building up apprenticeship programs, promoting trades, empowering labor unions and financially supporting Black-owned businesses. “From the first time I came into the Department of Labor, I asked, ‘What are we doing to uplift Black workers?’” Su said in an interview Tuesday with GBH News. “I don’t think you can build the economy that the president envisions without paying attention to the inequities that Black workers have faced.” The average Black and Hispanic or Latino households own about 15 to 20% as much net wealth and earn about half as much as the average white household, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Due to the racial wealth gap, experts project that the U.S. economy will ultimately lose out on $1 to $1.5 trillion dollars in spending between 2019 and 2028. Since taking over for Walsh, Su’s role has been precarious and controversial. The acting labor secretary first joined the department in 2021 as deputy secretary, coming from California, where she led the state’s unemployment agency. Now, she’s spent nearly six months in Senate limbo, waiting for a stalled confirmation vote as Republicans have called on President Joe Biden to withdraw his nomination. Su has been criticized as an “activist” in an ongoing national war between labor unions and corporate interests. Her opponents have also criticized her leadership of California’s unemployment agency during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more than one million legitimate applicants had delayed or frozen claims and at least $20 billion was fraudulently acquired by scammers. While Su does not appear to have the Senate votes to be officially confirmed, sources in the Biden administration believe she’s entitled to stay in her current “acting” role indefinitely Last month, Biden indicated that she’s not going anywhere. Walsh took a similar tack when he introduced Su at the NAACP. “Now, they have ‘acting’ in front of her name. That’s B.S., there’s no acting,” he said. “She's been doing the job, she's been fighting for workers in America, and she's been traveling this country.” But some are still challenging her legal authority. Last month, Flex Association, a trade group representing app-based companies including DoorDash, GrubHub, Lyft and Uber, sent a letter to the Biden administration arguing that rules and regulations issued under Su lack constitutional authority and political power. Su told GBH News Tuesday that she and Biden “will still work for confirmation, but not be confined by that process.”“I'm privileged to get to do it, and my plan is to keep on doing it,” Su said. “The president has said that he wants me to be in that position to do it.” When asked what she's taken away from California’s challenges with unemployment payments during the pandemic, Su said the Biden administration is investing in state infrastructure to “do what needs to be done to build a stronger system for next time.” Even before the pandemic, the unemployment insurance benefit program “was like a house with a leaky roof,” Su said. “It didn’t have the technology or the flexibility that was needed, and frankly, many of those benefits are not enough in hard times. Once COVID hit, it was like a situation where you can’t change the roof in the middle of a storm.” The pandemic sparked a “labor moment” in “industries that were long-shots for a long time,” Su said, referencing a national wave of Starbucks union drives and a vote in May to unionize at an electric bus manufacturing facility in rural Georgia. “Some of it is workers seizing a moment, especially coming out of a pandemic in which workers saw how essential they were,” Su said. “But without some basic protections like paid leave, we can and we have to do better.” The labor wave is “exciting,” Su said, and “demonstrates what is possible: workers are given a real chance to organize and come together to demand better working conditions.” Biden and top officials across his administration are embracing the power of unions. Last year in Boston, Vice President Kamala Harris said she and the president are “determined to lead the most pro-union administration in America's history.” “I’m so proud to lead the Department of Labor under the most pro-union, pro-worker president in history,” Su said during her speech. “We all know that when we center equity and everything we do, all workers thrive because equity and excellence go hand in hand.” She cited a 2022 study from the congressional joint Economic Committee showing that union members earn an average of 10% more than their non-union peers. The difference increased for Black workers, who earn an average of 17% more, and Latino workers, who earn 23% higher salaries on average. “Union organizing is one of the most important ways to strengthen and expand the Black middle class,” she said during her NAACP remarks. “We talk a lot in this country about the value of a college education. But a union job increases lifetime earnings more than a college degree does.” Though Su has been criticized by Congressional Republicans for her support of labor unions, she’s open about her work to strengthen protections for workers and unions. “I really respect the collective bargaining process ... and the desire and choice to form a union is up to workers, full stop,” Su said. “But I also think continuing economic policies that create good jobs and that create upward incentives on wages and working conditions is a good thing for all workers.” Su began her legal career at the Asian-Pacific American Legal Center and served as litigation director for the nonprofit civil rights organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Los Angeles. Su represented garment workers in the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case in the 1990s, in which she secured visas for victims of human trafficking. It opened up a new legal avenue for attorneys and advocates and ultimately led to Congress creating a new kind of visa to protect victims of crimes. She later became California’s labor commissioner and, in 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed her to lead the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, which oversees unemployment payments. While her Senate confirmation remains stalled, Su remains focused on what she can do in her current position. “As long as I am your acting labor secretary, it will be my top priority to make sure that we are embedding equity in everything we do,” Su said during her remarks. “For those of us who get to step into positions that are not seen as available to us at the beginning, when we get there, watch out. Because we do make it count.”",National,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 23:28:18 EST",8ea5581292e9bf4db7e22c29da1109ad
5229,Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has another big problem: He won't shut up,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/26/disgraced-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-has-another-big-problem-he-wont-shut-up,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, isn't doing himself any favors.","Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, isn't doing himself any favors. Despite being charged with orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history and facing the prospect of spending his life in prison, he has been tweeting and giving interviews with media — all in an attempt to defend himself in the court of public opinion.It's an unusual strategy for a high-profile criminal defendant who oversaw a company that lost billions of dollars of customer money. And it has left lawyers not involved in the case aghast, since each quotation and tweet from Bankman-Fried is effectively a gift to prosecutors, who can use that material to build their case against him.""I think every white-collar lawyer you could ask would say, 'Shut up: Keep your mouth shut, and let us do the talking,'"" says Rebecca Mermelstein, a partner at the law firm O'Melveny.Through a spokesman, Bankman-Fried declined NPR's request for an interview. Bankman-Fried in trouble over political donationsThe trail of communication — including eight tweets, a Substack newsletter, and a handful of lengthy interviews with the media — that Bankman-Fried has left behind is already coming back to haunt him.For example, a few weeks before Bankman-Fried was arrested, crypto vlogger Tiffany Fong interviewed him by phone, and the conversation turned to Bankman-Fried's campaign contributions. (He reportedly donated about $40 million during the 2022 midterms.)During that interview, Bankman-Fried admitted to Fong that he had steered money to candidates in a way that is difficult to track.""All my Republican donations were dark,"" he told Fong. ""And the reason was not for regulatory reasons. It's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to a Republican. They're all super liberal, and I didn't want to have that fight. So, I made all the Republican ones dark.""Those comments to Fong proved unwise.Bankman-Fried was later charged with eight criminal counts, including including wire fraud and ""conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions.""Then, on Thursday, when federal prosecutors unveiled four additional criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, they included new details about their widening case against him.In the latest indictment, prosecutors specifically cited the comments from that interview as part of their additional evidence for their charge on ""unlawful political contributions.""That may not be all. Lawyers warn prosecutors could use more of the comments he's made during his trial, which is set to start in October.Curtailing his communicationsIt's not just interviews that have landed Bankman-Fried in trouble. He has also been reaching out to current employees of FTX, and that could lead to more consequences.Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried used an encrypted messaging app on Jan. 15, to contact the general counsel of FTX's U.S. subsidiary.""I would really love to reconnect and see if there's a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,"" they say he wrote. ""I'd love to get on a phone call sometime soon and chat.""After that message came to light, the judge overseeing the trial imposed new restrictions on Bankman-Fried's bail, prohibiting him from sending encrypted messages and others that disappear after they are read, and he restricted Bankman-Fried from contacting current and former employees of FTX. Why lawyers want their defendants to keep quietAlthough Bankman-Fried has not made a public comment since Jan. 19, lawyers who have dealt with prominent white-collar defendants warn that it can be a challenge to keep them quiet for long, especially if they are accustomed to living in the spotlight. That's a potential problem for Bankman-Fried, who hobnobbed with people like former President Clinton and former quarterback Tom Brady at the height of his popularity.Former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade says she's seen defendants struggle with the temptation to talk, especially politicians who have found themselves embroiled in scandal.""'If I could just talk to you long enough, I can explain it all away,'"" she imagines a defendant thinking. ""'And I can tell you that I was doing was perfectly legitimate.'""It's an approach that lawyers see at play in this case.In his public pronouncements, the former CEO of FTX has sought to defend himself by saying he did not intend to spark losses for customers of FTX, and maintaining, above all else, that he's not a bad guy.For example, days before Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked him if he felt it was fair for people to compare him to Bernie Madoff, one of the world's most infamous fraudsters. ""I don't think that's who I am at all,"" Bankman-Fried replied. ""But I understand why they're saying that. People lost money, and people lost a lot of money.""Reminders of the 'Pharma Bro'Bankman-Fried may not believe he is like Madoff, but he reminds lawyers of another young, disgraced CEO who couldn't keep quiet before his trial: ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli.He first sparked controversy after his company bought the rights to a drug used to treat people with compromised immune systems, and then spiked the price dramatically.Shkreli was later charged with securities fraud, and instead of laying low, he courted even more notoriety in the days leading up to his trial. He got into a public feud with the rapper Ghostface Killah and did several broadcast interviews against his lawyer's advice. Then, when his trial got underway, Shkreli wandered into the press room and badmouthed the prosecution to reporters. That led to a court-imposed gag order, and his defense attorney couldn't hide his frustration in a widely seen video of them leaving the courthouse.Little upside to talkingJust like it backfired for Shkreli, public relation experts also see little upside for Bankman-Fried in talking.Fred Garcia, who teaches crisis management at New York University and Columbia University, says he can't understand what Bankman-Fried ""hopes to get out of it.""""Other than simply to call attention to himself for reasons I can't quite fathom,"" Garcia says.And the public image that helped Bankman-Fried gain notoriety as a twenty-something CEO could now work against him. He became widely known for wearing shorts and t-shirts, and famously played a video game during a pitch meeting with a prominent venture capital firm. But Anthony D'Angelo, a professor of public relations at Syracuse University, says that persona is unlikely to play well any longer among FTX customers, now that they fear their fortunes have disappeared.""Unorthodox is okay,"" D'Angelo says. ""Losing $8 billion among people is not, and whatever charm your cargo shorts and frizzy hair may give you an advantage in in other forums, it's not going to help here.""

6610,Immunocompromised patients feel unsafe as Boston hospitals drop universal masking,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/17/immunocompromised-patients-feel-unsafe-as-boston-hospitals-drop-universal-masking,"At Mass General Brigham, patients can ask doctors to mask up, but compliance is not guaranteed.","Samantha Webster wears a mask in indoor spaces, even when she's the only one. The 29-year-old graduate student with rheumatoid arthritis says she felt safe from COVID-19 when she went to the hospital for care, knowing she could count on medical personnel to take the same precautions. But last week, the federal government ended the public health emergency — and with it the requirement for hospital personnel and other patients to wear masks. Now Webster is scared of getting sick from a place meant to care for her.“I just think a lot of people don’t really know the challenges that immunocompromised people are facing,” Webster recently told GBH News. “They don’t truly know the danger that this poses.” Webster is among a number of people in Massachusetts concerned about how the ending of the federal and state emergency will affect them. In a series of interviews with GBH News, people said they are worried about going to appointments in hospitals no longer tracking hospital-acquired infections, because they can't assess the risk of catching coronavirus from going to a medical appointment. They’re also troubled about not being able to access some of the silver linings of the public health emergencies, like insurance-covered telehealth appointments, free vaccinations and free COVID-19 tests. Across the state, most hospitals are changing their masking policies, or dropping universal masking entirely. Among the major hospitals and health networks doing away with universal masking are Boston Medical Center, Mass General Brigham, Tufts Medicine, Children’s Hospital of Boston, Beth Israel Lahey, Cambridge Health Alliance and UMass Memorial Health.Ronny Bachrach, a Newton resident whose 4-year-old daughter is treated at Boston Children’s Hospital for systemic arthritis, said she's worried about heading back to six-hour infusions she attends with her daughter every few weeks. Her daughter’s providers are “receptive” to masking, she said, and she’s told that patients can ask providers to mask, but she is still nervous.“We spent this entire pandemic masked with other providers in the room,” said Bachrach. “I just couldn't imagine all of a sudden right now thinking it's OK to stop.” Mass General Brigham created a stir last week when it posted on its website, and sent to patients in its portal, a question-and-answer section including this: The wording enraged lawyer and disability activist Matthew Cortland, who filed a complaint with the civil rights divisions of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services.“It's a blatant violation of federal disability, civil rights laws, and also the laws of the commonwealth of Massachusetts,” Cortland told GBH News. The hospital eventually took the language down from its site. Hospital officials released a statement, saying they “are committed to ensuring that patients can access medical care in a safe and appropriate manner,” and “patients can ask, but providers determine when and if masking in a particular situation is clinically necessary.”Cortland doesn’t feel this is enough. “I want them to post an affirmative explanation of how disabled patients can ask staff to mask,” Cortland said. “MGB must mitigate the harm their bad info caused and demonstrate a commitment to complying with civil rights law.” Webster said when she heard of Mass General Brigham's original language online, she called the hospital for clarification about what would happen if she chooses to ask staff to mask.“They said it could result in the security being called, which seems like a little bit of an overreaction,” she said. “I didn't mean to be hostile in any way. I just want to know how best to protect myself when I do go to the hospital.”Mark Murphy, senior director of external communication at the hospital system, told GBH News that Webster was misinformed. “To clarify, patients would not be escorted out by security if they were to simply ask staff to mask,” he said in an emailed message.Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity is raising awareness about patients and providers’ concerns about COVID exposure and how the end of the public health emergencies impact that, as part of a national campaign this week. They're reaching out to legislators, hospitals and public health agencies. About 6.2% of people age 18 to 64 are immunocompromised in the United States, according to a 2020 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The MGB policy that is, quote, 'your provider will decide if you need others to mask in your presence' is problematic and discriminatory and racist given the history of what we have seen in the medical system,” said Dr. Lara Jirmanus, co-founder of the organization. Jirmanus said many patients are trying to get accommodations to require providers to wear masks around them. She’s heard no word of their success. “I personally have actually done so on the phone and was told by an MGB staff person that I didn't have to worry about COVID anymore because it wasn't a big deal,” she said. Mass General Brigham confirmed they have received complaints over the new policy and said they are responding to those individuals. The hospital system added that patients can direct concerns about masking to the providers in charge of their care.Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Association, said her organization supports a more nuanced approach to masking. For example, she said UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester will keep masks in higher-risk settings like the emergency and oncology departments. “The end of universal masking policies in health care settings will put those seeking medical care who are already more vulnerable — people with respiratory diseases or cancer, people with disabilities, and older adults — at risk of contracting COVID and other potentially life-threatening illnesses,” she said. Other medical facilities and local governments around the United States, including Seattle, Los Angeles County and hospitals in New York — will continue to require masking at hospitals. In Boston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute says is also will still require universal masking.""We know that many area hospitals are moving away from this requirement, but at Dana-Farber we see many patients who have weakened immune systems due to illness or their treatment,"" a hospital newsletter said. COVID-19 has killed nearly 1,500 people in Massachusetts since January, according to state data. It’s still the third leading cause of death in the United States. Just this year, over 4,400 people contracted COVID-19 in a Massachusetts hospital, according to federal data.And it’s not just the lack of masking that worries people. Artist Mary Jirmanus Saba says she’s worried about losing benefits like telehealth and finding free COVID-19 tests. She’s on MassHealth and lives with an autoimmune condition and prediabetes. “How am I, a high-risk person, supposed to protect my family if I don't have access to the tools?” the Malden resident said. She uses telehealth extensively, and even has a physical therapist she can see that way. She tests often to keep herself and the many immunocompromised members of her multigenerational household safe, but she said the high costs of rapid tests and PCR tests make it unaffordable to continue testing at the frequency she had been.“What we're seeing happening is that disabled people are being shut out of public life,” she said.",Local,"Wed, 17 May 2023 05:00:13 EST",25b5c1829f76c4dc8ecf5ae5d3ee0483

He grew up in Washington state and decided to attend university in Los Angeles to pursue a career in show business. His success story began when a comic dropped out of covering the ""Ocean’s 11"" red carpet premiere and he was sent to fill in. He was chosen for his sense of humor and passion for pop culture. “It was totally authentic and it’s always been authentic,"" Mathews said. ""I think I carried that with me through the E! Red carpets, 'Chelsea Lately,' 'RuPaul’s Drag Race,' even still on 'The Drew Barrymore Show' over two decades later, I’m just grateful.”He currently co-hosts the beloved 'Drew Barrymore Show' and spoke about how he connected with her over the pandemic. “I went through a tough time losing my mom in the pandemic you know. Drew was all alone in the studio and it was a weird time to launch the show,"" Mathews said. ""I popped into the show for a day and it’s like we needed each other. It was instant family and I just never left. I wasn’t supposed to stick around. But I never left and now I get to co-host that show with her every single day and she’s become like a sister, she was the flower girl at my wedding.”Besides partnering with Drew Barrymore on her show, Mathews partnered with Days Inn to launch a ""complimentary’ mirror"" that plays a compliment in Mathews’ voice out loud when hotel guests press a button. He said there are currently 16 locations across the country where you can ask for a room with a complimentary mirror.The mirror is just another way Mathews spreads positivity to people. “My purpose here is just to sort of give people a little smile,"" he said. ""If you’re on the road and you’re driving across the country and stay at a Days Inn, it’ll give you a little giggle when you press a little button and get a compliment.” Mathews described the mirror as a “little milestone of success” because what was once used against him, is now a tool to inspire others. “People told me I could never be on TV because of my voice and now I’m partnering with big brands to use my voice ... that’s a full circle kind of thing.” Now, to mark another milestone, he has a stand-up comedy show at The Wilbur on June 9th titled “I Gotchu, Gurl!”His interactive show will be a space where everyone is welcome and meant to have fun. After one of his first shows on tour, a person came up to him and said, “I didn’t know that I needed to laugh like that again. It’s been too long.” “I’m doing my stand-up you know, it’s me on stage. After the past few years, it’s been a little rough for everybody. And I know more than ever we got to have each other’s back and that’s what this celebrates,"" Mathews said.",Local,"Tue, 23 May 2023 16:42:27 EST",c699f695fbe48e013cdad0ce38478a4e

They may not have strong credit histories or valuable collateral to put up for a loan, and they may not have relationships with banks that can help them get in the door.The Equity Alliance for Business — a new program assembled by Eastern Bank and several non-profits that serve minority-and LGBTQ-owned businesses — is hoping to change that by radically lowering the barriers to bank loans for disadvantaged entrepreneurs.The idea is that minority/woman/LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs who are being supported and trained by groups including the Black Economic Council of Massachuetts and the Massachusetts LGBT Chamber of Commerce can use those relationships to lower the requirements for a small business loan from Eastern Bank.“For loans, up to $100,000, when the business is partnering with one of our community referral organizations, that they've either gone through a technical assistance program or they have been doing other training and development with those nonprofits … we have actually eliminated the minimum credit score requirement,” said Quincy Miller, Eastern Bank president.Under federal “fair banking” rules, all borrowers are required to meet the same criteria for getting a loan, but Miller said that winds up creating unfair outcomes, because, for example, a minority entrepreneur may not have the credit history or collateral that a white borrower with generational wealth can bring to the table. The result of applying identical criteria is a disparity in who gets loans.Miller said it took Eastern Bank a year to prove this disparity to federal regulators, which allowed them to open a “special purpose credit program,” creating lower thresholds for disadvantaged businesses to qualify for the same loans — including reducing and in some cases doing away with a credit score requirement. That, he said, “is pretty groundbreaking.”The key, Miller said, is working with partner organizations that train and mentor small businesses, and that can provide a kind of “character reference” that the businesses are ready for the financing. Those nonprofits “spend every day helping to invest back into women-owned businesses, community businesses of color, etc.” he said. “They have those relationships. We're leveraging the character aspect of credit, which is an important aspect, not just the numbers part of credit.”Karla Morales, who runs a Marlborough-based cleaning service called Your Home Detox and a website called Bohio Clean to connect other cleaners to new clients, is the first to get a loan under the new program. Morales — who currently employs 10 people — said her vision is to run an eco-friendly cleaning service and also “ethically connect” potential customers and cleaning service providers, to help “ensure that people who work in the cleaning industry are getting paid for the work that they do.” But she first needed financing to keep that vision moving forward.“We were constantly denied by other banks,” Morales said. Because she didn't have credit history at the time and since the business was new and did not have a track record, “it was difficult for me to get capital.” Morales got a $100,000 loan that she plans to use for sales and marketing, as well as to have a cushion to cover costs when commercial customers are slow paying their bills.Daniel Vidaña, president of Innovation Studio, a local small-business incubator, said the new credit offering from Eastern Back is a big step forward, but it is not a magic solution for everyone.Vidaña said that even Eastern can’t give a loan to an entrepreneur who has not registered their business, set up a company bank account or who hasn’t been sending invoices to customers. These are things that the community organizations like his can help entrepreneurs put in place, so that they are ready to go to a bank like Eastern for funding — and they can come to the bank with the endorsement of a trusted community partner.Eastern’s loan package “is not a solution for everybody, but it clearly clears the decks for some people who are almost there,” he said. Vidaña said he is not aware of other banks that are working on this kind of credit flexibility. “I applaud Eastern Bank for doing that because I think it's a long time coming,” he said. And he says “they have the right relationships with the other organizations and vice versa to essentially support the unique needs [of companies] that are going to be part of this process.”But he cautions that “the time frame for us to know whether this is an impactful approach is going to be a while.” One of the partner organizations in the new alliance is Mill Cities Community Investments, a Lawrence-based nonprofit lender that already offers loans specifically tailored to traditionally underserved communities. Executive Director Glynn Lloyd said it is important for commercial banks like Eastern to look for new ways to get capital to minoirty-owned business. “The credit system has discrimination built into it,” Lloyd said. “For a lot of Black and brown people, the credit scores reflect some institutional racism.”So Lloyd says he is excited about being part of Eastern’s new alliance “because this is an example of where you have a really untraditional bank trying to figure out how do we get debt products out to our folks that have been historically kind of shut out.”",Local,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 12:00:27 EST",1a62b2728b25f86828fd52192a5d4651

Eighteen groups filed 38 proposed laws and four proposed amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution by a Wednesday deadline, the first step in a long path toward putting their ideas before voters as ballot questions. Broadly, the topics range from education policy to legislative transparency to voting rights. Some specific proposals seek to formally establish the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples Day in Massachusetts, raise the minimum wage for tipped workers, suspend the state’s gas tax if fuel prices cross a certain threshold, and decriminalize natural psychedelic substances like psilocybin mushrooms. Attorney General Andrea Campbell plans to announce on Sept. 6 which proposals filed with her office are constitutionally valid. The backers of those petitions, if they’re seeking to place a potential law on the 2024 ballot, will then need to gather and file the signatures of more than 75,000 registered voters by Dec. 6. The groups proposing constitutional amendments, which need to be twice-approved by the Legislature, are working toward the 2026 ballot. Here’s a look at some of the issues that could wind up on the 2024 ballot. Massachusetts voters passed a statewide ban on rent control in 1994. As cities like Boston pursue a winding path through the Legislature to try to impose local rent-stabilization policies, one state lawmaker is hoping to take the concept to voters once again. Cambridge Democrat Rep. Mike Connolly, who said he was acting in his “personal capacity as a renter,” filed a petition that would lift the ban and revive rent control as an option for cities and towns that choose to adopt it.An industry-backed coalition that wants to ensure drivers for platforms like Uber and Lyft retain their status as independent contractors is back for round two. But this time, organized labor is in the mix with its own question. The Supreme Judicial Court struck from last year’s ballot a question that would have written into law that the drivers are contractors rather than employees, leaving unsettled a fight that’s been simmering for years on Beacon Hill about the drivers’ status, rights and benefits. This year, the coalition filed nine versions of their question, trying to find the right language to fend off a potential court challenge. Backers of the question say contractor status allows for the independence that many drivers prize, while opponents say it denies them the rights and benefits guaranteed to employees.The labor union 32BJ SEIU, meanwhile, put forward its own question that would allow the drivers to unionize, with the goal of being able to negotiate their working conditions.Another union with its sights on the 2024 ballot is the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which for years has been calling for changes to the state’s MCAS assessments. The MTA backs a question that would end the use of MCAS tests as a high school graduation requirement, and its board plans to decide at a Sunday meeting whether to launch a full union campaign in support of the initiative. A similar question was also filed by a Lexington mom. Critics of the MCAS say using the exam as a graduation requirement can be punitive, especially to students with special needs or those from marginalized groups. Supporters say it’s a crucial tool for ensuring uniform standards across districts and tracking whether students are getting the instruction they need. Petitioners filed eight different versions of a question that would require voters to show an ID at the polls. A similar proposal, which was backed by the Massachusetts Republican Party, failed to make last year’s ballot after its supporters didn’t gather enough signatures. Other election-related questions would expand voter registration options and create a non-partisan election system where the top five candidates of any party advance after a preliminary contest for state-level and Congressional elections. One of the constitutional amendments eyed for 2026 would restore voting rights to Massachusetts citizens incarcerated for felony offenses. That would effectively reverse an amendment voters approved in 2000 that prohibited people from voting while in prison serving felony sentences. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio and top lawmakers have for months been in a standoff over whether DiZoglio has the authority to audit the Legislature. House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka say it would violate the state Constitution, while DiZoglio maintains that an audit would boost transparency in a body she’s described as a “closed-door operation.”DiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat, last week requested AG Campbell’s support in bringing the matter to court, and now she’s backing that up with a ballot campaign as well. DiZoglio is one of the petitioners on an initiative that would expressly authorize her office to audit the Legislature.",Politics,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:27:31 EST",74b296a9bbcaef40521397d34133a464

The shindig in question was billed partly as a fundraiser for Boston City Council President Ed Flynn; partly as a birthday party for his father, former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn; and partly as the launch of a campaign called “Save Our City.” The campaign was seemingly aimed, in part, at galvanizing opposition to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s reelection in 2025. The elected officials scheduled to attend promptly distanced themselves from “Save Our City,” and Regan said no such campaign actually exists.Still, the abortive launch raises some questions that had been simmering below the surface in Boston political circles without much public discussion. If Wu does, in fact, seek a second term in two years, will she run unopposed or face an opponent? And if she does get a challenge, will it come from the right or the left? Adam Reilly is joined by Dumcius and Yawu Miller, the former senior editor of the Bay State Banner, for a very early look at how the 2025 campaign might unfold.What do you expect from Boston’s 2025 mayoral race?

(AP) — A winter storm dumped heavy, wet snow in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday, causing tens of thousands of power outages, widespread school closings, dangerous driving conditions and a plane to slide off a taxiway.The storm's path included parts of New England, upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Snow totals by the time it winds up Wednesday were expected to range from a few inches to a few feet, depending on the area.About two feet of snow fell in parts of northern New York and the Catskill Mountains, and Gov. Kathy Hochul said some areas could get an additional foot of snow by Wednesday morning. In New Hampshire, state police asked drivers to stay off the roads Tuesday afternoon due to whiteout conditions. State Police said they had dealt with more than 120 crashes.In Derry, New Hampshire, firefighters and police officers used chain saws, shovels and their bare hands to rescue a girl who was trapped under a fallen tree. Authorities said the girl had been playing outside near a parent who was clearing snow when the tree fell on her. The girl was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.All northbound lanes of Interstate 95 on the Piscataqua River Bridge between Maine and New Hampshire were shut down after two tractor trailer trucks became stuck on the bridge due to icy conditions.In the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, heavy, wet snow made driving treacherous, weighing down tree limbs and causing several spinouts. The storm dumped at least a foot of wintry mix in some areas.Further east in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where as much as 18 inches of snow was reported to have fallen, Jean Guerrer said the conditions were too dangerous for him to drive to work as a Boston-based taxi driver.Peter Davis, a semiretired commercial roofer, relished in the snowstorm, breaking out his new snow blower. But an hour into the snow removal, a piece of asphalt thrown onto the sidewalk by a snow plow got stuck in his new snow blower and broke a shear pin, forcing him to go repair the equipment.A Delta Air Lines plane veered off a paved surface as it taxied for takeoff from a Syracuse, New York, airport Tuesday morning. Flight 1718, which was bound for New York City’s LaGuardia Airport, slid into a grassy area north of the runway, forcing passengers off the plane and onto buses back to the terminal, according to airport officials. No one was injured and the airport remained open.“During a departure taxi-out this morning, the nose gear of a Delta aircraft exited the paved surface of a taxiway,” Delta said in a statement. “This was not an airplane skidding off a runway.”Delta said the plane carried 58 customers and a flight crew of five.More than 400 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Tuesday, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.The National Weather Service said that in New York, 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour or more was falling in higher elevations in the eastern Catskills through the mid-Hudson Valley, central Taconics and Berkshires. Wet, heavy snow snapped tree branches and downed power lines across New York’s capital region with power outages hitting homes and businesses in the Albany area.Dustin Reidy, a county legislator who lives in Albany, said he stocked up on groceries and prepared an emergency bin of candles, flashlights, and extra batteries ahead of the storm.“I don’t think the storm is as bad in my neck of the woods, but I give a lot of credit to the snow plows,” said Reidy, who was working from home. He said snow plows crews were outside since early morning to ensure roads were clear.The snowfall totals will be among the highest of the season, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the weather service office in College Park, Maryland.“It has been below average for snowfall across the Northeast this year, and so this nor'easter will be very impactful,"" he said.While higher elevations get snow, authorities warned residents in coastal areas to watch for possible flooding because of heavy rains. The National Weather Service in New York said wind gusts could reach 50 mph across Long Island and lower Connecticut.Rain was turning into snow across parts of New England with winds picking up and power outages reported across the region. In New Hampshire, it was Election Day for town officeholders, but more than 70 communities postponed voting because of the storm.In Kingston, New Hampshire, police offered voters rides to the polls. In Weare, power was knocked out at the polling place, forcing officials to set up battery-powered lights until a generator could be brought in. Interstate 93, the state’s main north-south route, was shut down in Londonderry in both directions around 12:30 p.m. after electrical wires came down across the highway.In Connecticut, state government offices and courts were closed Tuesday. State offices were also closed in New York.The weather service said expected snow totals from the storm, which is forecast to wind up Wednesday, range from more than 2 feet in higher elevations in New York, New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, to 4 to 6 inches in Boston.SeparatorMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

""The good news is as a result of Irene, we were able to mitigate some of the infrastructure, so we hopefully won't repeat in those areas that were affected before,"" he said. ""We've been able to upgrade and armor some of those areas so that we don't have a repeat."" Vermont authorities knew at least 48 hours in advance they would not have enough resources ahead of the storm, and has deployed state water rescue teams, as well as those from North Carolina and Massachusetts. Michigan and Connecticut have also supplied mutual aid, Vermont's Urban Search and Rescue Program Coordinator Mike Cannon said Monday. So far, 19 people have been rescued by boat and 25 have been evacuated, Cannon said. Ludlow, Vt.'s town manager, Brendan McNamara, said the rivers began flowing over their banks at about 2:45 a.m. on Monday, and that there is catastrophic damage to Okemo, a southern Vermont resort town. ""The total scope of what kind of damage that has occurred in Ludlow – the onion isn't even peeled back at all right now,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm up and down Main Street because that's what we can access and it is not good.""Neighborhoods in Vermont towns including Londonderry and Weston are currently completely inaccessible, and rescue teams are trying to gain access to continue welfare checks, Cannon said. Additionally, teams are in the process of rescuing employees and campers from a state park in Plymouth, Vt. Scott said the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has offered their full support. More flooding could be on the wayA flash flood warning is in effect in parts of central and southern Vermont until 11:15 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. An extra half inch to 1.5 inches of rainfall are possible by Monday evening, and flooding is imminent in low-lying areas, such as rivers, streams and creeks, the agency said. Flood safety tips Don't drive through flood water. Evacuate or move to higher ground if water levels are rising.Pay attention to local media alerts.Don't operate generators inside and make sure they are property ventilated once outside.Shut the circuit breaker off before evacuating to make it easier for rescue teams to do their work.

6330,Shortage of perinatal healthcare workers hurting underrepresented communities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2023/07/12/shortage-of-perinatal-healthcare-workers-hurting-underrepresented-communities,The Moms Matter Act would help expand post-pregnancy care.,"It’s widely accepted that the U.S. is experiencing a mental health crisis. Often overlooked, even in the midst of the crisis, is perinatal mental health. Perinatal refers to the period of time from pregnancy up until one year after birth. Mood and anxiety disorders during that time affect at least 20% of mothers but are often left undiagnosed, forcing new parents to navigate those difficulties alone. People of color and low-income mothers are even more likely to struggle with these issues but less likely to receive the care they need.But there’s movement on the matter: A new bill called the Moms Matter Act, that aims to expand and diversify the state’s perinatal workforce, is making its way through the Massachusetts Legislature. One of its fiercest advocates is Dr. Rose Molina, an OB-GYN and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Molina joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the importance of helping new mothers, especially those from underrepresented communities, get the help they need. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: First off, as an OB-GYN, you encounter this population every day. When did you realize that the system, as it stands now, is not doing the job?Dr. Rose Molina: I encounter this issue every day that I’m in clinic. I think that mental health challenges really have a disproportionate effect—particularly on communities of color, low-income communities, and immigrant communities—and there is so much strength and resilience in people having the courage to speak out about the help that they need and the issues that they’re struggling with. Yet what’s really challenging for me as an OB-GYN is to get people the mental health support that they need in a timely manner. Waitlists are long, and there are few behavioral health clinicians that come from the same communities as patients who speak their language, who understand life in their shoes, and who can really develop that trusting kind of therapeutic relationship that we know is so important for better mental health outcomes. And so, for that reason, I wholeheartedly support the Moms Matter Act, and I hope that it is moved favorably out of the [Legislative] committee. Rath: You spoke to the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery, and something that was interesting that you talked about was how, in terms of tackling this problem, it’s not just about expanding the workforce but diversifying it. Could you expand on that?Dr. Molina: That is a really important part of this bill. And yes, we do have a workforce shortage. We certainly need to expand capacity. We need more behavioral health clinicians across the board—that’s certainly true. But, as I mentioned, particularly for the patients that I see who are often people who identify from marginalized communities, whether they’re Black or Brown or recently-arrived folks, they really want to see people who look like them, who have shared lived experience, who they can communicate with in the same language, especially as they’re sharing some of the most deeply private parts of their lives. And we know that mental health, sadly, remains very stigmatized in many communities, and so being able to talk about what people are struggling with, whether it’s depression, anxiety, suicidal thought, thoughts about harming their baby, for example—things that are very stigmatized in our society. It’s hard for people to do that when they don’t feel comfortable with the behavioral health clinicians they see. So diversifying the behavioral health clinician workforce is critical.One of my great privileges is, because I speak Spanish, most of the patients that I see speak Spanish, and I know that many of them sort of breathe a sigh of relief when they see that they can communicate directly with me without an interpreter. I can only imagine how important that sensation is when they’re talking about something as private as their mental health issues. And oftentimes related to mental health issues are other socially stigmatizing conditions, like struggling with food insecurity, struggling with finding housing, struggling with intimate partner violence, a lot of issues that are deeply private and are hard to talk about with anybody, let alone someone who might not share the same background or be able to communicate directly in the same language. Rath: Over the last few years, especially since the pandemic, we’ve talked a lot on this program about community health centers and their importance in serving communities that we’re talking about here—that are underserved. Is there a role for community health centers in getting out this perinatal care to these communities that need it?Dr. Molina: Absolutely. Really, community health centers are the backbone of the health system, and we reach the most marginalized communities in a welcome, inclusive and geographically accessible way. Health centers are super important, and I think are the backbone and need to be at the forefront of expanding mental health for pregnant individuals. Rath: So, with this moment of attention, then, how would you like to see things expand? What would be ideal for you to see in Massachusetts as we go forward?Dr. Molina: One of the things that the Moms Matter Act would do is provide more funding to community-based organizations that do a lot of the frontline support in helping birthing people welcome new babies into their lives. So I think that we need to build more connections between community-based organizations and the healthcare system, particularly in this space of mental health. So thinking about who mental health workers are—whether they are social workers, licensed mental health counselors, peer specialists—all of those folks need training and need support in their professional development to be able to continue to reach people where they need. So I think really thinking broadly about who the behavioral health workforce is—not only thinking about the people who sit within clinics but also the people who live and work in communities and how we can provide the best training for those individuals to also provide mental health support and counseling for the individuals who need it to really meet people where they’re at.Rath: And finally, you mentioned earlier some of the warning signs to look out for. For anybody who’s listening who is in this part of their life, if you’re not really up on the latest in mental health, what are warning signs to look out for, and what should people do to get help? Dr. Molina: The most common mental health conditions we see in the pregnancy period are depression and anxiety. These are both mood disorders and any sort of symptoms around feeling down, sad, depressed, lack of energy, having problems with sleep, changes in appetite, feeling more irritable; all of these things can be symptoms of depression, particularly in the postpartum period.It’s important for new moms to think about their well-being in the context of the first few weeks. That can be challenging because in the first few weeks, we know most people are not sleeping. Their eating might also be a little bit erratic as they’re taking care of a newborn, especially if they start to have thoughts of harming themselves or harming other people, including their babies. So we certainly encourage anyone who thinks those symptoms apply to them to reach out—whether it’s their midwife, OB-GYN, or whoever they see for pregnancy care—to reach out and have a conversation about those symptoms.And for anyone who is in need of urgent mental health support, they can always call 1-800-981-4357. There’s also a statewide behavioral health helpline for anyone in Massachusetts, and the number for that is 1-833-773-2445.",National,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 18:32:38 EST",3f78c8e13eddc2850e2f60f550f3e3f3
6813,19-year-olds can now apply to be Essex County correctional officers,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/28/19-year-olds-can-now-apply-to-be-essex-county-correctional-officers,The sheriff said it’s been a struggle to maintain staffing levels at the second-largest jail in Massachusetts.,"The Essex County Sheriff’s Office on Monday lowered the age requirement for correctional officers from 21 to 19 years old.Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger said it’s been a struggle to maintain staffing levels at the second-largest jail in Massachusetts, in part because of increasing anti–law enforcement sentiments. The county previously added a $2,500 hiring bonus to attract workers. Now, Coppinger is hoping the lower age requirement — combined with the state's tuition remission program — will appeal to more applicants.Essex is not the only Massachusetts county to employ 19-year-old correctional officers. Still, some people criticized the decision.“Some people will argue they might not be mature enough, but we're going to do extensive background checks to all our board interviews, we have our own academy so we can make sure we're training them properly,” Coppinger said.“There's some immature 19-year-olds out there, but I run into immature 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, 40-year-olds, all the way up the gamut,” he added. “So it's a look at the individual, not just the particular group, and let the individual make their case to convince us that we should take a chance on them and they take a chance on us.”Coppinger added that the sheriff’s office has employed 19-year-olds in the past, and other counties also hire with a lower age requirement. Other counties in Massachusetts with a minimum hiring age of 19 for their correctional officers include Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Franklin and Hampshire counties, according to their position listings. The minimum age in Bristol County has been 19 since at least 1998, a spokesperson for the office said.In addition to concerns of maturity, some critics urge officials to look at further reforms. Liz Matos, the executive director of the Prisoners' Legal Services of Massachusetts, said instead of figuring out ways to attract more correctional officers, the state should implement reforms to decrease the overall number of people incarcerated.“Some states and counties allow 19-year-olds to work as corrections officers,” Matos said in an email statement. “However, instead of lowering the age for hiring, steps like eliminating cash bail could be taken to reduce the need for additional hiring.” About 65% of Essex County’s incarcerated people were being held in pre-trial detention, according to January’s state data.Some Massachusetts county sheriff offices still require a 21-year-old minimum to be a correctional officer, including Barnstable, Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties.Hampden County has allowed younger candidates into the training academy, but it is rare, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office said in an email statement.“While the Hampden County Sheriff's Office has always required correctional officers to be at least 21 years of age, in very rare instances, we have allowed someone younger than 21 to enter one of our correctional officer academies,” the statement said. “That has only happened as long as the recruit was at least 19 years of age, in accordance with Commonwealth of Massachusetts regulations.”The state Department of Corrections also requires candidates to be 21 years of age to be appointed as a correctional officer, but the entrance exam can be taken at 19, according to state law.Coppinger recognizes that even with the lowered age limit, the job won’t appeal to everyone. One of his sons, for example, appreciates the ability to work remotely for his job. That’s not an option for correctional officers.But for those who are looking for a “starting place to get in law enforcement,” Coppinger thinks the job might align well with what many young adults are looking for.“It can be rewarding. It can be frustrating. I'm not going to sugarcoat it,” he said. “But $68,000 annual salary starting in, all the overtime you want, the tuition program, it's got nice benefits working for the state of Massachusetts. It's just what people want.”",Local,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:17:51 EST",17586fc2623c83987f61b984e4dc1486
102,Mass. guardsman arrested in leak of classified military documents,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/13/ap-sources-fbi-wants-to-speak-with-mass-guardsman-in-leaks-probe,The Biden administration has scrambled for days to contain the fallout from the leaked information.,"Updated April 13 at 6:16 p.m.WASHINGTON (AP) — A Massachusetts Air National Guard member was arrested Thursday in connection with the disclosure of highly classified military documents about the Ukraine war and other top national security issues, an alarming breach that has raised fresh questions about America's ability to safeguard its most sensitive secrets.The guardsman, an IT specialist identified as 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, was taken into custody without incident after FBI officers converged on his Massachusetts home. He is to be charged under a provision of the Espionage Act that makes it a crime to remove or transmit classified national defense information, Attorney General Merrick Garland said.Garland did not reveal a possible motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat room where the documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by bravado than ideology.While Thursday's arrest was a pivotal moment in an investigation into the highest-profile intelligence leak in years, the military and Justice Department were still scrutinizing how sensitive government secrets shared in a chat room ended up circulating around the world. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect is bound to raise questions about how such a profound breach, one that the Pentagon termed a “very serious risk to national security,” could have been caused by such a young, low-ranking service member.“We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman. He referred all questions about the investigation to the Justice Department.Teixeira was a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs.In that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks, a defense official told the Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.Hours after the arrest, Rep. Mike Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement pledging to “examine why this happened, why it went unnoticed for weeks, and how to prevent future leaks.”Teixeira, who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts at the time heavily armed tactical agents took him into custody, is due to have his initial court appearance in Massachusetts on Friday. It was not immediately clear if Teixeira had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf, and a phone message left at a number believed to belong to his mother was not immediately returned.Some local veterans have reacted with shock and dismay at the involvement of a local airman. Donald Ellis, an Air Force veteran of the Korean War who lives in Sagamore Village, told CAI that leaks like this put service members’ safety at risk.“All of the people that we have serving around the world that are either in National Guard units, regular units, or that served — men, women — they just now become a real serious target,” Ellis said.U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Marine veteran who represents Massachusetts in Congress, told GBH News he wants answers on how this happened.""The Pentagon is going to need to explain how a junior enlisted National Air Guardsman has access to Ukranian war plans being briefed to the joint chiefs of staff at top secret level,"" Auchincloss said.The Biden administration has scrambled to contain the potential diplomatic and military fallout from the leaks since they were first reported last week, moving to assure allies and assess the scope of damage. Pentagon officials have expressed alarm about the disclosures, but President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Ireland earlier Thursday, said “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.”The classified documents — which have not been individually authenticated by U.S. officials — range from briefing slides mapping out Ukrainian military positions to assessments of international support for Ukraine and other sensitive topics, including under what circumstances Russian President Vladimir Putin might use nuclear weapons.There’s no clear answer on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.The leak is believed to have started on a site called Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games and where Teixeira is believed to have posted for years about guns, games and his favorite memes — and, according to some chatting with him, closely guarded U.S. secrets.The investigative website Bellingcat and The New York Times first publicly identified Teixeira, minutes before federal officials confirmed he was a subject of interest in the investigation. They reported tracking profiles on other more obscure sites linked to Teixeira.In previous Associated Press stories, the leaker was identified as “the O.G.” by a member of the online chat group where Teixeira and others have posted for years. The member of the chat group declined to give his name to the AP, citing concerns for his personal safety.The chat group, called “Thug Shaker Central,” drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite types of guns and also shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also included a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In that discussion, “the O.G.” would for months post material that he said was classified — originally typing it out with his own notations, then a few months ago switching to posting images of folded-up papers because he felt his writings weren’t being taken seriously, the person said.Discord has said it was cooperating with law enforcement.There are only a few ways the classified information that was leaked could have been accessed. Typically in classified briefings with slides like those that were placed on Discord, the information is shared electronically. That can be done either through secure computer terminals where users gain access based on their credentials or through tablets that are distributed for briefings and collected later. If the slides need to be printed out instead, they can only be sent to secured printers that are able to handle classified documents — and that keep a digital record of everyone who has requested a printout.For those with a security clearance, their handling of classified material is based largely on training and trust that they will safeguard the information.“When you join the military, depending on your position, you may require a security clearance,” Ryder said. “And if you are working in the intelligence community, and you require a security clearance, you’re going to go through the proper vetting.”Ryder said each service member who obtains a clearance signs a non-disclosure agreement and is trained on the military’s strict guidelines for handling classified material. The leaks were “a deliberate criminal act, a violation of those guidelines.”SeparatorAssociated Press writers Michelle R.

6508,Mel King dies at 94,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/mel-king-dies-at-94,King was a longtime community advocate and Boston’s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election.,"Updated March 28 at 10:21 p.m.Melvin King, a longtime community advocate, state legislator, and Boston’s first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election, has died at age 94.His son Michael King confirmed Mel King’s death to GBH News Tuesday evening.“He spoke truth to power, and he was pretty much beyond — above — reproach,” Michael King said. “That’s the openness and the example that he was trying to set. ‘It’s not that hard to do the right thing,’ is something that he would say.”For the past half-century, King has been one of the city’s most well-known advocates for local communities of color. In politics, his endorsement was highly sought after by candidates seeking credibility with Boston’s Black community.King was born in Boston’s South End neighborhood, which in the mid-20th century represented the heart of the city’s Black population. He graduated from what is now the John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, then-Boston Tech. King was first elected to public office in 1973 to the state Legislature representing Suffolk County. He lost to Ray Flynn in the 1983 mayoral election. That run in 1983 would end up inspiring people like Tito Jackson, who ran for the office in 2017. He said he remembers being 8 years old, seeing a large Black man — in every sense of that word — speaking the truth. He said the Mel King way of organizing a coalition, across race and income, informed his own run. “As sad of a moment as this is, it also means that Mel King lived an impactful life that touched the lives of tens of thousands — and maybe hundreds of thousands — of people,” Jackson said. State Sen. Lydia Edwards, a frequent visitor to King’s Sunday brunches, said his passing marks the end of the city’s radically loving activists.“I’m really sad because we don’t have any more Mels, not even a pipeline for Mels at all,” she said. “He was a universal uniter, above the geographic division, above class division, race — he was the one all organizers could look to and know his heart was the purest.”King endorsed Edwards during her first, unsuccessful run for state Senate in 2016.For Boston City Councilor Kendra Lara, King guided her political organizing from a young age. As a state Representative, he helped the People Before Highways movement, a movement that put a stop to government attempts to extend the I-95 through Roxbury. Residents’ fierce pushback put 2,000 protesters on the street in 1969, which halted the development and ultimately led to the Orange Line being brought into those neighborhoods instead. “When I learned that story — when I was in the sixth grade — is when I realized that people who looked like me and the people in my neighborhood had power. That if we could stop a 10-lane highway from cutting through our neighborhood, that there was absolutely nothing that we couldn’t do,” said Lara, who now represents Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury. “And Mel King is a part of that legacy.“When I think about my community, it exists in the way it does because of him,” she continued. “And when I think about my generation of organizers — and when I think about the generation of Black and brown young people who grew up in movements, who grew up fighting to make sure that their community had a voice and power in what our neighborhoods looked like — it is because people like Mel King set the standard.”“For decades, Mel King taught us all how to serve, how to build, and how to love,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement Tuesday night. “On behalf of the City of Boston, we send our deepest condolences to the King family and the many, many loved ones, mentees, and friends of Mel. With gratitude and determination to keep fighting, Rest in Power.”“Mel King is an iconic figure for Boston, not just in the Black community, but Boston overall because he knew how to bring people together,” said Bishop William E. Dickerson II, a friend of King’s. “I know that his impact is going to be missed deeply by so many people, so many sectors, of our communities.” Michael King, one of King’s six children, is the director of the South End Technology Center, which the elder King founded in 1997. He says his father was part of the solution that helped pave the way to make Boston's leadership more diverse.“You know, he was part of the solution to get us to be able to accept that any person who has done their homework and does their homework can reach any point in life,” he said. King said he wanted to honor his father and rejoice in his life.“I don’t think there’s anything to be sad about. We miss him, but that’s the selfish part of us, you know?” said Michael King. “I feel like I was blessed to be, you know — have a chance to, you know — be in this time, next to someone who took his journey so seriously.” This story has been updated to include additional comments and information.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 20:56:40 EST",abd0cad63eee6071b83fb12fbd183666

2664,Vermont’s new cartoonist laureate talks the wonder of comics,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/12/vermonts-new-cartoonist-laureate-talks-the-wonder-of-comics,Tillie Walden will become the youngest cartoonist laureate for the Green Mountain state.,"The highest education Tillie Walden achieved is a “certificate of cartooning.” But on April 13, she can add cartoonist laureate to her resume. Walden, 26, will become Vermont’s fifth and youngest cartoonist laureate at a statehouse ceremony in Montpelier. She takes over the role from 71-year-old Rick Veitch. This cartoonist laureate position is unique to the state, which prides itself in welcoming quirky counterculture. Walden said the role is a way of acknowledging an artform that is “a lost little sister” to other mainstream art. “It’s so special for me that the state that I live in has decided to care about what I do,” Walden said on Boston Public Radio on Wednesday. Walden began drawing cartoons after her father signed her up for a class with Scott McCloud. Her first comic was about a boy turning into an octopus (“It was terrible,” she recalled). But McCloud saw potential and told her so. His encouragement changed the course of Walden’s life. Rather than going to college, she enrolled at the Center for Cartoon Studies in White River Junction, Vermont. In 2018, Walden received the Eisner Award for her graphic novel ""Spinning,"" a coming-of-age tale of becoming a competitive ice skater. And in 2021, she joined the faculty at the Center for Cartoon Studies.In recent years, cartoons and graphic novels have emerged out of the nerdsphere and into the mainstream, even being added to literary curriculum. Along with respect, cartoonists are getting more money for their work, Walden said. She is currently working on a graphic novel trilogy called ""Clementine"" that follows a character from “The Walking Dead” universe, and she is illustrating a book for the pop duo Tegan and Sara. Walden is also a member of a growing group of queer cartoonists. ""Spinning"" is a memoir that chronicles her own experience as a lesbian competitive figure skater, and many of Walden’s other stories feature queer protagonists. “It’s amazing to talk about what queerness/gayness looks like in all these different facets of narrative,” said Walden. From ice skating to sci-fi, “queer stories of all kinds are being accepted.”At the same time, graphic novels, including ""Spinning,"" are being banned in some school districts. Walden said it’s surreal to have people read a book about her life and deem it inappropriate content. Partly in response to these book bans, Walden’s full color, sci-fi graphic novel ""On a Sunbeam"" is available online for free. During her three-year tenure as cartoonist laureate, Walden hopes to bring cartooning to communities across Vermont. This first year she will hop in her Subaru and visit senior centers, queer book clubs, comic book shops and schools to talk about what comics are and what they mean to Vermonters. “My goal in my tenure is to spread the word that comics are accessible, that comics are wonderful to read, to make, to think about — at any age or any ability,” she said.",Local,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 18:16:23 EST",8ce236352229210a48eec724c82ebcbd

231,Housing nonprofit breaks ground on facility for middle-income seniors,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/06/housing-nonprofit-breaks-ground-on-facility-for-middle-income-seniors,The development hopes to tackle a lack of options for middle-income seniors.,"A groundbreaking ceremony Monday kicked off construction at Opus Newton, a middle-income senior living development touted by housing developer 2Life Communities as the first of its kind in the nation. The housing nonprofit offers government-subsidized options for seniors, and the state is full of luxury housing for those in the upper end of the income bracket, said 2Life President and CEO Amy Schectman. But when it comes to the middle, a majority of older adults are left with few options. “They can't afford the high-end stuff and they don't qualify for the lower-end stuff because they earn a little bit too much money or saved a little bit too much money,” Schectman said. “There's a moral imperative to close that market gap and to provide something that offers a chance for the people in the middle.”The nonprofit spent the last seven years trying to figure out how to address the needs of this specific demographic, Schectman says. To keep monthly fees low, residents pay a one-time “community share” fee for their unit, funding that helps pay for the construction period. By providing at-home care on site, residents can opt in or out of services depending on need, which reduces costs for the nonprofit. Meals will be served three times per week, instead of nightly, and residents sign a contract to volunteer at least 10 hours of their time per month to help out with the needs of the community. “People are coming up with more and more really interesting topics that they're going to lead, groups they're going to be part of,” Schectman said. Volunteer hours can be used creatively, and some future residents have already suggested a jazz group, a choir, lecture series and question and answer sessions with nurses. “Lots of vibrant activity is already coming from our residents.” Units at Opus begin at $380,000 to buy and $1,800 monthly to rent, according to Schectman. Opus leverages residents’ home equity and offers the option to receive 80% of their up-front “community share” payment when they leave, or use the funds for their care.Of the 174 available units, 95% have already been sold, according to a 2Life spokesperson, which enabled the nonprofit to begin construction a full year ahead of schedule. MassDevelopment, the state's finance and development agency, is supporting the project with $130 million in tax-exempt bond financing. The new housing development is slated to open in the summer of 2025, connected to the Coleman House operated by 2Life (formerly Jewish Housing for the Elderly) on the Jewish Community Center of Greater Boston’s Campus. “Massachusetts faces a housing crisis, and projects like Opus Newton … bring us an important step forward in easing the housing burden for Greater Boston and for Massachusetts,” MassDevelopment President and CEO Dan Rivera said in a statement. State and city leaders including Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Massachusetts) and Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller were on hand for the groundbreaking Monday.“We know so many individuals in our lives are making choices about where to live based on the high cost of housing,” said Driscoll. “Let’s make those choices easier. Let’s allow people to live and grow and age with dignity in the communities they love. This is a thrilling day for Newton. Let’s make sure we can have more thrilling days across this commonwealth.""Single older people in Massachusetts are more likely to face economic insecurity than their peers in any other state — despite higher average incomes than elderly people in many other parts of the country, according to a UMass Boston study from 2019. Last month, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced 800 new affordable housing units throughout the city, including 160 income-restricted units for seniors.",Local,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 16:41:47 EST",c982c8696245f8f1ef1417def5ec39f5

Regulators had worked all weekend to try to find a buyer for the bank, which was the second-largest bank failure in history. Those efforts appeared to have failed Sunday.In a sign of how fast the financial bleeding was occurring, regulators announced that New York-based Signature Bank had also failed and was being seized on Sunday. At more than $110 billion in assets, Signature Bank is the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.The near-financial crisis that U.S. regulators had to intervene to prevent left Asian markets jittery as trading began Monday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 1.6% in morning trading, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4%. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite increased 0.3%.In an effort to shore up confidence in the banking system, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC said Sunday that all Silicon Valley Bank clients would be protected and able to access their money. They also announced steps that are intended to protect the bank's customers and prevent additional bank runs.""This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth,"" the agencies said in a joint statement.Under the plan, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including those whose holdings exceed the $250,000 insurance limit, will be able to access their money on Monday.Also Sunday, another beleaguered bank, First Republic Bank, announced that it had bolstered its financial health by gaining access to funding from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase.In a separate announcement, the Fed late Sunday announced an expansive emergency lending program that's intended to prevent a wave of bank runs that would threaten the stability of the banking system and the economy as a whole. Fed officials characterized the program as akin to what central banks have done for decades: Lend freely to the banking system so that customers would be confident that they could access their accounts whenever needed.The lending facility will allow banks that need to raise cash to pay depositors to borrow that money from the Fed, rather than having to sell Treasuries and other securities to raise the money. Silicon Valley Bank had been forced to dump some of its Treasuries at at a loss to fund its customers' withdrawals. Under the Fed's new program, banks can post those securities as collateral and borrow from the emergency facility.The Treasury has set aside $25 billion to offset any losses incurred under the Fed's emergency lending facility. Fed officials said, however, that they do not expect to have to use any of that money, given that the securities posted as collateral have a very low risk of default.Analysts said the Fed's program should be enough to calm financial markets on Monday.""Monday will surely be a stressful day for many in the regional banking sector, but today's action dramatically reduces the risk of further contagion,"" economists at Jefferies, an investment bank, said in a research note.Though Sunday's steps marked the most extensive government intervention in the banking system since the 2008 financial crisis, its actions are relatively limited compared with what was done 15 years ago. The two failed banks themselves have not been rescued, and taxpayer money has not been provided to the banks.President Joe Biden said Sunday evening as he boarded Air Force One back to Washington that he would speak about the bank situation on Monday. In a statement, Biden also said he was ""firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess fully accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.""Regulators had to rush to close Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution with more than $200 billion in assets, on Friday when it experienced a traditional run on the bank where depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once. It is the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind only the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual.Some prominent Silicon Valley executives feared that if Washington didn't rescue the failed bank, customers would make runs on other financial institutions in the coming days. Stock prices plunged over the last few days at other banks that cater to technology companies, including First Republic Bank and PacWest Bank.Among the bank's customers are a range of companies from California's wine industry, where many wineries rely on Silicon Valley Bank for loans, and technology startups devoted to combating climate change. Sunrun, which sells and leases solar energy systems, had less than $80 million of cash deposits with Silicon Valley. Stitchfix, the clothing retail website, disclosed recently that it had a credit line of up to $100 million with Silicon Valley Bank and other lenders.Tiffany Dufu, founder and CEO of The Cru, a New York-based career coaching platform and community for women, posted a video Sunday on LinkedIn from an airport bathroom, saying the bank crisis was testing her resiliency. Given that her money was tied up at Silicon Valley Bank, she had to pay her employees out of her personal bank account. With two teenagers to support who will be heading to college, she said she was relieved to hear that the government's intent is to make depositors whole.""Small businesses and early-stage startups don't have a lot of access to leverage in a situation like this, and we're often in a very vulnerable position, particularly when we have to fight so hard to get the wires into your bank account to begin with, particularly for me, as a Black female founder,"" Dufu told The Associated Press.Silicon Valley Bank began its slide into insolvency when its customers, largely technology companies that needed cash as they struggled to get financing, started withdrawing their deposits. The bank had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals, leading to the largest failure of a U.S. financial institution since the height of the financial crisis.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointed to rising interest rates, which have been increased by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, as the core problem for Silicon Valley Bank. Many of its assets, such as bonds or mortgage-backed securities, lost market value as rates climbed.Sheila Bair, who was chairwoman of the FDIC during the 2008 financial crisis, recalled that with nearly all the bank failures then, ""we sold a failed bank to a healthy bank. And usually, the healthy acquirer would also cover the uninsured because they wanted the franchise value of those large depositors so optimally, that's the best outcome.""But with Silicon Valley Bank, she told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""this was a liquidity failure, it was a bank run, so they didn't have time to prepare to market the bank. So they're having to do that now, and playing catch-up.""___Rugaber and Megerian reported from Washington.

7449,The happiest country in the world wants to fly you in for a free masterclass,https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2023/03/24/the-happiest-country-in-the-world-wants-to-fly-you-in-for-a-free-masterclass,"Finland, which has held the title of happiest country for six years running, is now looking to teach the rest of the world a thing or two.","Finland, which has held the title of happiest country for six years running, is now looking to teach the rest of the world a thing or two. The Nordic country is hosting a four-day happiness masterclass in June, and its tourism board says 10 lucky applicants will get to go for free. Others will be able to study (and hopefully cheer) up virtually when it later becomes available online.""A question we often get is: 'How are you so happy?'"" Heli Jimenez, senior director of international marketing at Business Finland, said in a statement. ""We believe Finnish happiness stems from a close relationship with nature and our down-to-earth lifestyle: it's not some mystical state, but a skill that can be learned and shared."" Finland is marketing itself as uniquely positioned to take on the challenge, having just clinched the top spot in the World Happiness Report yet again (the U.S., in contrast, is ranked 15th).Happiness and well-being can be measured in many ways, including through people's own reported satisfaction with their lives, as researchers note. The World Happiness Report focuses on six factors to help explain it: social support, income, health, freedom, generosity and absence of corruption.Finnish tourism authorities have a few ideas for why people there are consistently so content, including low levels of crime and corruption, efficient public services and access to nature. Now they want to ""help people find and master that Finnish state of mind"" — saunas and pine forests included. ""We've chosen the best coaches, one of the most breath-taking resorts in Finland, and a time in the early summer amid the beautiful Finnish nature for our masterclass,"" Jimenez says. ""We feel it's a really unique opportunity to discover something wonderful and valuable: anyone curious should definitely apply."" What the class entailsThe happiness crash course will be divided up into four main themes — food and well-being, health and balance, design, and nature and lifestyle — and taught by four coaches who are experts in various fields. Officials say a more detailed program is on the way. It's slated to run from June 12-15, with participants arriving the day before and departing the day after. They'll stay at the Kuru Resort, a luxury resort in the Finnish Lakeland region that organizers describe as ""surrounded by fragrant pine forests and breath-taking views."" Each participant will get their own villa with panoramic windows, as well as a private sauna and spa. Because the program emphasizes good sleep and a digital detox, organizers say, the villas have no TVs (though in-room WiFi will be available) and even the bedding has been approved by sleep specialists.""Every minute detail [at] the resort is designed to help you wind down and relax — fragrances, sounds and materials included,"" they add. Participants' travel and accommodation expenses will be covered. But they have to hold up their end of the deal: They'll be filmed throughout their visit, with that material to be used in Visit Finland's communications and advertising. How to apply Officials say anyone over the age of 18 can apply for the masterclass, either individually or with a friend, relative or partner. They're looking for people who speak English, aren't representing brands or companies and are comfortable being filmed. ""We are looking for outgoing people who are interested in comprehensive wellbeing and Finnish nature,"" they say. ""You don't have to be a self-help enthusiast or have survival skills in Finnish nature. All we want is an open mind.""To apply, people must fill out an online form and complete a social media challenge on either Instagram or TikTok. The challenge: Create content, preferably a video, showing ""what things make you believe you may be secretly a Finn,"" and explaining why you want to take the masterclass.""Are you the type of person who would much rather go to a forest than to a party? One who feels absolute desperation when running out of coffee? Prefers washing up in a lake rather than in the shower? That's just your inner Finn,"" Visit Finland said in an Instagram post announcing the challenge. Applications will close on April 2, and winners will be publicly announced — on social media, of course — a month later.

4961,"Hey Bay Staters, it's time to talk bear safety",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/05/hey-bay-staters-its-time-to-talk-bear-safety,The  growing bear population in Massachusetts means their hunt for food includes backyard fixtures like chicken coops and bird feeders.,"In the 1970s there were fewer than 100 bears in the entire state of Massachusetts. Today, there are four to five thousand of them. Talk about inflation.For decades, nearly all of the growth in the bear population took place in the western part of the state. Not anymore.“Bears are now expanding, have expanded, through central Massachusetts,” said Dave Wattles, Black Bear & Furbearer Project leader for MassWildlife. “The population now in Worcester County is increasing very rapidly.”As that bear population pushes ever east, they are acclimating to more suburban and urban habitats, and coming into contact with more people. According to MassBears, a collaborative research effort of MassWildlife, the Massachusetts Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Amherst College, and University of Massachusetts Amherst — bears have been seen in recent years in places like Lowell, Middleborough, and Waltham to name just a few.“A conversation I have very regularly with people is like, ‘I've lived here my entire life. I grew up here. I've never seen a bear in town,’” said Wattles. “Well, because there weren't bears in your town 50 years ago, but now there are.”Just ask Harvard resident Gillian Kruskall.“[I was] coming downstairs at probably about 6:30 in the morning. And I actually — just out of the corner of my eye, out the side window — saw movement and just looked over and realized there's a giant bear in the tree,” she said of an encounter she had in June 2022. “We've seen bears in the area before, but this was the first time openly in the yard, just hanging out and enjoying a nice snack.”It is more than just snack time right now for bears in Massachusetts, who are now emerging from their long winter naps.“Bears are driven to find food,"" said Wattles. “They haven't eaten anything for four to five months. So, they are extremely hungry. And for the next seven to eight months, they need to eat all the food, getting all the calories they need to survive that period when they're not going to be eating next winter.”In early spring, nature’s best offering is something called skunk cabbage, which Wattles says is about as good as it sounds. But as more bears take up residency in more densely populated areas, they are increasingly finding more attractive alternatives in the human backyard.“[If I’m a bear] I can go to the wetlands and get some skunk cabbage, or I can go to a backyard and get a thousand calories in one sitting, said Wattles. “It’s not an immediate public safety threat, but the big challenge we have is trying to get people to learn what they need to do around their home to coexist with bears.”Here are Wattles' chief recommendationsBye-Bye, bird feederSorry, ornithophiles. Wattle’s number one tip is to take down those bird feeders. A large, cylindrical bird feeder filled with typical bird seed can pack thousands of calories, the equivalent of multiple large pizzas.“There's no such thing as a bird feeder,"" said Wattles. “A bird feeder is a wildlife feeder. You can't control what animal is coming to that feeder. And quite often when a bear empties one, someone will fill it back up the next day.”Protect the birds (and the bees) Wattles urges chicken owners to keep their coops inside electric fencing. And the same goes for beehives. He directs people to their website, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to make electric fencing more effective . “Conflict with chickens has become the number one source of serious conflict with bears,” said Wattles. “As bears are being trained to come to backyards by bird feeders and other food sources, they're encountering chicken coops and they're learning that, oh, chickens, feed, eggs, they're all a great, easy meal.”Grill baby, grill (and then clean it)Bears can smell that backyard barbeque long after the feast is over. “Bears have an incredible sense of smell. Grills are something that bears can be attracted to.” Wattles recommends keeping the grate nice and clean on those charcoal grills, and keeping the grease traps empty on gas grills and smokers.One mammal’s trash is another mammal’s food sourceFor residents, Wattles suggests storing garbage inside closed containers in a secure building like a garage or a shed with the doors closed and locked. For businesses or apartment complexes with dumpsters, he recommends metal tops — and keeping them closed at all times. “They'll tip over your garbage can,” said Wattles. “They can break into it if you have a latch on it.”And with garbage collection, Wattles also advises a little procrastination. “Put it out to the curb the morning of pickup, not the night before. Otherwise, overnight, bears or other animals are going to get into it.”Bear-proofing your home just might save a bear “If a bear learns to try to find food around a home, it often ends up badly for the animal,” said Wattles. ”People will often tell us, ‘I don't mind having the bear in my yard or at my bird feeder.’ But your neighbor might not. Or that same bear that's now learned to find food in your yard goes across town and breaks into someone's chicken coop and the person shoots it.”Bear encounters of the safe kind Of course, despite our best efforts, a bear encounter is always a possibility — either in a backyard or on a hike in the woods. Wattles says bears aren’t naturally aggressive toward humans. He stressed that while bear encounters are increasingly common, instances of bears attacking or injuring humans remain exceedingly rare.“Whether it's in your backyard or it's on a trail, give it space. If you're on a hiking trail and you see a bear, make sure it knows you're there. So, you know, talk to it in a loud voice. Raise your arms. Say, ‘Hey, bear, I'm over here’ and start backing up.”Still, males can be upwards of 500 pounds and eight feet long. So, if you do come across one, be smart.“It's important to remember that they are a large and powerful animal,” he said. “And so, you want to respect that. Give it space. If you see a bear, enjoy the sighting, but do it from a distance. You don't want to try to get closer to get a better picture or get a selfie.”",Local,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 08:29:29 EST",d455508f067bc7149b194f5d5dd9f71a
2579,Attorney general investigating allegations of racism in Boston police gang unit,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/16/attorney-general-investigating-allegations-of-racism-in-boston-police-gang-unit,The office will examine an alleged “pattern or practice of racially biased policing” within the Youth Violence Strike Force.,"The Massachusetts attorney general's office has launched an investigation into allegations of racial bias at the Boston Police Department’s youth gang unit and its associated database, according to a statement from the office released late Monday.The probe by state Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s civil rights division will examine an alleged “pattern or practice of racially biased policing” within the Youth Violence Strike Force, the department’s gang unit, state officials said. A Boston police spokesperson says the department will cooperate with the review. State officials say the review will look into the task force's work since 2018 with a goal of reforming the gang unit, following calls from civil rights advocates who want the database to be abolished, citing alleged racism and a lack of transparency. It comes amidst a national review of similar units following the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, who was killed during a traffic stop by five members of that city's now disbanded gang unit.""The Boston Police gang database is flawed and shouldn't be relied on to make consequential decisions about people’s lives,” said Carol Rose, the executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, one of several civil rights groups who sued the police department last year to make more information about the database public. “The database overwhelmingly targets Black and Hispanic young people, who have been labeled as gang members for little more than wearing popular brands or even becoming a victim of gang violence … the attorney general is right to investigate it."" A “gang” is qualified as three or more people who individually or together engage in criminal activity, frequent a specific location and share a common name or identifier, like a color or symbol, according to the Boston Police Department’s rules and procedures. Gang members are “active” if they have met the criteria to be associated with a gang, had contact with another gang member or participated in gang activity within the last five years. A summary provided by the department in response to the ACLU’s 2019 lawsuit showed that 90% of the 4,700 individuals in the gang database at that time were Black or Latino. “Youth have been surveilled in Dorchester and Roxbury for wearing a certain kind of hat or hanging out in a certain corner of the neighborhood,” said Massachusetts Bail Fund Director Janhavi Madabushi. “There's just such a low threshold for what gets you onto a list, and whatever gets you on that list is something that justifies you being policed or surveilled for however long the unit deems necessary.” An association with the gang database can prevent pre-trial detainees from getting access to bail for months or even years, Madabushi said. “We're seeing an increase in dangerousness hearings, where a prosecutor and judge can determine through a random set of criteria that a person is too dangerous to be let out on cash bail,” she said. Detainees take plea deals to limit jail time in what Madabushi described as “a dangerous pattern in preventive detention … detaining of people who are supposedly innocent until proven guilty, but not this time.” The investigation is ongoing and has not yet made any findings or conclusions. If issues are discovered, the goal is to work with the police department in reforming the unit and database, a spokesperson for Campbell said. Madabushi says it remains unclear whether the investigation will result in “the type of victory that our community members need and want to see,” and will require the attorney general’s office to seek out directly impacted people, many of whom might be hesitant to come forward. “I feel a little bit apprehensive to sort of rejoice before understanding how the [attorney general’s office] is going to conduct this investigation, what their considerations are,” she said. “But I hope that this surfaces what community members have been saying for a really long time.”",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 10:34:07 EST",02823a188c9d26a085841f247c477972
7721,"Faith leaders call for Gov. Healey, lawmakers to tackle housing crisis",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/16/faith-leaders-call-for-gov-healey-lawmakers-to-tackle-housing-crisis,The Greater Boston Interfaith Organization's housing agenda includes more money for public housing.,"Standing with a crowd of around 300 people outside the Massachusetts State House, the Rev. Lydia Shiu of Reservoir Church in Cambridge evoked an enduring metaphor — that of David taking on the giant Goliath in the Bible — as she spoke of the commonwealth's housing challenges.Shiu helped lead a Greater Boston Interfaith Organization rally Thursday, where the coalition of religious groups and unions called on state leaders to make housing more affordable and accessible. She said the “GBIO sling” had secured past policy wins in health care and criminal justice reform. “This is not just a housing crisis. This is a human crisis,” Shiu said. “And although the housing crisis purports itself to be a complex and complicated problem — and yes, folks, it is a hairy one — but in the face of Goliath, you cannot mess with the faith and hope of David.” With its members clad in blue T-shirts, playing trombones, and holding signs with slogans like “Praying with Our Feet,” GBIO launched a new housing justice campaign. The campaign pushes for greater state investment in public housing, zoning reforms to encourage multifamily housing in suburbs, and housing support for formerly incarcerated people. GBIO also backs legislation that would let communities impose a new fee on certain real estate transactions, with proceeds going toward affordable housing. Under the bills, filed by Cambridge Rep. Mike Connolly and Northampton Sen. Jo Comerford, cities and towns that opt in could impose a fee of between 0.5% and 2% of the purchase price on some property sales.Municipalities could choose whether the seller or buyer pays the fee, or split it between the two. The fee would kick in only above a certain price threshold: either $1 million, or above the county's median sale price for single-family homes.Communities including Boston, Somervile, Arlington and Nantucket have sought Beacon Hill's permission to establish transfer taxes in the past, but the concept has faced opposition for years from real estate industry officials, who argue the additional fee would raise costs for buyers. Phil Hillman, a strategy leader at GBIO and member of St. Paul A.M.E. Church, said the interfaith organization supports transfer tax legislation because it knows new revenue sources will be necessary before communities can create more affordable housing.""I have seen the impact of this housing crisis on my Dorchester community. This is a type of crisis that has touched family members, friends, coworkers [and] congregations,"" he said. ""For decades, our housing production has not kept up with our job growth. This has resulted in skyrocketing rents, huge increases in housing prices. If you are low-income — lower middle income — the dream of homeownership has become a nightmare.""After rallying outside the State House, GBIO members planned to meet with lawmakers and staff, asking them to support the bills and funding requests that make up the organization’s housing justice campaign. The organization wants lawmakers to double the amount of money Gov. Maura Healey proposed for public housing in her budget proposal. Healey's budget funds the public housing authorities' account at $92 million for next year, the same amount that was in this year's budget.At Thursday's rally, Arlene Hill described what it meant for her to move into public housing after spending time at a homeless shelter.“The ability to lock that door and be in my apartment, with no one telling me I had to do this or that, saved my life,” she said. GBIO said it will move forward with several action items, and that its members plan to attend committee hearings as lawmakers vet the bills on their agenda.",Politics,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:07:21 EST",da61107ffb4e07fd4f9212d6dafb5922
6720,Report: Mass. ranks most expensive for older people living alone,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/22/report-mass-ranks-most-expensive-for-older-people-living-alone,A new study shows Massachusetts’ high rents drive up the costs for adults over 65 living alone.,"New data suggests that Massachusetts is the most expensive state for older people living alone, meaning they’re more likely to face economic insecurity than older singles in any other state. Jan Mutchler, director of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston and creator of the Elder Index, joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the results of the study. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: First, can you tell us a bit more about the Elder Index — what it is, what it measures and how it’s calculated?Jan Mutchler: Of course. The Elder Index is a measurement of how much it takes for older singles and couples to live independently in their own homes. We generate a bare-bones budget. It’s a very stripped-down budget, only covers housing, food, travel — and not the fun kind of travel, just getting around to the doctors and grocery store and travel expenses — medical expenses, and a small additional amount for added things like home goods and things like that. So we calculate this bare-bones lifestyle county by county for the entire United States. And we’ve been doing this here at UMass Boston Gerontology for about 12 years. Rath: As we mentioned, Massachusetts ranks first in the most expensive states for older people living alone, even ahead of New York and California. Do we have a sense of why? And also could you put that in perspective for us, give us a sense of scale? Mutchler: A lot of times, in these conversations, it’s helpful to think about the values for older renters in good health because many people do rent. It’s also a common transition as people get older for them to move out of owned homes and into a renter situation. So looking at those numbers, the value of the Elder Index for Massachusetts singles is just over $37,000 a year. That compares to the average U.S. value of about $29,000 a year. So you’re looking at $8,000 a year more being required for older singles to stay in their homes in Massachusetts. As you said, that is higher than Hawaii, New York and California — it’s the highest in the country. Rath: To make an obvious point, that’s a huge deal if you’re living on a fixed income. Tell us a bit more about this slice of the older population we’re talking about: people who are living alone. Do the demographics of this group, say the measures of race or gender, do they track with the general population? Or are they more predominantly one thing or another?Mutchler: When you’re looking at the older population living alone, you are disproportionately looking at white women. That’s not to say that they’re all white women by any means — but essentially, women do live longer than men, so the older we’re looking in the age range, the more women we’re seeing relative to men. White people also have higher longevity, longer life on average, than many other race and ethnic groups. They do live longer than African American elders, for instance.However, a lot of the reasons we see a disproportionate share of white people living alone relative to other groups is that other groups — the Latinx, Black and Asian populations — are more likely to be living with their children. Many of them do live alone, but a larger share lives with other people than is the case in the white population.Rath: Do we have a sense that this group, the older people who are living alone, is growing as we have an aging population?Mutchler: Yes. Over many, many decades, we can track the growth in the percentage of older people living alone. A lot of that is a function of outliving spouses. It’s also a function of many people not forming marital relationships at all. It’s a function of a sort of cultural norm where independence is highly valued in many groups; a lot of people feel that they should be living alone, that that’s expected, and that’s a desired outcome for them. But that does create these financial problems that we’re documenting with the Elder Index. It’s expensive to live all by oneself and cover all of your expenses, and the older you get, the higher those expenses may be. You can experience an increase in the health care expenses as you get older, and you may require more medications, more doctor’s visits and that kind of thing.Again, our report focuses largely on people who are renters. Especially in Massachusetts, but all the way across the country, the cost of renting has just spiraled and has hit older people very hard — as anyone who’s renting. But it has had a huge impact on older people. Rath: What you just said makes this next question even harder, and that’s: What can be done about this? I mean, this ties into things like housing prices, which are hard to deal with, and we’re dealing with it in a lot of ways across the board. Are there any kinds of interventions, policies that can help alleviate these burdens for older people living alone?Mutchler: There are things that that we can do, as a society and as a state, and things that families and individuals can do. The challenge to some extent is that what we're talking about is: a lot of the people who have incomes falling below the Elder Index are people who used to be middle class. They used to be okay, but with time, as they age and have lost a spouse ... and their income really has shrunk, and they’re no longer able to really cover this bare-bones budget that we calculate through the Elder Index. Some of those people will have incomes so low that they may be eligible for things like SNAP benefits, subsidies for health insurance, subsidized housing, things of that nature. Many of them will not have incomes that are low enough. They’ll be too low to really support an adequate lifestyle, but they won’t be low enough for some of the big programs that we’re aware of. They might be eligible for other programs, like fuel assistance and other sorts of supports. Everybody — whether their income is very low, or they’re just struggling in that middle place below the Elder Index but above the poverty line — can find out about programs that they might be eligible for through their senior centers. Every community in Massachusetts has a council on aging, and they can refer you to somebody who would give you information about what you might be eligible for if you’re struggling.",Local,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:38:19 EST",80b6cd78acdeb8ac0eaf25486abd3380

Could more fraud follow?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/18/seniors-got-covid-tests-they-didnt-order-in-medicare-scam-could-more-fraud-follow,"Medicare coverage for at-home COVID-19 tests ended last week, but the scams spawned by the temporary pandemic benefit could have lingering consequences for seniors.","Medicare coverage for at-home COVID-19 tests ended last week, but the scams spawned by the temporary pandemic benefit could have lingering consequences for seniors.Medicare advocates around the country who track fraud noticed an eleventh-hour rise in complaints from beneficiaries who received tests – sometimes by the dozen – that they never requested. It's a signal that someone may have been using, and could continue to use, seniors' Medicare information to improperly bill the federal government.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General has received complaints from around the country about unsolicited tests being billed to Medicare, said a top investigator. Earlier this year, the office posted a fraud warning on its website, urging consumers to report this and other covid-related scams.""Unfortunately, most of these schemes are the result of bad actors receiving stolen Medicare beneficiary information,"" Scott Lampert, assistant inspector general for investigations, tells KFF Health News.Medicare numbers on the dark webBeing targeted once can mean a person is vulnerable to future scams. A stolen Medicare number can be used repeatedly to get payment for all kinds of things or sold to other fraudsters, says María Alvarez, who oversees New York state's Senior Medicare Patrol. The organization helps identify and educate beneficiaries about Medicare fraud throughout the country.""If you have someone's Medicare number, you can bill Medicare for procedures, tests, drugs, services, and durable medical equipment,"" Alvarez says. ""On the dark web, Medicare numbers are more valuable than credit card or Social Security numbers.""One beneficiary in Indiana suspected something was amiss after receiving 32 unrequested tests over a 10-day period, says Nancy Moore, the Senior Medicare Patrol program director for Indiana. None of the people who submitted a complaint recalled giving out their Medicare number, she said.In another variation of the problem, Medicare paid for tests for some Ohio beneficiaries who never received them, says Lisa Dalga, project manager for Ohio's Senior Medicare Patrol.""Information is the commodity of the 21st century,"" says Moore, who said she urges beneficiaries to guard their Medicare numbers.It is possible that some unwanted packages were a mistake, after pharmacies or other suppliers turned a one-time request into a continuing monthly order, a switch allowed under the program's rules that beneficiaries were responsible for correcting.Complaints around the countryAlong with those from New York, Indiana, and Ohio, Senior Medicare Patrol directors in Tennessee, Texas, and Utah told KFF Health News they noted a rise in complaints about the unwanted tests as the benefit's cutoff date approached.Alvarez says lately test suppliers had ""gotten more aggressive,"" calling and emailing seniors — something legitimate Medicare representatives do not do — as well as running misleading internet ads.When the COVID-19 public health emergency ended on May 11, Medicare stopped paying for over-the-counter tests, though it continues to cover those provided in a clinic, doctor's office, or other health care setting and processed by a laboratory. Some private Medicare Advantage plans may continue paying for the at-home tests.Medicare spent $900.8 billion providing health coverage to 64 million beneficiaries in 2021. But the program loses as much as $90 billion a year to fraudulent claims. Some of the more well-known scams have involved medical equipment like power wheelchairs.Sara Lonardo, a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, confirmed Medicare received complaints about unwanted tests but said they came from only ""a small portion"" of Medicare beneficiaries who received tests.Last year, President Joe Biden's administration offered all households a limited number of at-home tests for free, increasing access to testing as part of its effort to combat COVID.A few months later, in April 2022, CMS decided to pay for eight tests per month for those with Medicare Part B outpatient coverage, including tens of millions of seniors, one of the groups most susceptible to severe illness and death from the virus. It was the first time the agency agreed to cover non-prescription, over-the-counter products at no cost to beneficiaries.In a statement last month, federal law enforcement officials said ""wrongdoers allegedly sought to exploit the program by repeatedly supplying patients or, in some instances, deceased patients, with dozens of COVID-19 tests that they did not want or need.""So far, prosecutors at the Department of Justice have confirmed only one case involving the testing scam. A doctor in Florida and a test supplier in Georgia face charges after they were accused of illegally paying an unnamed Virginia marketing company approximately $85,000 to obtain beneficiary numbers ""for thousands of Medicare beneficiaries throughout the United States,"" according to an indictment filed by the Department of Justice last month and obtained by KFF Health News.The indictment says the pair submitted more than $8.4 million in fraudulent claims for covid tests ""regardless of whether the Medicare beneficiaries had requested or needed the tests.""$94.08 for one test?Lampert declined to say how many complaints the OIG had received, adding, ""There may or may not be some other ongoing investigations that we just cannot discuss yet.""The details of several Medicare Summary Notices — quarterly statements of services beneficiaries received — obtained by KFF Health News show Medicare paid suppliers $94.08 for at-home covid testing using a billing code for ""a single test."" Most retail pharmacies sell a two-pack of tests for about $24.Lonardo said Medicare paid up to $12 for one test and that the number of covered tests was limited to reduce ""the risk of abusive billing."" She declined to explain why the Medicare Summary Notices indicated a payment of $94.08.Beneficiaries may be the best fraud detectives for preventing medical identity theft. Senior Medicare Patrol programs encourage them to look for any items on their benefits statements — like back braces and lab tests — that Medicare paid for but that they never received.If Medicare has paid for an item once, beneficiaries may not be able to get it when they really need it — regardless of whether they actually received it.Diane Borton, a 72-year-old from New Smyrna Beach, Fla., has thrown out some of the expired tests she received but never asked for, yet she still has 25 tests. She said she called the 1-800-MEDICARE helpline twice about the unwanted packages but was told nothing could be done to stop them.Borton didn't pay for her supply, but that's not why she's concerned. ""I don't want my government paying for something that I'm not going to use and I didn't ask for,"" she said. ""I feel like it is such a waste of money.""People with Medicare or private Medicare Advantage plans who receive medical supplies they didn't order can contact the Senior Medicare Patrol Resource Center at 1-877-808-2468.KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

744,Local Jewish advocates are fighting antisemitism with a five-step plan,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/15/local-jewish-advocates-are-fighting-antisemitism-with-a-five-step-plan,"The push was unveiled as antisemitic incidents rise, both in Boston and nationwide.","Local leaders and Jewish advocates gathered at TD Garden Monday to address the alarming rise in antisemitic incidents in Boston and nationwide. The event, hosted by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, launched the group’s ‘Face Jewish Hate’ campaign in collaboration with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. Robert Kraft, the 81-year-old founder of the foundation and owner of the New England Patriots, told the crowd that the America he sees today reflects Germany in the late 1930s. “We’re seeing neo-Nazis raising swastikas and demonstrating, saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and ‘down with the Jews,’” Kraft said. “This is the United States of America in 2023. There’s no room for that kind of hate — or hate of any kind.” The campaign features a five-point plan: Face Jewish hate, empower the community, build allyship, inform and educate the next generation and strengthen communal security. Those steps were determined by a task force of community leaders and experts on combating antisemitism with antisemitic incidents on the rise. According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were over 3,600 reported antisemitic incidents across the country in 2022 — the highest number on record since the ADL began tracking the incidents more than 40 years ago. In Massachusetts, antisemitic incidents jumped 41% from 2021 to 2022. Along with top elected officials like Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Attorney General Andrea Campbell, local Jewish leaders like Kraft addressed the crowd. Speakers stood in front of screens that shared stories of local antisemitic hate crimes, like that of Rabbi Shlomo Loginski, who was stabbed eight times last summer in Brighton outside of a Jewish school. Loginski attended the event but did not address the crowd. Dr. Jeremy Schiller, who, during his tenure as the Chair of the Salem Board of Health during the COVID-19 pandemic, received several antisemitic messages and threats from people who opposed vaccination and mitigation efforts. He said that, on top of his outrage and indignation, he also felt a growing sense of loneliness and isolation from the lack of attention to antisemitic hate during the pandemic. “If [antisemitism] is not called out, if our communities stay silent, then we enter into that same dangerous debate,” he said. “That’s sending me a yellow star or depicting me with a noose around my neck to my kids, or equating COVID mitigation measures ... to Nuremberg laws.” Members of other faiths also spoke on the resurgence of antisemitism locally and nationally. Cardinal Sean Patrick O’Malley, who serves as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, said he was stunned to hear Jewish leaders’ testimony at a joint Catholic and Jewish community event about the measures Jewish folks must take to practice their faith safely. “I was horrified to hear about how they have to have their services with doors locked in all kinds of security and cameras and armed guards,” he said. “Racism and antisemitism have always been the original sins of our country, and we must never let our guard down.”",Local,"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:33:51 EST",f219556994ba52991854e5f802322f2d
2182,Do you copy? Massachusetts native and mission commander Stephen Bowen calls in to GBH from the space station,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/03/21/do-you-copy-massachusetts-native-and-commander-stephen-bowen-calls-in-to-gbh-from-the-space-station,"Bowen, originally from Cohasset, is leading the the NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 on the International Space Station. He’ll come back down to Earth this fall.","At GBH, we've had the pleasure of speaking with all kinds of leaders, change-makers and innovators in our community. We get to challenge our elected leaders and speak with seasoned experts — all of which are abundant in the Greater Boston area. But one thing we've never done is interview someone in space. So we jumped at the opportunity to speak with Cohasset native Stephen Bowen. He’s the commander for NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 who’s been at the International Space Station with three other crew members for a few weeks now. He spoke with GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about life at the International Space Station. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: The first question I have to ask you is: tell me what you’re seeing right now. Or if you’re not at a window, what would you be seeing right now?Stephen Bowen: Right now, I think we’re heading out over the Atlantic Ocean. We just passed over South America and are heading up toward the African coast on a 51.6-degree inclination. If you watch a satellite map, we’re heading up from South America to Africa. Rath: You’re up there with your new crew. Do you feel like you’re settled yet? Bowen: Not yet. It’s funny because my longest previous mission was about 16 days, so we’ve already passed that. You know, we’re starting to get settled in, and we feel like we kind of know what we’re doing, but we’re not really comfortable. Some of the guys who’ve been here obviously a lot longer than us, so it takes about a month to six weeks or so before you really feel like this is somewhat normal. Conversely, it takes about that long when you get back to Earth to feel like Earth is normal. Rath: When you get up there with a new crew, do you have overlap with the existing crew? How does that work? Bowen: Yeah. When we got up here, Crew-5 was still on board, so those four crew members and us four, and then three on the Soyuz [spacecraft]. So we had 11 people up here, which — even though the station’s pretty big, it’s an operating lab — the actual habitable volume in the places where people live is relatively small, so it seems crowded.When Crew-5 left a week or so ago, it seemed a lot emptier. They were incredibly helpful during our turnover and explainimg how things operate and how things work, which was great to have. We try to shoot for that. When we get some of that turnover, the learning curve is a lot [less steep] if you’re able to pass on your knowledge. Rath: I want to ask you a bit about your background. I’m wondering if when you’re looking out that window, if you see Massachusetts, do you ever think about that kid growing up in Cohasset, and did he ever dream of going to space?Bowen: Yeah, actually, I have done that! When I was very young — I’m old enough to have watched as we first stepped foot on the moon — I remember watching that on a black-and-white TV in our house in Cohasset. So the concept of becoming an astronaut was just sort of fantastic to me. I never really set it out as a career goal, but I just kind of went along, studied as hard as I could and always took the opportunities I could to learn more. On the path I took, I ended up as an officer in the Nuclear Submarine Corps. I applied from there, and I was fortunate enough to get selected. So it was a dream from when I was a little kid, but it wasn’t something I planned on during my early-adult career. But it’s been a fantastic 23 years so far, and it’s pretty amazing.Rath: Like those classic Apollo astronauts that you were watching on TV, you followed the Navy route.Bowen: Yes, I did. When I talk to students, I kind of emphasize the fact that what you do in high school, etcetera, if you’re having difficulty in a class or something, spend a little extra time and focus on that so you can bring your grades up and learn. Because the teachers are teaching us this stuff for a reason, so I kind of got that attitude fairly early on because I was not a good reader at first. By the time I got to be a senior in high school, I got to choose where I wanted to go to school, and the U.S. Naval Academy seemed like a great engineering school, so I went there. And it was the same thing there — I did well enough that I was able to select the Submarine Corps upon graduation. I continued to work. When you do that, you get to choose the opportunities you have, and it’s pretty exciting. It led me to the opportunity to apply to become an astronaut, which isn’t like that because there are so many qualified people. I felt like I won the lottery when I got selected.Rath: Well, you must have done well since then because you’re now commanding this mission. Is this your first mission as a commander? Bowen: Yes, my three previous missions were all shuttle missions. I basically came up to the International Space Station as a construction worker, as a contractor, helping build the International Space Station. So I have the opportunity now to live in this house, and it’s pretty amazing.Rath: Tell us a bit more about your mission. First off, the team that you’re leading is an international team.Bowen: Yeah, this is an amazing group. We’ve got three Russian cosmonauts on board. We brought one of them up with us on the SpaceX Dragon, and we have a United Arab Emirates astronaut, as well, on his first long-duration flight from the Emirates. It’s really exciting to have such a diverse group of people on board.Rath: Tell us about what your goals are and what you hope to accomplish on this.Bowen: Well, it is a national laboratory, so there are several hundred experiments going on all around us pretty much at all times. Some of them run pretty much autonomously, a lot of them require our input — our activity — to help keep them going. ... There’s a lot of sampling and just maintaining the stations.But really, what we’re doing is continuing the operation of this laboratory, this incredible asset for science that’s been manned since October of 2000. So almost 23 years now, we’ve had people permanently living in space. That’s pretty exciting in and of itself. But the research is really the goal.Rath: With all of that, it sounds like the work could never stop. How does your typical day go on the International Space Station?Bowen: Well, there’s a couple of things that are really important. They want to make sure you get enough sleep, so they do schedule a block of time for sleep. You want to get about eight hours if you can. That’s hard on the ground, and it’s hard up here. You also have to work out and do load-bearing exercises for two hours every day to ensure that you maintain your bone density and muscle mass. You have to find time to eat and take care of all of those other issues that go along with living, so you end up with about 8- to 10-hour workdays scheduled over 12 hours because you can’t put things right on top of each other. So it’s a long day, and sometimes you do end up working weekends, which is good — you’re always doing something useful and exciting.If you get a chance to look at our schedule, you can see what we do on a daily basis. You’ll see we don’t get a whole lot of spare time, which is why it’s so important to get weekends and get that opportunity for some downtime to recover, to continue the pace.Rath: Your crew went up on the International Space Station on a SpaceX spacecraft. Tell me about that, how it’s been learning to use new hardware like that. Bowen: Oh, it’s so different because I grew up on the space shuttle. When I got the astronaut office, I did three shuttle flights, and I was the flight engineer for my first flight. We had hundreds of switches and circuit breakers and dials and knobs and displays that really required some manual intervention at different points in order to make things happen. The Dragon spacecraft is almost entirely automated, so in reality, we’re monitoring systems. Our input, our interface is not those switches and circuit breakers — it’s a touch screen. So it’s incredibly different, an incredibly capable machine, and it’s doing its job well for us so far.Rath: Will you use the Dragon capsule to get home, or does the outgoing crew use that?Bowen: We’ll use our own capsule heading home in about six months or so. You splash down in the ocean, similar to the way they did in the Apollo days. And that’s because the weather constraints are pretty tight, so that’s one reason Crew-5 was here for a few extra days with us. You’ve gotta make sure the weather’s safe to come home, and that’s how we’ll be getting home in about five or six months.Rath: Speaking of new hardware, I have to imagine this is a pretty exciting time to be an astronaut with the coming plans from NASA. There are going to be additional moon missions. So as someone who grew up watching those Apollo missions, tell me what it feels like.Bowen: It’s been incredibly exciting, and it’s been getting more and more exciting over the past half decade or so. Once the Artemis Mission started to become more realistic, commercial crew came online and brought that other set of vehicles and commercial crew vehicles. We’ve got SpaceX; hopefully, we’ll get Boeing up here soon. That’s incredibly exciting, incredibly amazing to see. And now, with Artemis and Gateway and potential missions to the moon, it’s absolutely amazing. I have friends that have been at NASA a lot longer than me, and they will tell you that this is the most exciting time they’ve ever had at NASA.Rath: Is there a kind of dissonance or a real contrast when you’re docking the Dragon spacecraft at the International Space Station, which has now been manned for over 20 years now. Bowen: It’s pretty amazing. I came through the hatch, and it looks familiar to when I left it 10, 12 years ago. But it’s just so much busier. Having that extra crew member that the Dragon capsule provides just adds that much more capability to the laboratory itself, and it’s really exciting. It’s an incredibly bustling place, and that’s great to see. Rath: Stephen, our time has just flown by — you can probably tell how much I’m loving talking to you about all of this. Before we have to let you go, is there anything you want to say to your friends and family back here on Earth and in Massachusetts?Bowen: I’d like to say hello! I’m really enjoying the weather up here. I know the weather down there has been tough at times these past few months. I guess it was cold and dreary yesterday. I’m looking forward to getting home in the fall time frame. After we get back to Houston and I get some recovery, I’m probably going to head back up to New England and head up to see family in Boston. So it’s going to be exciting. And, you know, maybe we’ll have an NBA and NHL championship to celebrate, as well.",Science and Technology,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 18:53:24 EST",7657993ff0a665fa9c4dde9f80ca6a0c
3066,"Veteran congressman, sitting local politicians will testify against Boston in federal redistricting case",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/13/veteran-congressman-sitting-local-politicians-will-testify-against-boston-in-federal-redistricting-case,The lawsuit lays bare a rift among Boston Democrats.,"A handful of incumbent politicians are seeking to testify in the federal court case challenging the legality of Boston’s voter district maps, including U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, who has served in Congress since 2001.Rep. Lynch represents Massachusett’s 8th District, which includes part of Boston. Court documents filed last week show Lynch as scheduled to offer in-person testimony when arguments to bar the City of Boston from enacting its redistricting maps are heard Tuesday. A second hearing date in the case is scheduled for later this month. Others intending to testify this month include Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty, State Senator Nick Collins and former City Councilor and recently retired City Clerk Maureen Feeney.The lawsuit lays bare a rift among Boston Democrats who have drifted into two camps in recent years — in one lies an increasingly progressive crop of new politicians, in the other, the centrists of the old guard.The rift, which plays out frequently among the historically diverse Boston City Council, has tended to fall along racial lines, with councilors of color typically aligning in the progressive bloc, and white councilors, particularly those with ties to the neighborhoods that represent traditional centers of white power and influence, filing into the centrist bloc.Race and power emerged as a flashpoint during the redistricting process as the council attempted to address an explosion of growth in the South Boston Seaport neighborhood and a simultaneous loss of Black residents across the city over the last decade.Between September 2021 and November 2022, councilors involved in the map-making process attempted to remedy the issues by shaving off a portion of the overgrown South Boston district and adding it to a neighboring Dorchester district, triggering a shift in the bottom portion of the latter’s boundary lines.Many white politicians from those two districts resisted the shift.In one community meeting, former Clerk Feeney, who represented the Dorchester district implored council members not to shift the area’s boundaries. “Don’t take power from one neighborhood to give it to another neighborhood,” she said.In an affidavit, At-Large Councilor Erin Murphy claimed that the approved map “is based on race in violation of the Voting Rights Act” and was designed “to diminish the voting power of white voters in City Council District 3 whose rights are sacred under the VRA and the 14th Amendment.”Council President Flynn, who currently represents the South Boston district, also called for a halt to the map’s approval a day before it was scheduled to go to the floor for a vote in November.The council map-making process ended on a sour note the following day when Dorchester Councilor Frank Baker accused his Irish-born Protestant colleague, Liz Breadon of Allston-Brighton, of deliberately attempting to disempower Irish Catholics in the city with the map.The current redistricting legal case was initially brought by a coalition of predominantly white, South Boston-based political power players, including former State Rep. and former Hingham Selectman Paul Gannon, an attorney in the now-federal legal challenge.Gannon and Robert O’Shea of South Boston’s Democratic Ward Committee unsuccessfully attempted to block the council from approving the map with a request for a temporary restraining order in state court. In it, they alleged council members violated open meeting law on three separate occasions by meeting with a quorum, or simple majority, of redistricting committee members without giving advance notice. According to state law, if a quorum of a public body wants to discuss public business within that body’s jurisdiction, they must do so during a properly posted meeting.Superior Court Judge Anthony M. Campo denied the immediate bid to block the vote.Later, the focus of the case shifted when the South Boston coalition amended their court complaint by adding several constituents of color to their cadre and alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th Amendment.Lawyers for the City of Boston eventually moved the case to federal court.Lynch was not immediately available for comment regarding his role in the lawsuit, but the congressman has previously written in opposition to the redistricting map. In a November letter to the state court judge, he claimed the new map “arbitrarily and recklessly” divided the communities in a pair of South Boston housing projects that fall within his Congressional district.“These public housing communities are classic communities of interest in the legal sense as they predominately consist of non-English speaking, low-income families of color who are kindred in socioeconomic status, education, employment and their common identity as recently arrived immigrants,” Lynch wrote. Furthermore, he argued that the new map could “weaken the voting strength” of these like-minded voters in Boston’s future elections.Judge Patti B. Saris, a Clinton-era nominee, is now presiding over the case.A coalition of advocacy groups devoted to serving marginalized populations, including the Boston Branch of the NAACP, Massachusetts Voter Table and the Chinese Progressive Association, are planning to show up to Tuesday’s hearing as a show of support for Boston’s latest redrawn map. The groups filed a shared legal brief in support of the city’s map. The federal case adds another layer of tension to Boston’s struggle with race and voting power within the storied and changing city.",Politics,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 14:39:34 EST",a9ff7e0f7e0f473d6769355d75837907
5495,A Lowell college baseball player was kicked off the team. He believes racism is at the root of it.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/13/a-lowell-college-baseball-player-was-kicked-off-the-team-he-believes-racism-is-at-the-root-of-it,"Cedric Rose kept a diary, he says, for his mental health. Then school officials questioned him about it.","Shortly after arriving on the University of Massachusetts Lowell campus in the spring of 2021 on a partial baseball scholarship, Cedric Rose, a muscular 5’10” infielder from Pittsfield, began typing his observations in a diary. Rose, a transfer student from a community college in Herkimer, N.Y., hoped Lowell would be the next step in his plan to one day play in the major leagues. Baseball means everything to him. ""It's a life to me. It's a lifestyle. It's my passion. It's everything I think about when I wake up. It's what I've done my whole life and what I surround everything by,"" Rose told GBH News, sitting in the bleachers of the empty UMass Lowell baseball stadium this spring. Last year, he played in 52 of the team’s 58 games in 2022 and made the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star team. John Duke, the parent of a UMass student who plays on the same team, described Rose's level of play as remarkable. “One of the most extraordinary plays I saw last year was him scooping up a bunt and immediately turning and firing to second base and creating a double play.” But Rose’s baseball dreams hit an abrupt setback when he was dismissed from the team on February 14 by Ken Harring, UMass Lowell’s head baseball coach. And it’s not clear why he was cut. An email he received in March from the athletic department explaining his dismissal shed little light. “Your dismissal is based on violations of the team expectations and philosophy document that all players are required to uphold,” UMass Lowell's Athletics Director Peter Casey wrote. Neither Rose nor his lawyer has seen the philosophy document, and GBH News has not been able to obtain a copy.It’s a case of competing narratives that are now the task of an independent investigator to wade through, and possibly the federal courts. And for the 22-year-old baseball player, a decision that was made behind closed doors could make or break his career. Because Rose thinks the reason he lost out on his final season — the last season professional scouts could see him play — was his diary. More specifically, he thinks he was cut because he was keeping track of racially insensitive comments made by Harring, and the coach found out that Rose was writing them down. Ken Harring’s coaching record in the America East Conference is testimony to his success. Harring was named the Northeast-10 Conference coach of the year at Saint Anselm College in 2004 before taking a job as UMass Lowell’s head coach for the 2005 season, where he's been for the last 19 seasons. He has recruited some of the strongest players in the country, and a half dozen River Hawks have been selected in the Major League Baseball draft since Harring arrived. Under his leadership, the team moved up to play in Division I baseball, the highest level of competition in college athletics. And in 2022, Harring notched his 500th career college coaching victory. Harring told the Lowell Sun he believes he’s had an impact on every kid he’s coached. “Every kid I’ve had — whether they started four years or transferred after one year — I’ve loved them all. I pinch myself every day that I get a chance to do this.” But Cedric Rose has doubts about that. He says Harring treated him differently from the other, almost exclusively white players on the team. But the head coach controls their playing time. “Nobody else has treated me the way he's treated me,” Rose told GBH News. “And he's the one who writes our lineups. There's nothing I can do about that. There's nobody I can talk to. So, I decided the best thing to do is just write to myself.” His journal entries — some undated — include suggestions that Harring was singling him out because of his race. “I tell Ken Harring and some guys on the team that I'm going to the Student Athlete of Color affinity group,” Rose wrote on Sept. 16, 2022. “And Ken says, ‘I actually have a problem with that whole group. If you guys want to be treated equal, I want the same rights. Why can't I go to the group?’” In the spring of 2021, Rose wrote that Harring approached him and another player of color to talk about politics. The journal entry says Harring told the players “I can complain about gas prices because that’s your guy’s guy [President Joe Biden] who did that not mine ... I didn't vote for him.’” Rose wrote that he was mystified by the exchange. “I have never once talked about politics with him,” Rose wrote two years ago. “He has no clue my stand on anything politics but he came up to the 2 colored kids assuming we voted for Biden and wanted to let us know that he voted for Trump.” (A review of Harring’s social media accounts shows he has retweeted messages from far-right individuals, including Candace Owens, a Black talk show host and activist who became a high-profile defender of former president Donald Trump.)One of Rose’s journal entries recounts wearing an America East athletic conference T-shirt that said “Equality” during batting practice. “After a couple guys hit BP, Ken turned around looks at me ... with a disgusted face and tells me ‘Go take that shirt off now,’” Rose wrote. Another journal entry describes Harring confronting Rose and another player of color at the batting cages to complain about rap music. “What is so great about rap music, all it is is glorifying drugs, gangs, violence and mistreating women,” Rose recounted Harring saying. Harring did not respond to GBH News’ efforts to reach him for this story. Rose shared the contents of his diary with two teammates whom he roomed with in an apartment near the sprawling campus. For reasons unknown, Rose says, in late January one of his teammates informed Harring that Rose was taking notes. Days later, on February 8, Harring sent an urgent text message to Rose calling for a morning meeting in his office with the coaching staff. “And they sit me down,” Rose said. “And the first thing that comes out of Ken Harring's mouth is, ‘Your teammates are coming up to us, telling us, you feel like you’re getting treated differently because of the color of your skin.’ He stares me in the eyes and says, ‘OK, let’s get transparent. Do you think I’m racist?’”Rose said he did not answer directly but implied that he thought Harring was “prejudiced,” based on what he had observed. The exchange, described as tense, went on for more than 30 minutes. The young baseball player left the meeting angry and feeling powerless. He went home and punched a hole in a wall of the apartment he shared with two teammates. The next day he was instructed by the coach not to come to practice.Less than a week later, on February 14, Rose was dismissed from the team. A week after he was ordered to clean out his locker, Rose, his sister and his parents — Michelle Johnston and Carl Rose — met with Harring and other school officials at the family's request. When people with the school asked for an explanation of the diary, family members said that Rose wrote things down as an outlet for his mental health, not as a weapon to be used against Harring. According to notes taken by Rose’s family at the meeting, the coach scoffed at the idea that his dismissal from the team had anything to do with race and offered various reasons for kicking their 22-year old son off the team. According to the parents, Harring said he was concerned about their son's mental health, citing Rose’s alleged use of the N-word in the locker room, implicitly threatening a white roommate by playing rap music with lyrics that reference snitching, and punching a hole in the wall of his bedroom after his initial meeting with the coaching staff. Rose said one of the assistant coaches has also played rap music in the locker room and denies ever threatening his teammates, whether through music or directly. None of those reasons was explicitly cited in the Athletic Department’s official letter of dismissal in March.After an initial inquiry into the allegations, Casey, UMass Lowell’s athletic director, sent an email to Rose on March 8 upholding Harring’s decision to oust him from the team.But after Rose and his family complained, university officials in March hired an outside investigator to get to the bottom of the conflict, which Boston civil rights attorney Ed Burley — who represents the family — said is meaningful. “The university looked into it and they found that that it had sufficient merit to open a full investigation,” he told GBH News. The university issued a statement to GBH News, saying, “UMass Lowell is committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming environment for its entire campus community. Just as it does for any allegations of discrimination, the university is investigating this matter in a prompt, fair and confidential manner.” People in Rose’s life describe him as a skilled and affable player. Brent Edmunds, who was an assistant baseball coach at UMass Lowell until he left the team last year, described Rose as “very, very talented” and someone “who put in a good effort.” “He was well-liked by his teammates. You know, never — never really showed anything negative,” Edmunds said in a telephone interview with GBH News. One of Rose’s teammates — speaking anonymously for fear of “being taken out of the lineup” and hurting his baseball career — echoed Edmunds’ characterization, saying, “Cedric got along with everyone.” He said he often heard Rose complain about being “treated differently” by Harring.Rose’s father, Carl, is Black. His mother, Michelle Johnston, is white. She said she believes her son, and believes race is at the core of why he was kicked off the team.“As a mom, a white mom of a young man of color, how do I support my son other than to stand behind him?” she said. “This literally started as him [the coach] learning about a journal that Cedric was only doing to help himself work through stuff. And it led to a coach trying to protect himself.”But Ann Hardy Draper of Lowell doesn’t buy it.Draper is the unofficial “den mother” for the River Hawks. Her son just wrapped up his last year on the team. “I’m coming to the end of the fourth season that I’ve been around the team. I’m usually the one that sends out emails about changes in schedule or organizing group gifts and things like that,” she said. She dismisses the accusations leveled at the coach and said she believes the Roses are using the issue of racism to “smear” Harring. Based on conversations with other parents and team members, her understanding is that Rose was dismissed “after an incident where he had torn apart the apartment he lives in with two other players, another one of whom is also a minority player. He made death threats. And he would play really loud music and crank it louder when it talked about killing white people.” Rose denies threatening anyone. “I never heard my son come home and say that Cedric had brought up anything about there being a racial component or about being treated differently at all when he was let go from the team,” Draper told GBH News.Draper also said that race did not come up in a private Facebook exchange she had with Michelle Johnston after Cedric left the team, but Johnston raised it subsequently in a public online forum. “The parents I've spoken to are disgusted [about the allegations of racism], as disgusted as I am,” Draper said. “First of all, if Ken was a racist, in my opinion, why did he recruit Cedric? Why?”She added: “If you really thought the coaches and the athletic department were racist, why would you want him back on that team?” Cedric’s father, Carl Rose, said there have been other racist incidents at the university that have deeply impacted his family. Most disturbing, he said, was the annual “Hot Stove” team fundraiser in February of last year attended by parents, the coaching staff and team members that featured a white comedian. The comedian made Carl Rose, the only dark-skinned man in the room, the butt of racist jokes, causing “extreme discomfort” for him and his family. “I was upset, embarrassed,” Carl Rose said. “And the worst part was after he was done, Ken came over to me and put the light back on me saying, ‘Oh, I know, Carl, you felt uncomfortable, because I sure did!’” Draper was also there that night, but she remembers the incident differently. “His jokes got progressively ugly and racist,” she said. “It was so embarrassing. Ken got out of his seat and went right over to the table where Cedric’s parents were, apologizing up and down. To their credit, they said they understood that it wasn’t [Ken’s] fault.” The incident weighed heavily on the family, even though Carl Rose said his son was never an activist or very conscious of racial issues. Still, for a young Black man, simply stepping onto a baseball field is a measure of activism. There are very few Black collegiate baseball players in the country.“It is a scarcity, to say the least,” said Noah Jackson, an associate head baseball coach at the University of California-Berkeley, who, as a Black coach, is also a rarity in college baseball. “It is still a sport that is a pay-to-play sport for a lot of kids,” Jackson said. “It costs an exorbitant amount of money to play summer travel baseball, and then it costs an exorbitant amount of money to come to college and play baseball because you still have to pay since there are no full scholarships.” Jackson said racism in sports also cannot be dismissed as a factor for the scarcity of Black athletes playing the game today.In Division I men’s baseball, nearly four in five of the student athletes are white, according to a 2021-2022 report compiled by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. Only 4.2% of players were Black or African American. And the lack of representation on the college level on the field and in coaching is reflected in the MLB. According to TIDES, 7.2% of MLB players were Black on Opening Day last March. Cedric Rose said he feels a personal responsibility to reverse this trend in baseball. “I’ve never had too many African American teammates,” he said. “I think the most I’ve had on one team at one time was, like, four. So, it speaks volumes going out there and proving that we can play at a high level. It means a lot.” UMass Lowell’s athletic department has been lauded for its efforts to establish inclusivity and equity. It scored a perfect 100 on the NCAA's 2022 Athletic Equality Index, one of just 15 Division I athletic departments to do so, according to the NCAA. Casey, the athletic director, was quoted in a UMass Lowell press release last year, saying, “I am so proud that we continue to be among the leaders in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion, helping to set a standard in college athletics, but I know that there is always more work that can be done and we must continue to push ourselves in this area every day.""The Rose family attorney, Ed Burley, who is chair of legal redress for the local NAACP, said he plans to file a formal complaint in federal court on behalf of the family following the expected release of the university’s investigation. He told GBH News he would like UMass Lowell to live up to its reputation, but believes the Harring affair flouts the school’s promised goals of equality. “Cedric, by keeping a diary, has engaged in protected conduct, which is complaining or memorializing either harassment or hostile work environment claims,” Burley told GBH News. “And then for doing so, he’s been retaliated against.” Meanwhile, the baseball season has ended and Cedric Rose did not get to play this spring. That meant the collegiate and professional scouts did not see him on the field. But he said he is determined to find a way to return to the game. A few weeks ago, Rose graduated with a degree in economics from UMass Lowell, but even as a college graduate, he still hopes to be seen by other scouts.Now, he is playing occasionally with a summer league. He said he hopes that will lead to an invitation to play regularly, somewhere.“A couple of weeks into the summer, people [on summer teams] will start dropping off left and right,” he said, “whether that’s injuries, whether they hate where they are and just want to go home. And hopefully I get a phone call to go play baseball, and then I’ll leave that day.”",Local,"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 05:00:55 EST",13b30f0932eb8106bf1725f706c106d0
5275,The 2 expelled members of the 'Tennessee 3' win back their state House seats,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/04/the-2-expelled-members-of-the-tennessee-3-win-back-their-state-house-seats,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Reps. Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, who became Democratic heroes as members of the ""Tennessee Three,"" reclaimed their legislative seats Thursday after they were expelled for involvement in a gun control protest on the House floor.","NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Reps. Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, who became Democratic heroes as members of the ""Tennessee Three,"" reclaimed their legislative seats Thursday after they were expelled for involvement in a gun control protest on the House floor.The young Black lawmakers were reinstated by local officials after being booted from the GOP-dominated Statehouse, but only on an interim basis. They advanced Thursday through a special election to fully reclaim their positions. Both faced opponents in districts that heavily favor Democrats and easily defeated them according to unofficial results from the Tennessee's Secretary of State's office.Jones, who lives in Nashville, was up against Republican candidate Laura Nelson. Meanwhile, Pearson, from Memphis, faced independent candidate Jeff Johnston.""I think if we keep running this race, there will be victory after victory after victory,"" Pearson said to supporters on Thursday. He stressed that his victory was largely possible due to Black women and the organizing work they had done to make him and other politicians successful.Thursday's election came as lawmakers are preparing to return to Nashville later this month for a special session to address possibly changing the state's gun control laws. While Jones and Pearson's reelection to their old posts won't make a significant dent to the Republican supermajority inside the Legislature, they are expected to push back heavily against some of their GOP colleagues' policies.Jones and Pearson were elected to the Statehouse last year. Both lawmakers flew relatively under the radar, even as they criticized their Republican colleagues' policies. It wasn't until this spring that their political careers received a boost when they joined fellow Democrat Rep. Gloria Johnson in a protest for more gun control on the House floor.The demonstration took place just days after a fatal shooting in Nashville at a private Christian school where a shooter killed three children and three adults. As thousands of protesters flooded the Capitol building to demand that the Republican supermajority enact some sort of restrictions on firearms, the three lawmakers approached the front of the House chamber with a bullhorn, and joined the protesters' chants and cries for action.Republican lawmakers quickly declared that their actions violated House rules and moved to expel their three colleagues — an extraordinary move that's been taken only a handful of times since the Civil War.The move briefly left about 140,000 voters in primarily Black districts in Nashville and Memphis with no representation in the Tennessee House.Ultimately, Johnson, who is white, narrowly avoided expulsion while Pearson and Jones were booted by the predominantly white GOP caucus.House Republican leaders have repeatedly denied that race was a factor in the expulsion hearings. Democrats have disagreed, with Johnson countering that the only reason that she wasn't expelled was due to her being white.The expulsions drew national support for the newly dubbed ""Tennessee Three,"" especially for Pearson and Jones' campaign fundraising. The two raised more than $2 million combined through about 70,400 campaign donations from across the country. The amount is well beyond the norm for Tennessee's Republican legislative leaders and virtually unheard of for two freshman Democrats in a superminority.Meanwhile, more than 15 Republican lawmakers had funneled cash to fund campaign efforts of Jones' Republican opponent, Nelson. Nelson has raised more than $34,000 for the race. Pearson's opponent, Johnston, raised less than $400 for the contest.Thursday's election will also influence two other legislative seats.In Nashville, community organizer Aftyn Behn and former Metro Councilmember Anthony Davis were vying to advance to the general election for a House seat in a district in the city's northeastern region that opened after Democratic Rep. Bill Beck died in June.Meanwhile in eastern Tennessee, Republican Timothy Hill faced Democrat Lori Love in a general election for Republican-leaning District 3. The seat was left empty when former Republican Rep. Scotty Campbell resigned following a finding that he had violated the Legislature's workplace discrimination and harassment policy.Hill served in the state House from 2012 until 2020 and rose to the position of majority whip. He later left his seat to run for an open U.S. House seat in 2020, but lost in a crowded primary to current Republican U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger.

3483,Days (and nights) of Punk: Michael Grecco's photos show Boston's '70s and '80s punk scene,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/15/days-and-nights-of-punk-michael-greccos-photos-show-bostons-70s-and-80s-punk-scene,Some never-before-scene photos are now on exhibition in the South End.,"Boston’s punk scene in the late 1970s and early '80s was marked by transformation. “Boston went from being sort of a hippie, free love, granola folk rock kind of town to the emergence of Reagan, Reaganomics,” photographer Michael Grecco told GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel. “There was sort of a feeling of impending dread in a lot of society. And I think that this punk scene, it was a total rebellion.”Grecco, who worked for the Associated Press at the Massachusetts State House during the day, would ditch his khakis and button-up shirts at night for tight jeans, ripped-up T-shirts and leather jackets. He’d grab his camera and go to see a show. Now his photos, some of which have never been seen before, are on display at the Anderson Yezerski Gallery in the South End as part of an exhibit called Days of Punk. His photos include members of local bands, like Human Sexual Response and Mission of Burma. They also captured The Clash, Devo and Billy Idol. “Boston was the first city in every tour in the United States of every band that came through,” Grecco said. “Every band came through here. There was something you can do every single night of the week. And I never stayed home.”Grecco’s archivist, Mykle Parker, suggested unearthing some of the photos for the new exhibition. “The stuff sat in my files. I kind of ignored it. I didn't use it for my portfolio,” Grecco said. “And then my archivist started pulling stuff out. She's like, 'You've got to do something with this.'”Grecco grew up in suburban New York “as a very sort of mothered, overly protected kid.”He started taking trains into New York City as a teenager to see live music, especially jazz. When he moved to Boston, he wandered into The Rathskeller — Kenmore Square’s legendary punk club, open from 1974 to 1997 — “and was just, like, absolutely blown away by this scene.”The music industry was at a pivotal moment, Grecco said. “It's the rebellion that changed our entire music system,” he said. “You had punk on one side changing FM radio, especially the album-oriented rock stations out there. And then you had rap on the other side, blowing up things like Motown and these very slick, produced bands and music that didn't seem authentic.” The punk scene was neither slick nor heavily produced, Grecco said. Tickets were usually around $5, and people like Grecco who were part of the music scene sometimes got in for free because they knew the bouncers. “It was also a time where we had unfettered access and you would have things like, you know, Lux Interior of The Cramps performing at The Channel and his pants fall off and he performs the second half of the set naked,” Grecco said. “Then you go backstage to photograph Lux, and he puts his private part in a hot dog bun to do his portrait. I mean, that just wouldn't happen today.”",Local,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 13:29:07 EST",9d1cb725ad89d24e36b99f3ccbf331d7

It was shocking and frightening, especially for Ukrainians living abroad and watching the war unfold in their home country. That includes MIT student Sasha Horokh, who is director of the nonprofit Mriya and a volunteer with the Ukrainian Cultural Center of New England. They joined GBH Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about the last year. This transcript has been lightly edited. Siegel: Sasha, you were born in Ukraine and lived in Kiev before coming to school in Massachusetts. And you flew home over the last year to deliver humanitarian aid in your home country. How have you seen things change in Ukraine over the last year? Horokh: That's a very good question, a pretty hard one. I think that one of the hardest things was to watch it from here, from the U.S. Because first, when you read the news about all the horrible things happening and especially about them happening right next to your home, right next to your family, about your friends dying — it's very hard to be living in a place where people just go on with their lives and somehow expect you to move on and go on with your life too. When I was in Ukraine, it was a lot easier. I spent summer there volunteering on the ground and since January it has been an Independent Activities Period in Ukraine. It is a period in MIT. So that's what I did. Being in the Ukraine is easy in the sense of, it gives you some sense of unity. And there actually was a lot of it over the last year. I feel that Ukrainian society very much united to stand for freedom and independence. And it shows in so many things: It shows in the way people treat each other, even outsiders, strangers. It shows in the way that people choose to speak to each other, both in terms of language and words they use. It also shows a lot in the way that people help each other whenever something happens. I think most people in Ukraine by now are either in the Ukrainian army defending the country or volunteering to do something to help defenders or people who are victims of Russian violence. Alston: Sasha, how have your loved ones back home been, and what's the past year been like for them? Horokh: It's been terrible. I lost many friends. There were like 10, but one by one over the last year.Alston: I'm sorry. Horokh: My family is alive, and I'm very thankful for that. My dad stays in Kiev. That's the capital of Ukraine. It's constantly bombed, as well as any other big cities. He is there alone because my mom and my younger sister are now refugees in the U.K. My grandparents are also in Kiev, and they cannot even move to the bomb shelter because my grandad is partially paralyzed. And my other grandparents are in Sumy, that's an eastern Ukrainian city. My grandma watched Russian tanks having a battle with the Ukrainian army on her street and she was watching it from her basement window. My almost 75-year-old grandad was biking five miles one way to the hospital and back because it's where he works, and if he took a car, it would be too likely to be shot during the battles in the city. So they definitely could be better. But yeah, they're alive. And the bar is low, but I'm thankful for that. Siegel: Having these conversations with your family and seeing what people you know have experienced back home, you mentioned earlier how odd it can be to live in a place where life is continuing to go on. And I think for a lot of people — I don't know what the right word is, it feels like people have become jaded to the war. It's been a year at this point. And I'm curious what you think people living in Massachusetts, or living somewhere else and listening right now, should know about your experience and the experience of people back home that's impossible for them to understand given where we are. Horokh: I agree. It's impossible to understand for people how it feels and how it goes. And I feel that it's a good thing that people do not understand that, because before it happens, you have a completely different idea of it. But I think the important point is to remember that the war is going on, or a battle is going on. And actually, every next day it's harder and harder. It's more cruel and more cruel. And Russian war crimes are more terrifying and more terrifying. So I think it's important that we do not get used to this, and to keep supporting Ukraine. As a director at my nonprofit, it's also very hard to fundraise for Ukraine lately. It gets harder and harder every next day because as people get used to war and move on with their lives, they are less and less willing to support. But the battle still goes, so we have to do everything that you could. Alston: Sasha, to that point, and to what Jeremy was saying earlier: We've been hearing about numerous polls that show that American public support for the aid that the U.S. is giving to Ukraine is waning, because they feel like there are other places where those resources could be allocated. What would you say to those people? Horokh: I feel it's very important to realize that supporting Ukraine is not charity. The way U.S. supports Ukraine, it supports all the values that U.S. stands for, which are democracy, freedom and a civilized world that Ukraine is standing for, not only for itself. Also, there was a Budapest Memorandum in 1994, if I'm not mistaken, where Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons. And several countries joined safety assurances for Ukraine to ensure that if anyone attacks, Ukraine is going to have all the resources it needs to defend itself. One of those countries was Russia, which is pretty ironic. But among other countries there also was the U.S. So I feel it's important for people to realize that supporting Ukraine is keeping up to the words they gave, and keeping the value of their promises high.",Local,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 13:31:16 EST",5213f337c85e4ad4a55d2b37013ae9c2

6881,Boston’s original marathon bombing memorial lives a quiet afterlife in a West Roxbury archive,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/12/bostons-original-marathon-bombing-memorial-lives-a-quiet-afterlife-in-a-west-roxbury-archive,"The materials and mementos people dropped off are preserved for posterity, but the public is staying away.","In the days after the Boston Marathon bombings, people flocked to the scene of the attacks and left behind thousands of items as tokens of grief and solidarity, converting Boylston Street and then Copley Square into an impromptu shrine. Among the objects deposited was a green apron from a nearby Starbucks, covered with handwritten messages that showed people struggling to find an emotional path forward. “Forgive but never forget,” one message read. “Don’t let hate live in your heart. We are a strong and powerful city.”The attacks on the marathon have become an indelible part of Boston history, and two permanent markers now stand at the blast sites. But that apron, and the other items that were once part of the temporary memorial, have, in fact, been largely forgotten — even though they’ve been preserved in perpetuity and are accessible to the general public.A few weeks after the bombings, in June 2013, the temporary memorial was taken down. Since then, a huge swath of the objects that used to make up the memorial have been kept at the Boston City Archives in West Roxbury, a low-slung, nondescript building located near a Home Depot by Boston’s southwestern border.Here, stored in the archives’ cavernous records room, you can find almost all of the temporary memorial’s so-called flat objects, including drawings, cards, notes, flags, race bibs, police patches and whiteboards that bear greetings and condolences from Boston and much further away. Other, more unwieldy objects, including most of the running shoes emblazoned with messages that came to define the memorial, are stored offsite but can also be retrieved for public viewing.Recently, Marta Crilly, a city archivist, arrayed a selection of objects, including the Starbucks apron, in a small area for viewing by GBH News. She also discussed the emotional bond she and her colleagues have formed with the items over the years, and the drop-off she’s recently observed in public interest.Taking down the memorial a decade ago “was quite a surreal experience for us,” Crilly recalled. “Because we’re certainly used to bringing records into the archives, but we’re usually working with records [for which] there’s been a distance of time. And these were records documenting a historical event that we had all lived through, that had just happened a couple of weeks earlier.”Crilly said she’s still struck by the massive wave of sentiment these artifacts can convey a decade later.“Something that always jumps out to me is just the sheer volume of people ... who were moved to write a message,” she said. “The outpouring of support and solidarity felt overwhelming to me, as someone who is a Bostonian — and overwhelming in a good way, in a way that we felt very supported. Always, still, I feel kind of taken aback by it.”But Crilly and her colleagues have few occasions to access this material. In 2014, to mark the first anniversary of the attacks, the collection was used to create an exhibit at the Boston Public Library titled “Dear Boston: Messages from the Marathon Memorial.” Pieces have also been shared with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and several other institutions. In 2020, an exhibit was planned at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum before COVID-19 derailed it.Over the past decade, though, engagement by the general public has gone from limited to almost nonexistent. In that span, Crilly said, requests by the public to access the collection have dwindled from three to five annually to about one. The type of patron seeking access has shifted too, from what Crilly described as people with personal connections to the memorial to academic researchers.There are several possible explanations. Geographically, Boston’s archives are off the beaten path, which could deter some would-be visitors. Many people may not even know the materials exist and can be easily accessed. Also, the items in West Roxbury can be viewed almost effortlessly at a digital archive maintained by Northeastern University — though those pixelated equivalents lack the evocative power of their physical counterparts.But there’s another, deeper explanation at play, too.In 2013, when then-Mayor Tom Menino announced that the temporary memorial in Copley Square would be removed, he implied that it had been part of an early, raw stage of communal grieving that Boston was ready to leave behind.“It is my hope,” Menino wrote to survivors and victims’ families, “that the respectful closing of the temporary memorial will help us all look to the future.”Menino’s words pointed to questions that transcend Boston. In recent decades, in the United States and elsewhere, temporary memorials have become a ubiquitous response to events in which lives are lost and communities are traumatized, including terrorist attacks, police killings and mass shootings.Erika Doss, a professor of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame, has written on the topic. She says temporary memorials give the public a predictable, accessible way to engage tragedies that might otherwise seem intolerable. It’s a secular ritual, of sorts: participants bring physical offerings to the site of the trauma, scrutinize the objects left by others, take a picture or two, and watch as the memorial they helped create continues to grow. In the process, despair that might have been private and passive becomes public, communal and active.“I find it fascinating,” Doss said. “[It’s] a big change from, let’s say, the 1950s — the postwar period — when there is a much more constricted sense of what your emotional expression should be in the public sphere.”But then, time and again, the memorials come down. And at this point, Doss says, local officials face a huge challenge: As the use of temporary memorials has proliferated, so has a belief that the items they contained need to be preserved for posterity. It’s a belief she regards with skepticism.“We’re talking about filling up museums, archives, and collecting agencies with stuff like paper, artificial flowers, teddy bears that don’t look too great — stuff that just takes up space,” Doss said. “I’m not arguing that it’s not valuable. But I am questioning this imperative that we seem to have to save and preserve.”Boston, however, has already made the choice to save and preserve. And while some of items in the archives may feel dispensable today — for example, mass-produced placards that pair a brand name with the phrase “Boston Strong” — others can still pack an emotional punch.As I browsed through items left on Boylston Street in the bombings’ immediate aftermath, I was stopped cold by a note to Martin Richard, the youngest victim, from another child.“You had a lot to live for, you had anything to do with your life,” Richard’s correspondent wrote. “Now, you’re up in Heaven with God who will watch over you little guy!”Something about that piece — the childish script, the lurch from despair to optimism, the memory it triggered of Richard’s once-ubiquitous face — instantly made me feel like I was back in April 2013.Do items with that kind of power deserve to be seen by more people? After visiting the archives, I spoke with Rainey Tisdale, who led the effort by local cultural institutions to mark the bombings’ first anniversary and curated the “Dear Boston” exhibit at the library.When I asked if she thought bringing some of these materials back into the public eye would make sense in the future, she had a nuanced response. Displaying some of the items in a comparative context could be valuable, Tisdale said — for example, alongside similar memorials created elsewhere in the United States, or with different items that capture Bostonians’ response to other traumas. That approach, she said, could yield insights about “how, as humans, we grapple with the things that knock us sideways.”But Tisdale also said resurfacing parts of the temporary memorial in isolation would have less meaning.“If we go back to 2013, 2014 ... if you asked Bostonians then how they wanted to memorialize this event in the immediate aftermath, many of them would have told you, ‘We want the biggest memorial you’ve got,’” she said. “And similarly, many would have said, ‘We need this collection’” — the items from the temporary memorial — “‘to be on display where we can all see it easily, forever.’”And yet, Tisdale added, “It’s natural for those feelings to fade with time. So here we are, 10 years later — and if you ask Bostonians what they need today, I expect many of them would tell you they’ve moved on. And that’s okay.”From that vantage point, the prospect of the temporary memorial abiding in the archives while being forgotten by the general public feels less like a problem to be solved than a victory, albeit a partial and painful one.Crilly, the Boston city archivist, says that interest among academic researchers may continue growing in the decades to come. “In my experience,” she said, “it can take a couple of decades before people start writing their books, start writing their academic articles.”In the meantime, she and her colleagues stand ready to assist anyone looking to activate their memories of a time that, for many of us, feels increasingly far away.“They're public records,” Crilly said. “People are always welcome to come in. And we have a lot of open appointments.”",Local,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 05:00:59 EST",818a68fa31800cddeb6faa0bcbf5d58e

Not only has the war in Ukraine set off a geopolitical realignment, but it has caused economic hardship far from the epicenter of the fighting.The Feb. 24, 2022, invasion has touched off a refugee crisis, as Ukrainians flee the conflict in their homeland and many Russian men seek to avoid conscription. Meanwhile, it has spurred a process toward expanding NATO, with Finland and Sweden pursuing membership after decades of official neutrality.Ukraine and Russia are key exporters of wheat, barley, corn and cooking oil, particularly to African and Middle Eastern countries. Turkey and the United Nations brokered a deal last summer to allow Ukrainian grain to pass through Black Sea ports, but Russia is reportedly still hindering shipments. Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer and petroleum. Disruptions to the flow of these goods are compounding other supply chain and climate challenges, driving up food and gas prices and causing shortages in places such as Chad, Tunisia and Sri Lanka.More than 8 million refugees have fled Ukraine in what the World Health Organization describes as ""the largest movement of people in the European Region since the Second World War."" Many have been involuntarily relocated by Russia. Others have put a strain on resources, as well as schools and hospitals, in Poland and Germany.A 21st century war in Europe — led by a nuclear power — is pushing the world toward realignment. It has rattled NATO, the European Union and the U.N., forcing countries to take sides in ways that have led to escalating tensions and diplomatic shifts. For example, Turkey, despite being a NATO member, has increased trade with Russia since the start of the war and has thrown up objections to allowing Sweden and Finland into the alliance.Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and fuel. European countries have banned the Russian oil, gas and diesel they relied on, which initially caused a steep spike in prices. However, moves by European nations to lock in alternative sources, along with conservation efforts and a mild winter, have largely alleviated those price hikes. Now prices have returned to pre-invasion levels.Russia has more nuclear weapons than any other country. Its attack on Ukraine has notably reenergized NATO, with the U.S. and other member states funneling tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment into Ukraine. Early weapons deliveries included anti-tank rockets such as the U.S.-made Javelin. In the latest moves, the U.S., Germany and Britain have promised to provide state-of-the-art tanks.NPR's Will Chase, Alex Leff, Pam Webster, Desiree Hicks and Nishant Dahiya contributed to this report.

3275,"The state always wins when it comes to gambling, critics say",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/09/the-state-always-wins-when-it-comes-to-gambling-critics-say,The Massachusetts State Lottery introduced a $50 scratch ticket this year to compete with online sports betting.,"The Massachusetts State Lottery currently offers more than 100 types of scratch cards. Those instant games brought in close to $4 million in revenue for the state in 2022, down 3% from the previous year. And this year, the lottery introduced a $50 scratch ticket to compete with online sports betting, promising players better odds and bigger prizes. The ticket’s debut led to record sales.But Les Bernal, the director of advocacy nonprofit Stop Predatory Gambling, told Greater Boston that the state shouldn't be in the business of gambling.“Citizens weren't demanding the opportunity to buy $50 scratch-off tickets in low-income communities,” Bernal said. A 2014 Social and Economic Impacts of Gambling in Massachusetts report found that 1.7% of Bay State citizens are problem gamblers. Of those, 77% are male, 24% are Black and 17% are unemployed. Rachel Volberg, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the principal investigator of the SEIGMA report, found that certain groups are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems. But she said the state can implement regulations to minimize and mitigate harm.“We are in the midst of one of the most explosive expansions of legalized gambling that the United States has seen in many, many years,” said Volberg. “So, you don't often hear about policymakers or anybody else really wanting to eliminate or reduce the number of gambling outlets.”Bernal said Massachusetts citizens lose more than $5,000 of their personal wealth every minute to the state’s lottery and regional casinos. ""This is driven by the greed of big gambling operators and a lust for political power by a handful of public officials,” said Bernal. “This is a business that's based on conning people. It's a form of consumer financial fraud, just like price gouging and false advertising. And that's why this business is illegal unless you partner with the state.”In the United States, gambling is regulated at the state level instead of being overseen by a federal agency. In Massachusetts, along with many other states, gambling has become normalized, which Bernal said is harmful.“Gambling used to be illegal, on the fringe of society,” said Bernal. “Today, it’s a government program with the MGM logo branded on the green monster at Fenway Park. You have a Massachusetts Lottery that sells Frosty the Snowman scratch off tickets during the holiday season.”Christian Teja, director of communications at the Mass Lottery, said in a statement that the lottery has operated in a transparent and responsible manner for more than 50 years.“The Lottery currently partners with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Office of Problem Gambling Services to raise awareness of problem gambling, train Lottery staff, and promote treatment and resources for those in need of assistance,” Teja added. But Bernal said Bay Staters are the real losers. “That's why they [government officials] spend tens of millions of dollars lobbying for you, the taxpayer. You're paying higher taxes for less services today because of government-sanctioned gambling,” said Bernal.",Local,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 12:56:52 EST",531170bb70a708ae66fd0d4dd5cd29f0
7255,Can people injured while skiing sue the ski resorts?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/28/can-people-injured-while-skiing-sue-the-ski-resorts,"The deck can be stacked in favor of the resorts, GBH's legal analyst said.","Skiing is one of the most exhilarating outdoor activities you can do in New England, but it's also one of the most dangerous. So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens? Daniel Medwed: So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain. Paris Alston: Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations? Medwed: Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident. Siegel: Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts. Medwed: Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts. Alston: So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you? Medwed: Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action. Siegel: But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident? Medwed: And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 — It's not a huge fine but you can get fined — if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that. Alston: So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope? Medwed: There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter. Did he consciously disregard the substantial risk of death when he engaged in that type of reckless behavior? So it happens. It's relatively rare, but there are criminal actions that derive from ski accidents occasionally.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:32:09 EST",ac774972f3c4092b4a88f7cfdcbd93cc

In her new one-woman show “Spring Affair,” she’s also a guide for audiences during turbulent current events.“Hopefully I can help people navigate through it in a funny, uplifting, upbeat way,” Bernhard said on Boston Public Radio on Thursday. The show reflects Bernhard’s nearly 50 years of performance by blending comedy, rock ’n’ roll, satire and social commentary. It will run at City Winery Boston on June 2.Bernhard weaves serious topics like abortion through her set. “It’s not easy to keep it comedic at this time,” she said. “But I manage to do it.”Bernhard began performing in 1975, but her career took off after starring in Martin Scorsese’s 1982 film “King of Comedy,” in which she played the stalker of comedian Jerry Lewis. Bernhard went on to have several one-woman shows, including the satire “Without You I’m Nothing,” which was turned into an HBO film in 1990. More recently she starred in “American Horror Story,” and played a nurse caring for AIDs patients in the FX drama “Pose,” which showcases the ballroom scene in 1980s New York City. Bernhard lived through that time and lost many friends to AIDs.“It was a very interesting, full-circle experience,” she said. Now, trans people and drag shows are at the crux of current culture wars. “It’s embarrassing,” Bernhard said. “It puts us behind lightyears where we had already come to.” Bernhard says her career, from her role in “Pose” to her latest show, all build on her past work. “It’s been a layer upon layer of things I’ve been proud of,” she said.",Local,"Thu, 25 May 2023 16:00:28 EST",8eba05769dd0008ebdd4382ed17873eb

""They are acting legislatively to restrict the teaching of inclusive history and marginalizing of people. All of us have to act and this advisory is prompting us to do so.”The NAACP advisory comes days after The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) issued a similar advisory in response to anti-immigrant laws imposing harsh penalties on those who aid undocumented immigrants. Equality Florida and ACLU of Florida have also issued warnings.This is only the second time in LULAC’s history the organization has issued this type of advisory, the first being in 2010 for Arizona after the state passed measures allowing law enforcement agents to demand “papers” from people who they suspect are not authorized to be in the U.S.President and CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens Domingo Garcia said those policies backfired in Arizona, resulting in the state turning from a red to a blue state, and he thinks the same could happen with Florida.“You see these things they’re doing, engaging in cultural wars against the gay community, against the African American community, against Latinos and against immigrants,"" Garcia said. ""Once we take that genie of hate out of the bottle, it’s real difficult to get it back in.”With DeSantis expected to join the 2024 presidential race next week, Curry said many of these measures are meant to appeal to his Republican voter base. “It’s a culture war and quite frankly all of the constituents we’ve been talking about are casualties of that war,” said Curry. “But Americans' attitudes have shifted since Donald Trump‘s election a few years ago. I’m hopeful that Ron DeSantis will have a rude awakening and we will no longer tolerate that kind of hate.”In the meantime, Garcia said people need to stay engaged. ""Don't get mad, but get organized,"" she said.

5572,Why more Pride parades are popping up in Massachusetts' small cities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/31/why-more-pride-parades-are-popping-up-in-massachusetts-small-cities,"Organizers want LGBTQ+ residents to feel at home in small towns and cities like Newburyport, not just major urban centers.","On a blindingly bright morning, Paul Goldberg looked up a main street in downtown Newburyport, pointing out the route he helped plan for the small city's first Pride parade. This Saturday, the inaugural event will step off from the old court house. “We’ll walk down Green Street to the end,” he said, turning to look north, “cross over to the waterfront there and walk along the boardwalk, just a short way into Waterfront Park.” Just over a year ago, it’s an event that would’ve been a distant dream in the city of less than 20,000. Last May, plans for a queer youth dance were thrown into chaos when the venue, a local Masonic lodge, abruptly pulled out less than two weeks before the event. The social organization’s statewide leadership had gone over members’ heads and called off the dance, seemingly over concerns about hosting an event for LGBTQ+ youth with a drag queen. But just as quickly, Newburyport’s community responded with a rush of support. Five venues offered up their spaces. Locals put together a welcoming wall of neighbors, where more than a hundred people showed up to wave flags, celebrate and stand in solidarity with the high schoolers. And the Masonic lodge went against orders: they hosted the dance anyway. It was a turning point for the city. Beyond Newburyport, organizers in small towns and cities across Massachusetts are making a concerted push for their queer neighbors feel seen and supported in their own communities, without having to go to the nearest big city. And it’s an effort that’s taken on additional meaning amid a national rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation in state legislatures. “After the ‘Over the Rainbow’ dance last May, we kind of reflected on everything that had happened — and the biggest takeaway was just this overwhelming outpouring of support from the community for our young people,” said Tarah MacGregor, who is now one of the Newburyport Pride board chairs. “We were like, ‘OK, Newburyport needs a Pride, right?’” she said. The nine-person committee in Newburyport, which had its first official meeting in December, is now putting the finishing touches on a dozen events, including a flag-raising with Gov. Maura Healey. “Every time somebody attacks our kids, it backfires ... because the community comes back with more love and more support than we could ever have imagined,” said James Giessler, who leads NAGLY, the North Shore Alliance of GLBT Youth. It co-sponsored last year’s dance. “As we see in Newburyport, with all the ruckus that they had, now they’re going to have one of the most spectacular Pride observations on the North Shore.” The Pride celebrations popping up in smaller cities and towns often take cues from the original marches, which were political protests in major cities that go back 50 years to commemorate the Stonewall riots. But today, these smaller Prides focus more on celebration, promoting visibility and making residents feel safe. Newburyport is far from Massachusetts’ first Pride outside of Boston; it’s not even the first Pride on the North Shore. Hope Watt-Bucci wanted to fight back against hate in her own community after she witnessed an older gay couple being mocked in a local restaurant and heard stories of homophobic taunts and assaults circulated on the North Shore. So, in 2012, she founded North Shore Pride and its first parade marched through Salem that June. Watt-Bucci remembered thinking she’d be glad if a hundred people came to the group’s first event. “Thousands of people showed up,” she recalled. “And I thought that, ‘OK, yeah, we need to do this. We clearly need to do this.’”Last year’s parade in Salem attracted 20,000 celebrants. Enough Pride celebrations have cropped up over the last decade that Watt-Bucci started what she calls the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together organizers from different North Shore celebrations. She and a dozen other organizers gathered on a recent Tuesday evening at a Beverly restaurant. It was a logistics-dominated evening, talking through event insurance, food trucks and 501c3 paperwork. But the room often burst into applause as organizers reveled in the dozens of events that would be held in cities and towns across the North Shore in June: drag queen bingo in Wenham, youth Pride in Lynn and a flurry of flag-raisings. This year, Topsfield is hosting Tri-town Pride for the second year with Boxford and Middleton — though it’s the first year they’ll have a parade — in response to a protest at a Boxford drag queen story hour last year. A formalized nonprofit is organizing Pride in Lynn for the first time. Revere will host its second annual “Beach Pride.” Wenham and Hamilton will have their third joint Pride picnic. Swampscott had its first Pride in 2020, and this year there’s a new addition: a “Run with Pride” 5k. Parades and other celebrations are often just “the tip of the iceberg” of deeper changes in the towns that are hosting them, according to Kim Creasap, who researches small-town Pride events in the Midwest. She’s found Ohio towns where organizers are celebrating the passage of a local ordinance, scaling up the reach of local support groups or hoping that a big celebration could be an economic boon. “There was actually a lot of advocacy behind the scenes leading up to Pride,” Creasap said, referencing those Midwestern cities and towns. “So, in other words, the Pride parades — or picnics, or festivals — were kind of a more visible consequence of a less visible community organizing that has been going on.” Joan Ilacqua leads The History Project, which preserves archives of New England’s LGBTQ+ history. She thinks part of the reason that more towns are hosting Prides is to fill the “vacuum” left by Boston Pride, which last hosted a parade in 2019, and that the increase in small-town and small-city Prides is the sign of a real shift. “People are feeling more comfortable being visible where they are, being in community with their neighbors,” Ilacqua said. “It kind of proves that you don't have to go away to the big city to be part of the queer community.”In Wenham, the third annual Pride flag raising is being organized by the city’s human rights committee. Martha Brennan, the chair, thought back to when the committee was first formed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, with the goal of making residents of all backgrounds feel more welcome in town. “One of the really endearing things that happened after our first flag raising was that a lesbian couple said it was the first time that they felt comfortable walking down the street holding hands because there’s not a lot of visibility,” Brennan recalled, referring to her town with 5,000 residents. “It’s a very small town and people are unsure of what others are thinking. And so it’s a nice way to signal that everybody’s welcome.” For Newburyport, this new chapter started with a difficult launching-off point, but one that many community members are glad to turn into a positive change for their city.The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in a written reply to GBH News, said it decided that it was not the right organization to hold the event, and that it would have been better suited for a school or public building. Last year, members of the Masonic lodge, which had initially canceled the queer youth dance on the organizers, ended up rebelling against the statewide organization.“The feeling was overwhelming, knowing that we were providing a safe space for them,” Michael Switzer, the former leader of the St. John’s Lodge, said when he thought back on that night last spring. “Knowing that even an ounce of that discrimination and pain that they felt came from our organization, we knew that we had to do the right thing.” It came with consequences. Many of the local Masons were reprimanded, suspended or expelled from the organization for their decision. But Switzer and others decided to form a new social club called the Wolfe Club that, this year, is sponsoring Newburyport Pride and is planning its own event to raise more funds for the Pride committee. “It’s really been fulfilling for us to come full circle,” Switzer said. “When you’re an ally and you make a sacrifice, it doesn’t have to be a sad, negative story. ... And it’s really been amazing to see what we’ve been able to accomplish in a year.” Seventeen-year-old Sully McLellan was one of the high schoolers at last year’s dance — one of at least 100 kids. “There was more food than we needed. We had, like, pints of ice cream that was donated that were never broken into,” he said. “It was just a really good experience. And the drag queen was really good, too.”This year, the youth dance will be held at City Hall. McLellan is taking the lead on organizing with a blacklight, outer-space theme. Members of the new Wolfe Club will be stationed outside, donning shirts that read “safety and support.” Hundreds of T-shirts and stickers are on their way for people and businesses around town to advertise their LGBTQ+ pride, and groups are readying to march their way down Green Street to the city’s waterfront on Saturday.For parade co-chair MacGregor, who grew up in a New Hampshire town just across the border from Newburyport, it’s coming full circle, too. “Growing up as a young queer person, I didn’t feel like I had community. And being able to be part of this volunteer mission, to create community where there is so much support and where young people can grow up and see these events happening and feel valued by their community?” she said. “That’s the goal.”",Local,"Wed, 31 May 2023 05:00:29 EST",cdbbfabf364193f3888c91adad2fa96c
867,It should be so much easier to cancel unwanted subscriptions,https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/04/03/it-should-be-so-much-easier-to-cancel-unwanted-subscriptions,A new FTC “click to cancel” proposal would make it as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe.,"Recently I spent the better part of two days in conversation with the fraud alert team at my bank. My debit card expired, and I was slow to update the information about the new card at all the various places where it’s registered. I knew the old card was expired; I had cut it up for extra security. I was merrily attempting to make my purchases online and in person using the new debit card with the new expiration date. But it was denied and kept being denied. Since the old card was designated as the default payment, I was racking up a bunch of bouncebacks — denials — on attempted purchases which triggered the fraud algorithms. Though I ended up in several rounds of time-consuming conversations, I appreciated the assertive vigilance of the fraud team’s multiple-step verification process. And it turns out that being forced to navigate the process proved to be revealing in another way.Reviewing the attempted charges with the fraud team, I discovered most of the denied purchases were subscriptions.

The fraud alerts shut down the automatic billings until I could verify the charges giving me a fresh look at my weekly, monthly, bi-monthly and yearly subscriptions. Many of these subscriptions I had forgotten about or were impulse purchases that didn’t make any sense beyond the moment. Seriously, why do I have a subscription for a weekly specialty drink, when I rarely sip anything but water and coffee? Because in order to sample ONE of the specialty sips, I had to sign up for the free trial. I got distracted, missed the end of the free trial and here I am months later paying regularly for that singular sip. I haven’t even been back to the store to sample another!

The Commission’s recent proposal would require businesses to alert consumers that their subscriptions are about to renew, and to stop companies from making special offers coupled with high pressure tactics to make you keep the subscription. The so-called “click to cancel” proposal would make it as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe. The agency is soliciting public comment on the proposal.

5872,Some housing activists disappointed with Healey's choice for housing secretary,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/16/some-housing-activists-disappointed-with-healeys-choice-for-housing-secretary,"The appointee, Ed Augustus, served as Worcester city manager from 2014 to 2022.","Some Massachusetts housing activists say they’re disappointed with Gov. Maura Healey’s appointment of Ed Augustus, who will serve as the state’s first housing secretary in 30 years. Healey revived the position to help address Massachusetts’ spiraling housing crisis. In a statement Monday announcing Augustus’ appointment as leader of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, she credited him with overseeing the development of various new housing complexes while he was Worcester’s city manager from 2014 to 2022. “He left Worcester a stronger city than it was a decade ago, with booming economic development in the downtown and thousands of new housing units,” Healey said. But housing activists in Worcester argue that’s misleading, noting the vast majority of those new apartments have been too expensive for low- to moderate-income renters. They add that housing prices in Worcester soared and homelessness rose to record highs while Augustus ran the city. Today, a year after Augustus stepped down as city manager, nearly 50% of Worcester renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on rent and utilities. Longtime residents are increasingly leaving Worcester because they can no longer find affordable housing in the city. “He was the city manager, the CEO of the city, at a time where his role [was] to organize and oversee the current wave of gentrification that is not benefiting — and is in fact harming and pushing out — the most vulnerable segments of the population,” said Addison Turner, who advocates for homeless people in Worcester. Other Massachusetts housing advocates have applauded Augustus’ appointment, arguing his experience with housing at the local level could prove valuable. “Congratulations, Secretary Augustus!” Rachel Heller, CEO of the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, said in a tweet. “Your experiences in local and state government are vital for developing policies and supports to produce the homes that people, our communities, and the Commonwealth need in order to thrive!”By some estimates, the commonwealth will need as many as 200,000 new residential units by 2030 to address its housing crunch. Building those apartments and houses will involve convincing localities to re-zone for more multifamily housing, a delicate effort that Augustus will lead as housing secretary.Still, activists who specialize in affordable housing say Healey’s choice raises questions about her administration’s housing priorities. Andrea Park, an attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, said state leaders need to focus on creating housing for the lowest-income families, rather than housing in general. “How are we going to create permanent affordability?” Park said. “That includes moving people out of homelessness, out of shelter. So we would put that challenge forth to the new secretary and hope to work with him to really address the crisis.”",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 16:53:28 EST",90ee87aa0c7186b2d6b18fc5d8e2f77e

Would adding more justices help?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/04/28/trust-in-the-us-supreme-court-is-dropping-would-adding-more-justices-help,A national campaign for expansion kicked off in Boston this week with some big names from Massachusetts politics.,"Public views of the U.S. Supreme Court are currently as negative as they’ve been in more than three decades, and Democratic voters in particular are losing faith in the institution. A series of controversial recent decisions, including the reversal of Roe v. Wade, seem to be driving this crisis of confidence, along with troubling revelations about ethical entanglements involving Justice Clarence Thomas.This week, Just Majority, a coalition of left-leaning groups deeply dissatisfied with the court, came to Boston to launch a national campaign aimed at expanding the court, and enlisted U.S. Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to help make its case. But would expanding the court make its rulings more congruent with public opinion? Should that even be the goal? And if not, what other steps might improve the court’s performance and shore up ebbing public trust? Adam Reilly is joined by Renée Landers, a professor of law at Suffolk University and a past president of the Boston Bar Association, and Paul Collins, a political scientist and Supreme Court expert at UMass Amherst, to discuss the state of the court today and reforms that could boost public confidence moving forward.

In 2019, Franklin's niece found three handwritten documents around the singer's home in suburban Detroit. One, dated 2014, was found underneath a couch cushion.Two of Franklin's sons, Kecalf and Edward Franklin, argued through their lawyers that they wanted the latter note to override a separate will written in 2010. The opposing party was their brother, Ted White II, whose lawyer argued that the 2010 will should stand because it was found under lock and key in Aretha Franklin's home. The most recent will stipulates that Kecalf as well as Aretha Franklin's grandchildren would be entitled to her home in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The 2010 will says her sons would need to get a certificate or degree in business before becoming entitled to her estate, but it does not say that in the 2014 version, according to the AP. Both versions of the will allow her four sons to benefit from music royalties and copyrights. Aretha Franklin's fourth son, Clarence Franklin, lives in an assisted living facility and was not present at the trial, the AP reported. Though many of the documents were hard to read at times, the jury concluded that the 2014 note had her name signed at the bottom, with a smiley face written inside the letter ""A,"" the AP said.Franklin, crowned the ""Queen of Soul"" for hits such as ""Respect,"" ""Chain of Fools"" and ""Day Dreaming,"" died in 2018 at age 76 from pancreatic cancer.

430,Supporters of sex ed bill say it's time for Massachusetts to act,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/30/supporters-of-sex-ed-bill-say-its-time-for-massachusetts-to-act,"The bill would set guidelines for medically accurate, LGBTQ-inclusive sex education.","Supporters of a comprehensive sex education bill known as the Healthy Youth Act have been pushing for its passage on Beacon Hill for a dozen years. That means, Healthy Youth Coalition chair Jaclyn Friedman said Tuesday, that a full generation of students have cycled through Massachusetts schools since the bill was first introduced. “That’s an entire generation that’s been exposed to the sometimes hateful, sometimes just clueless whims of school districts and principals and individual teachers — an entire generation that has basically, at random, missed out on the incredible benefits of sex education,” Friedman said at a State House lobby day. Advocates, including some current students, visited lawmakers to make the case for the bill. Versions of it have passed the state Senate four times, while House leaders have never brought it to the floor for a vote. “I’m sick and tired of getting up at a podium every two years and talking about a commonsense bill that we can’t get across the finish line,” Sen. Sal DiDomenico, the bill’s lead Senate sponsor, said. “I’m tired of talking to all of you and telling you how important this bill is, and not being able to get this done.” The bill does not mandate that Massachusetts schools offer sexual health education, but it would require that schools offering such instruction ""provide a medically accurate, age-appropriate, comprehensive sexual health education."" Under the bill, that curriculum would include information on human anatomy, reproduction and sexual development, ""the benefits of abstinence and delaying sexual activity,"" prevention of both dating violence and sexually transmitted infections, relationship and communication skills, and age-appropriate information about gender identity and sexual identity, ""including affirmative education that people have different sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.""Schools teaching sexual education would need to adopt a written policy ensuring parents or legal guardians are notified about the courses and their ability to withdraw a student from all or part of the instruction. Over the years, some lawmakers have been wary of wading into issues around sex and sexuality, and some critics have said decisions are better left to parents and local communities than the state. But as states around the country pursue new restrictions on abortion and LGBTQ rights, supporters of the Healthy Youth Act say the time is right for Massachusetts to act on sex education. They also see a potential ally in Gov. Maura Healey, whose campaign platform last year featured a pledge to back “comprehensive, LGBTQ-inclusive, consent-focused, and medically accurate sex education.” Jennifer Hart of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said her organization conducted a national analysis of state sex education policies, awarding Massachusetts the neutral score of zero. Fourteen states ranked higher, she said, including some with more restrictive laws around abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. ""Young people across the country witness their rights and access to care and education eroding before their eyes,"" Hart said. ""Passing the Healthy Youth Act is one way we can step up right now to ensure that our youth today, tomorrow and in the future have the access and the means to make the best decisions for their own health and safety.""The House and Senate versions of the Healthy Youth Act are before the Legislature’s Education Committee, which has not yet scheduled them for a hearing.",Politics,"Tue, 30 May 2023 16:16:12 EST",9dde936a1f20771536c80dd4864d62f4

But the movement has been getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.Tensions within the community were visible at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday as a noisy hearing culminated with a 6-1 vote with a majority of the council agreeing that caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.The packed room, which overflowed with activists from both sides bearing banners, chanting slogans, challenging speakers and city officials as they made their comments, laid bare stark divisions over this issue within the South Asian diaspora. A majority of those present in council chambers were supporters of the ordinance and those opposed were a vocal minority.As council members voted in favor of the ordinance, the chamber erupted into cheers of ""Jai Bhim,"" which means ""victory for Bhim"" a rallying cry adopted by followers of B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian Dalit rights icon whose given name was Bhimrao. Dalit groups and their supporters say caste discrimination is prevalent in U.S. diaspora communities, manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.Yogesh Mane, a Seattle resident who grew up as an untouchable in India, broke into tears as he heard the council's decision.""I'm emotional because this is the first time such an ordinance has been passed anywhere in the world outside of South Asia,"" he said. ""It's a historic moment.""Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, whose advocacy work along with community partners continues to push caste discrimination laws forward, called the council vote ""a culture war that has been won.""""We got the support of over 200 organizations from Seattle and around the country,"" she said. ""It's a powerful message that Dalit people are not alone. The South Asian community has united to say we want to heal from the trauma of caste.""Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. Sawant said the council received over 4,000 emails in support of the ordinance.""We've heard hundreds of gut-wrenching stories over the last few weeks showing us that caste discrimination is very real in Seattle,"" she said.Council Member Sara Nelson who cast the lone dissenting vote agreed with opponents calling the ordinance ""a reckless, harmful solution to a problem for which we have no data or research.""""This could generate more anti-Hindu discrimination and could dissuade employers from hiring South Asians,"" she said. ""The community that is being impacted is deeply divided on this issue.""Nelson also said the ordinance would also get the city entangled in legal battles to which Sawant responded: ""Bring it on."" Sawant said being fearful of lawsuits is not the way to effect progress or change.Council Member Lisa Herbold questioned opponents' logic that the law singles out Hindus and people of Indian descent.""That's like saying gender discrimination laws single out all men,"" she said. ""And just because we have a small population that is experiencing (caste discrimination) that doesn't make it any less important.""Shobha Swamy, a representative of the Coalition of Hindus of North America said she was disappointed by the council deliberations and line of questioning. The group said they received a show of support from over 100 organizations.""Due diligence wasn't done,"" said Swami, who flew in from Atlanta.C.H. Srikrishna, a San Francisco Bay Area-based tech worker, said he is worried about the ramifications this ordinance might have for the South Asian community.""I too want discrimination to end,"" he said. ""But we need to first determine that widespread discrimination exists.""Srikrishna, who is Hindu, believes the ordinance does target his religion.""When you say it originated 2,000 years ago, that is implicitly blaming Hinduism,"" he said. ""That bothers me. I feel betrayed.""Sanjay Patel, a tech company owner from the Seattle area, said he never felt discriminated against in the U.S. as a member of a lower caste and that the ordinance pained him because it reminded him of a caste identity, which he thought had become obsolete.""I fear with this law, businesses will be afraid to hire South Asians,"" he said.Earlier Tuesday morning, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting where more than 300 people had requested to speak virtually and in person. They heard about half of the comments before moving on to deliberations and the vote.The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one's occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid — known as Dalits — has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation's independence from British rule.The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination.In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.

3470,Huntington's spreads like 'fire in the brain.' Scientists say they've found the spark,https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2023/06/19/huntingtons-spreads-like-fire-in-the-brain-scientists-say-theyve-found-the-spark,Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's spread through the brain like a forest fire. A new study suggests how the fire starts.,"Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's are caused by toxic clumps of proteins that spread through the brain like a forest fire. Now scientists say they've figured out how the fire starts in at least one of these diseases. They've also shown how it can be extinguished.The finding involves Huntington's disease, a rare, inherited brain disorder that cut short the life of songwriter Woody Guthrie. But the study has implications for other degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's.It ""opens the path"" to finding the initial event that leads to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, says Corinne Lasmézas, who studies neurodegenerative diseases at the Wertheim UF Scripps Institute in Jupiter, Florida. She was not involved in the study.People with Huntington's ""begin to lose control of their body movements, they have mental impediments over time, and eventually they die,"" says Randal Halfmann, an author of the study and a researcher at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo.Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington's occurs when proteins in the brain fold into an abnormal shape and begin to stick together. Then these clumps of abnormal protein begin to cause nearby proteins to misfold and clump too.""As the disease progresses you're effectively watching a sort of a forest fire,"" Halfmann says. ""And you're trying to figure out what started it.""In essence, Halfmann's team wanted to find the molecular matchstick responsible for the lethal blaze. To do that, they needed to chronicle an event that is fleeting and usually invisible. It's called nucleation, the moment when a misfolded protein begins to aggregate and proliferate.The team developed a way to conduct experiments inside individual cells. They used genetic tweaks to create hundreds of versions of a protein segment called PolyQ, which becomes toxic in Huntington's. The team placed different versions of PolyQ in a cell, then look for signs of misfolding and clumping.""It's sort of like if you're in a dark room and you're trying to figure out what the shape of the room is,"" Halfmann says. ""You just keep bumping into things and eventually you bump into things enough times to figure out exactly what it looks like.""The trial-and-error approach worked, Halfmann says. ""What starts this little forest fire in the brain is a single molecule of PolyQ.""Once the team had identified that molecule, they were able to find a way to prevent it from spreading — at least in the lab. The trick was to flood the cell with proteins that, in effect, smothered the flame before it could do any damage. The next step will be to develop a drug that can do something similar in people, Halfmann says.""Ultimately, it only matters if we actually create a therapy,"" he says. ""Otherwise, it's just academics.""The study could also lead to new treatments for other neurodegenerative diseases, Lasmézas says, treatments that prevent the cascade of events that leads to brain damage. ""You have to go back when the fire starts, so that it doesn't propagate in the entire forest,"" she says.The Alzheimer's field appears to be learning that lesson. Early drugs targeted the large amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with the disease. But these drugs didn't work, perhaps because the plaques they sought to eliminate are just the charred remains of a forest that has already burned.Lasmézas says the latest drugs, like lecanemab, still remove large clumps of amyloid, ""but they also recognize the ones that are smaller and that are more toxic. And this is why they block more efficiently, the neuronal toxicity.""These smaller clumps form before plaques appear, and are closer to the event that touches off Alzheimer's in the first place, Lasmézas says.Studies like the one on Huntington's show that scientists are finally closing in on strategies that will slow or halt diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, Lasmézas says.""For a long time, we didn't know much about the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases,"" she says. ""Within the last, let's say, 15 years, there's been literally an explosion of knowledge.""

Smoke from Canadian wildfires has plagued parts of the Northeast for a few weeks but got especially concentrated in the past several days. An upper level, low pressure system pushed the smoke from Eastern Canada to the south and west, leading New York City to have some of the worst air quality in the country. You can see on the satellite loop below how the swirl in the atmosphere is circulating in a counterclockwise direction. As the smoke rises and gets caught up in this flow, it moves with it. This is why the air over Maine has been of higher quality than the air over New York. The smoke gets caught and moves south. If the low were in a different position, then the trajectory of the smoke would also move.You can see from the air quality index below that the worst air quality is actually over western New England, and it gets even poorer as you head further south. This is likely going to be the trend over the next few days, with the Mid-Atlantic seeing the worst of the smoke.As we head into the weekend, the weather looks a bit mixed to start but should improve for Sunday. Temperatures will be in the 60s on Friday and 65 to 70 on Saturday, with rain possible both days. If you're headed to any of the LGBTQ+ Pride events over the weekend, the best chance for showers will be Friday afternoon. Saturday afternoon showers will be much more limited, if they occur at all.

She rests her speckled gray head on the rock and patiently waits for fish.Passers-by outside the New England Aquarium have long been able to see Trumpet and her children, Cayenne and Chacoda, from afar. But now, a lucky few visitors can get up close and personal with the aquarium’s seals: sitting in their exhibit, watching them feed and even feeling their whiskers on their hands. “It's just an amazing opportunity to meet these animals up close and personal,” said Patricia Leonard, assistant curator of marine mammals. “And it's just a fun opportunity for trainers as well to show off the joy of working with the harbor seals.”The aquarium offers two kinds of meet-and-greets, each just once a day for a group of up to four people: An encounter with the seals for $150 for non-members, in which trainers will bring the group into their exhibit and demonstrate feeding, training and tricks; And an artistic encounter for $225 for non-members, in which visitors can see seals create a small painting with a paintbrush mounted onto a block the seals bite down on. The aquarium sees it as an opportunity to engage people, and especially children, in environmental work, Leonard said. “For me, it's important for a number of different reasons. One, kids are basically our future, obviously,"" she said. ""And so they are our opportunity to change what's happening in the planet and being able to help them understand the impact that they can have on the ocean environment is huge. And these harbor seals are here to help us make that connection.”It also allows trainers to show off their work: Trumpet’s father was known as Hoover the talking seal, since he learned to mimic human speech. Hoover’s grandson, Chacoda, has picked up on the habit: On command, he can vocalize what sounds like “How are you?” — a trick his trainers reward with fish and praise. “When he made a sound that sounded almost like a human word, we would reinforce that,” Leonard said. “And then we were more likely to hear that again in the future.”The New England Aquarium is offering meet-and-greet slots though April and May. They plan to pause them through seal molting season, which usually begins around June.",Local,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:32:47 EST",ca9aaf195ab3f8a7d10a9d397ffabae2

When is the marathon? How long has it taken place?This year’s Boston Marathon is on Monday, April 17, 2023.The Boston Marathon is the oldest continually run marathon in the world, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year. This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots’ Day — the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots’ Day. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects for One Boston Day.What is the marathon route?The 26.2-mile route starts in Hopkinton and makes its way through suburbs, all the way to the finish line in Boston. Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners. After setting off along East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle and takes Beacon Street into Brookline, then through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square. How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating a certain time at another major marathon, a time that’s determined by their gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don’t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September. The other way to run the marathon is as part of the charity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who’s running the Boston Marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the “fastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.” The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men’s side are: Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who’s taking on Boston for the first time after winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men’s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women’s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia’s Atsede Baysa. The women’s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland’s Manuela Schär, who has won Boston four times; Australia’s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times. The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year. How much money do athletes win?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made this year?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes. ""So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,"" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the “The Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,” told GBH News when the policy was announced in September. ""I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work … this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.""In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allow pregnant and postpartum runners who qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. “Women who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,” said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA. Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively.Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. If you’re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square.If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. For more details on watching in person, check out the BAA’s spectator guide.What other events will be happening that weekend? The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay. April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m.",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 05:00:10 EST",97792f7e96212ea7be5a9bead7c158fe

That’s when a series of collisions, derailments and fires prompted a rare federal investigation into the operation of the agency's subway system.In a statement announcing the audit, DiZoglio said it will focus on “safety risk management and overall areas of improvement,” and she plans to share the findings with Gov. Maura Healey, the state Legislature and the general public. But Brian Kane, the executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, questioned the need for a state audit at this time.“What the T doesn't need right now is more people coming in and telling them what they're not doing,"" Kane told GBH News. ""What they need is people coming in and helping them to do the things they need to do.”Kane said officials already know the T is not performing well.""The reasons for that are very well documented: it's personnel and it's money,"" he said. ""In a lot of cases, it's not a surprise.”In her announcement, DiZoglio said the interest of taxpayers underscored the need for an audit. “Safety issue after issue has arisen and the taxpayers continue to be on the hook,"" she said. ""Taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent.” That appears to be at odds with a Feb. 15 letter sent to state Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca, in which DiZoglio's office described the probe as a “performance audit” and not a financial one. There is a line that provides more detail about the specific scope of the audit, but most it has been redacted. It starts: “Our audit … will include but not be limited to” with the rest of the sentence blacked out. In response to questions from GBH News, a spokesperson for the auditor’s office said that the scope of audits are sometimes redacted to protect their integrity, and that a performance audit can include finances.MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo told GBH News: “We have received this communication and will be cooperating with the state auditor’s office.”",Local,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 14:24:40 EST",e0c89acff4f27489762d7f124b73743c

6822,Rolling rally highlights push for Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/11/rolling-rally-highlights-push-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers-to-unionize,The question over how tech companies should interact with gig workers has been looming for years on Beacon Hill.,"Honking their horns and cheering as they circled the State House in a caravan, Uber and Lyft drivers rallied with labor groups and other advocates Tuesday to again press Massachusetts lawmakers to pass a bill that would let the drivers unionize and offer other worker protections.Bill supporters say that a union would help drivers negotiate for better pay, benefits and working conditions. It’s a push that’s gone on for more than two years on Beacon Hill, with a union just one of a handful ideas raised by competing groups in the fight over how to legally treat rideshare drivers’ employment. Organizers said more than 500 people participated in Tuesday's event, gathering at a Dorchester parking lot before driving to the State House. Uber driver Betania Gonell said she’s been using the platform for seven years, usually working 60 to 70 hours a week. She said she used to be able to work fewer hours and earn the same amount of money. ""That is frustrating for me because I took this career just to take care of my kids and have time and flexibility for them, but now I don't have even that,” Gonnell said. Gonnell is affiliated with the Drivers Demand Justice Coalition, a group whose members include Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, the International Association of Machinists, the Chinese Progressive Association, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, the Merrimack Valley Project, the Union of Minority Neighborhoods and Latinos Unidos in Massachusetts. That coalition backs the unionization bill, filed in the House by Lawrence Rep. Frank Moran and in the Senate by Sen. Jason Lewis of Winchester and Sen. Liz Miranda of Dorchester. The bill also would guarantee a minimum pay rate and protections like paid sick leave and workers’ compensation. Miranda and Lewis said rideshare drivers deserve the same collective bargaining rights as all other workers in Massachusetts. “It’s time that Uber and Lyft — huge, profitable companies that are exploiting their workforce — are held to account,” Lewis said. Massachusetts policymakers have been trying to get a handle for years on what the relationship should be between platforms like Uber and Lyft and the gig-economy drivers, with labor advocates and the tech giants on different sides of the issue.In 2020, then-Attorney General Maura Healey filed a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft, alleging that the companies were denying drivers protections like a minimum wage by improperly classifying them as independent contractors rather than employees. That suit is still pending. Voters almost had a chance to settle the matter of driver classification last year, when a group supported by rideshare and food delivery companies sought to put a question on the ballot that would have written into state law that the drivers are contractors. The Supreme Judicial Court ultimately struck that question from the ballot, leaving the issue unresolved as a new legislative session started this year. The industry-backed group Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, which has also rallied drivers at the State House this year, says many drivers prefer the independence that comes with contractor status. The group favors one bill that would establish drivers as independent contractors while also providing some new benefits, and another that would create company-funded “portable benefit accounts” for drivers.Conor Yunits, spokesman for the Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, said in a statement to GBH News that unionization bill “would force drivers to become employees for all intents and purposes,” and that his group will “continue to encourage the legislature to bring all parties to the table to find a compromise that protects the independence that drivers demand and the benefits they deserve.”Other bills on Beacon Hill also propose different strategies for addressing the pay, benefits and classification of gig economy drivers. Lawmakers on a pair of committees, the Financial Services Committee and the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, will hold hearings at some point in the two-year session to explore the issues.",Politics,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 18:03:46 EST",8f4c06216e5b483242d4f17dfc4dbd3d
6793,Massachusetts allocates nearly $2M to organizations helping immigrants and refugees,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/01/massachusetts-allocates-nearly-2m-to-organizations-helping-immigrants-and-refugees,State officials say the funds will help meet the needs of nearly 800 recently arrived refugee and immigrant families.,"Seventeen service providers in Massachusetts will be receiving $1.75 million in public funds to help meet the needs of nearly 800 recently arrived refugee and immigrant families, state officials said Thursday.The Healey-Driscoll administration and the nonprofit Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition announced the influx of cash will go to organizations assisting with case management and legal aid for an increasing number of migrants fleeing economic strain and political violence in countries like Haiti, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil. “Service providers in Massachusetts have been going above and beyond in recent months to connect migrant families arriving in our state with the resources and support they need,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a written statement. “Our administration is proud to partner with the MIRA Coalition on the newly created Immigrant Assistance Services program and to provide additional funding to these organizations to support the important work they do for our communities.” The MIRA Coalition, New England’s largest immigrant rights nonprofit, will soon sub-grant out the funding to other organizations. Beneficiaries include the International Institute of New England, the Brazilian Workers Center, Boston Health Care for the Homeless, Jewish Family Service of Western Massachusetts, La Colaborativa in Chelsea and the Justice Center of Southeast Massachusetts.Liz Sweet, executive director of the MIRA Coalition, told GBH News that the funding will help families currently eligible for state emergency shelter enroll in benefits, schools and child care programs. “We’re really looking forward to seeing these organizations receive funding for work that they often have been doing, but sometimes with really minimal resources,” she said. “Housing certainly is a real challenge here in Massachusetts.""The International Institute of New England says it will be providing training and support around case management.“What the Institute is doing specifically is creating and training other providers on best practices in case management and building out a database and data system for all of the providers,” said Alexandra Weber, a senior vice president for the organization. She said they hope this will help organizations track and keep better records related to immigrant needs and what is provided.Some providers told GBH News that the state funding is appreciated — but not nearly enough to meet the need. The Immigrant Family Services Institute, based in Mattapan, is receiving almost $65,000 to aid its efforts in helping Haitian migrants. But Executive Director Geralde Gabeau says this money is only a “drop in the ocean” for the thousands of immigrants they seek to help each month.“Being the organization serving the largest Haitian group of new immigrants and having five different offices across the state, $64,000 is not even one week’s worth of payroll for us,” she said.Gabeau says her organization has what it calls a “one-stop-shop” for helping parents enroll their children in school, take English and computer classes, and find employment, housing, and work authorization. Gabeau estimates helping each person costs the organization at least $1,200. In May alone, she said, the organization assisted 4,000 Haitians arriving in Massachusetts, some from the border with humanitarian parole, seeking asylum, as well as people coming from other states. Many Haitians have recently found shelter in the emergency room lobby of Boston Medical Center, and rely on a network of nonprofits to create piecemeal temporary housing. The Department of Housing and Community Development is continuing to expand the number of hotels it makes available for unhoused families, including the addition of a Salem State University dorm complex.",Local,"Thu, 01 Jun 2023 15:51:51 EST",437a86ad53127ae52de1b054219f2491

Kraft will get a chance to see the impact the World Cup will have on the world when Gillette Stadium hosts games in 2026. And on Thursday, for the first time, Boston unveiled its official branding for the 2026 World Cup as it continues to prepare to take part in one of the world’s biggest sporting events. Local and state officials were on hand at Big Night Live on Causeway Street for the unveil party. Speaking at the event, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu pointed to the city's international spirit.""So it only makes sense that for the fourth time, the world's game will return to the city of the world,” she said. “We've opened our doors to our neighbors across the globe for more than 400 years here in Boston. And we can't wait to do it again in 2026 for fan fests, celebrations and viewings throughout our neighborhoods. We can't wait to welcome you to our incredible city.""There’s no word yet on how many games Gillette Stadium will host; the schedule for 2026 is expected to be released later this year. Boston will know which teams will play at Gillette at the final draw, which is set to take place a few months before the Cup. Regardless who ends up playing here, the impact the World Cup will have on the area is expected to be massive. Organizers say an economic impact of up to $500 million could be coming Boston’s way from the games at Gillette Stadium. Brian Bilello, president of the New England Revolution, said that each host city will get six and a half matches on average — but he’s hoping for more. He pointed out that the Boston area has several communities that would come out to support the countries that could end up playing at Gillette. ""For me, the U.S. would be great. I mean, to have the home team here, there's nothing like it,"" Bilello said. ""We have a great Brazilian population, we've had some amazing events with Brazil at our stadium in the past. My family's all Italian, so for me, I would love to see Italy. But we have a vibrant Colombian community, we have a vibrant Haitian community if Haiti qualifies. ... You name the country, and we have a great community to support it here in Boston.""",Local,"Thu, 18 May 2023 17:58:36 EST",81e95a24e25b5fc6c52fb54fa29e7fee

Fearing another major blow to abortion access, some providers are already considering alternatives.","A federal judge in Texas could rule as soon as today on whether to cut off access to a key medication abortion protocol, giving lawyers until day's end to submit additional arguments. Fearing another major blow to abortion access, some providers are already considering alternatives.At the Trust Women clinic in Wichita, Kansas, it's already been crisis mode for months. And now clinic Director Ashley Brink says the staff is bracing for another — maybe even bigger — wave of uncertainty.""We're at an unprecedented time,"" Brink says. ""We've never faced this kind of crisis, and so there is a lot of unknowns.""First, they got patients from Texas after that state's abortion ban took effect in 2021. Then, patients came from all over the region after last summer's landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision. And now, they're facing the possibility of a nationwide ruling that would block access to a common abortion pill.An(other) unprecedented momentIn states where abortion is still legal, providers know they could soon lose the ability to prescribe the abortion drug mifepristone. A coalition of anti-abortion-rights groups, arguing that the drug was improperly approved, is asking the federal judge appointed by President Trump to overturn that approval. Under the current two-drug protocol, the patient first takes mifepristone, which works by blocking progesterone, a hormone that helps a pregnancy progress. The second drug, misoprostol, then causes contractions to bring on what's essentially a medically induced miscarriage.If the judge overturns the approval of that protocol, Brink says the Wichita clinic will only be able to offer patients either a surgical abortion or misoprostol alone. For now, that means preparing the staff with extra training on how to communicate to patients about the impact of the new protocol if they're forced to make the change.""Because it is a different procedure than using the two-medication regimen with mifepristone,"" Brink says, ""we're having to make sure everyone has the right language and the right information to ensure that they're communicating that effectively.""Downsides and unknownsA recent study by the Guttmacher Institute found that 98% of medication abortions in the U.S. used the two-drug protocol in 2020. But internationally, the second drug, misoprostol, has been used alone for decades, says Dr. Jamila Perritt, president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health. Perritt says the case could leave both healthcare providers and patients facing complex medical and legal decisions about how to move forward without mifepristone.""At this point, there are still a lot of unknowns in terms of how this is going to play out,"" Perritt says. ""What we do know is that misoprostol has been used on its own for decades around the world and is effective at ending an early pregnancy.""The World Health Organization says misoprostol can be used effectively alone, often with additional doses. There are downsides, though, including a higher risk of side effects like nausea and cramping, says Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a public health professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who is researching the misoprostol-only protocol. ""It's so important that patients understand how long they'll be bleeding after they take the miso alone,"" she says. ""And it is longer.""A learning curveMost available research also suggests using only misoprostol is somewhat less effective than when it is combined with mifepristone. Upadhyay says removing mifepristone from the equation will mean difficult decisions for doctors and patients, particularly those traveling from states where abortion is illegal: ""I think it's going to be a huge learning curve for clinicians to figure out — what's the best, right protocol for this patient? How should I counsel this specific patient based on their legal risks and based on how far they traveled to get here?""But for patients who don't want to undergo a surgical procedure, misoprostol alone may become the option of choice. An uncertain legal landscapeAbortion rights opponents are quick to point out that misoprostol is currently approved for use as an ulcer drug — not as a standalone medication to induce abortion.""Misoprostol alone would not be an FDA-approved use of that drug for chemical abortion,"" says Julie Blake, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the anti-abortion groups in the lawsuit challenging mifepristone's approval. ""Using drugs that were approved for other purposes off-label certainly carries additional dangers and safety risks.""But off-label doesn't necessarily mean illegal. The current lawsuit doesn't directly address off-label uses. Perritt of Physicians for Reproductive Health says misoprostol is already widely — and safely — used off-label for miscarriage management, in procedures like IUD insertion and for abortion. But she worries about an increasingly murky legal landscape surrounding abortion pills.""If they're coming for mifepristone, believe me, they're coming for misoprostol. It will not end with the one medication,"" Perritt says. ""And so all of this is at risk."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 05:00:00 EST",39be2ab3a658e899d7bf22bc1a57ae07

They're hosting an informal but semi-regular support group at their home in suburban Rancho Cordova east of Sacramento.""Yeah, she loves having family dinners. Sunday is family dinner day now,"" says Elizabeth Kaino Hopper as she and husband, Marvin, show a recent picture of their 37-year-old daughter, Christine. This ordinary lunch with friends is also a vital one: Every parent here has an adult child with a severe mental illness; a son or daughter who's also struggled with homelessness, substance abuse and arrests. The gatherings give them the chance to share stories, strategies and challenges of having a child with a serious and untreated mental disorder.""That's pretty much what he looks like now,"" says Diana Burdick as she shows the others a phone shot of her son, Michael, 49, who has lived on the streets for a nearly a decade. ""Aww, see, anybody looking at him would say, he's not right, he doesn't feel good,"" Elizabeth Hopper says, shaking her head in between lunch bites.Eight California counties are going first in a planned statewide, controversial experiment to try to fix a seemingly intractable problem every parent around the table is grappling with: How to get treatment and support for loved ones with serious mental health challenges, mostly schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.Some of these people end up cycling in and out of police holds, jails, emergency rooms and homeless shelters and encampments. The nationwide problem is particularly acute in California, which accounts for nearly one third of all people in the United States experiencing homelessness.Some cities including Los Angeles estimate that 10% to 17% of individuals who are unsheltered have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. But the fact that so many go without a formal diagnosis, experts say the true percentage is likely far higher. Diana Burdick's son used to play guitar in a band, loved to draw pen and ink landscapes and worked for a time as an electrician's apprentice, his mom says. But for years now, Burdick says, Michael has been wracked by delusions and paranoia and frequently self-medicates with narcotics, mostly methamphetamine.He doesn't want any help, she says, because Michael refuses to think of himself as ill at all. ""In fact, he thinks that he owns IKEA, and that I have a trust fund with Bill Clinton and that should be giving him monthly checks, and that's why he refuses to get care because he doesn't think that anything's wrong with him.""He wanders the city during the day and sleeps outside, she's not sure where. Several days a week, however, she drops off food and sometimes clothes for him at a store near her home that's run by a friend.But she rarely stays to talk with her son. He often gets agitated, she says, and the conversation goes nowhere. A few times over the years he's gotten violent. One incident resulted in a restraining order after an attack sent her to the emergency room.""In one of his psychotic stages hit me in the face and required 14 stitches. His psychosis at the time is that I caused hurricane Katrina. I'm very powerful,"" she says with a pained smile.""We're just kind of waiting for him to get arrested – again - for something"" she says, that might push him into care. An arrest for arson resulted in no mental health treatment because her son has never been formally diagnosed and police had no record of mental health issues. As Michael's step-dad, Lorrin Burdick, puts it, unless they can apply some pressure on him, he's very likely to stay on the streets mentally ill, drug-addled and lost.""Kinda look at it like he's in that dark hole right now. And if you can force treatment on him there's a chance he could possibly crawl out of it. But without some way to force him to do something, he won't do it,"" he says.California's Care Courts aim to assist people suffering with untreated severe mental illnessCalifornia's Care Court plan is part of the state Care Act, which passed the California legislature last Fall and signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who championed the project as a potentially transformative fix for a broken system.""I'm not interested in the status quo,"" Newsom said at the bill signing. ""I'm not interested in the compassionless-ness of the approach we have today of people moralizing and normalizing that suffering on the streets and sidewalks.""Care Courts launch as pilots this October in the counties of Glenn, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and the City and County of San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles County in December. Under the plan, a wide variety of people – including family, friends, first responders and clinicians – can petition a judge who could order mental health and other treatment and support under a two-year ""Care Plan"" that counties' behavioral health systems have to fund.""Over time we are really going to give Californians a new tool to support our neighbors who are both experiencing severe behavioral health conditions and the sequelae of those conditions like psychotic disorders and their connection to issues of housing instability, homelessness and the inability to meet basic needs,"" says Dr. Mark Ghaly, California's Secretary of Health and Human Services. ""I think that is transformational, that is a game-changer.""Dr. Ghaly estimates that Care Court will initially serve between 7,000 and 12,000 people across California.The rollout is being met with genuine optimism from some families like the Burdicks, who've struggled for years to get help for their son.But it's also meeting fierce opposition from some advocates who say the plan is coercive, dangerous and unconstitutionally vague.Any Care Plan would, in theory, be individualized but would likely include clinical treatment, bridge housing and other vital support. Participants will have access to an advocate and public defender to help make decisions about treatment and housing. As the state's health and human services department puts it, the goal is to give ill person the tools they need ""to make self-directed choices to the greatest extent possible.""""We're hearing from lot of families who have done everything that they've been able to do within their powers to care for their loved ones and still they haven't been able to see that person, you know, turn a corner or get to a place of wellness where they can even rejoin the family or community,"" says Dr. Lisa Wong, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, by far the largest region setting up a Care Court pilot later this year.""I think it's terribly frustrating and heartbreaking for a lot of these families,"" Dr. Wong says. ""And I think that Care Court is going to really be another tool in our toolbox to help with that. But I don't think that it's the answer to everything.""Disability and civil rights advocates question the program's motiveDisability and civil rights advocates allege that the program is really coercion masquerading as care. Those who refuse or fail to meet conditions of their Care Plans could be compelled to comply and even be placed under a conservatorship.""Care Court, as it's written right now, is unconstitutionally vague and it violates the civil rights of our clients with mental health disabilities who are homeless,"" says Christian Abasto, the legal advocacy director for Disability Rights California. The group is leading a coalition that has sued to stop the program.Abasto worries the program will end up pushing many people into involuntary outpatient treatment. ""It empowers parents, police, school persons to basically make an accusation and invoke the court system with potential confinement and potential infringement of the civil rights of people with mental health disabilities - when they have done nothing wrong,"" Abasto says.The group says the Care Act expands an already problematic system of court-ordered mental health treatment ""that goes back to the country's horrific history of ableism and subjecting disabled people to being a separate class.""""It's such a big lie,"" says Helen Tran, senior attorney with the Western Center on Law and Poverty, one of the groups that has filed suit to stop the Care Act, alongside Disability Rights California. ""If it is truly voluntary, why do you need the Care Act at all?""Tran worries people who fail to follow through on their judge-ordered treatment plans could be coerced into treatment to try to address the vexing political problem of Californians fed up with homelessness.Tran sees it as a back-door attempt to expand conservatorship where ill people ""risk losing so much more of their rights and their autonomy to control the type of medical care that they want, the housing that they want. It's just a difficult process to reverse so the risk of being permanently harmed by that, to us, is so great that it warrants the court's intervention before it's even implemented,"" she says.Instead of funding new courts, the coalition wants the state to dramatically boost funding for existing mental health treatment and housing for homeless persons with a mental illness.Outreach by social workers will be key to get people to participate voluntarilyGov. Newsom, a Democrat, recently proposed $1.5 billion in new funding for interim or ""bridge"" housing for people with mental health needs transitioning out of homelessness. He also proposed substantially expanding treatment of mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness through a 2024 ballot initiative. If passed, a bond would fund construction of new residential treatment facilities for mental illness and substance use disorders, create additional housing for homeless veterans, and require at least $1 billion annually for behavioral health housing and treatment by amending the state's Mental Health Services Act.Proponents also say any potential penalties for not complying with a Care Plan are being wildly exaggerated. The program hasn't even gotten off the ground.Dr. Wong, the director Los Angeles' behavioral health system, stresses that for Los Angeles and other counties going first, outreach and engagement by social workers will be key to getting people to participate voluntarily so they don't end up in court.But even if a case does end up in court, Dr. Wong insists, it's still a voluntary service. ""You know, we're not holding people against their will. There's no involuntary medication order or anything like that. So people still have the ability to say no.""Dr. Ghaly, California's HHS director, does not rule out having more people moved into conservatorship under Care Court. ""Absolutely that's a possibility. But my hope is that we see that potential as the reason why a lot of people do willingly and successfully participate in the program,"" he says.Meantime, many parents say the Care Court experiment will surely be better than watching their loved one cycle endlessly between crisis police ""holds,"" emergency rooms, jails, and homeless shelters or makeshift tent villages.""The discussion is almost bird-walked into civil rights, when it needs to be about medical treatment,"" says Elizabeth Hopper who lives outside Sacramento. Her daughter Christine Hopper is a former honors student and athlete who for years now has struggled with schizo-affective disorder alongside homelessness, substance use disorder and run-ins with the law. Christine is doing better now, her mom says, thanks only to a diversion program that mandated treatment following a felony arrest for assault.""Care Court could have saved at least seven or eight years of her life, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of revolving door ERs to psych hospitals back to the street,"" Elizabeth says. ""It can sound like, 'Oh, the family just wants to lock people away' and that's just not true. What we're hoping for is enough treatment where our person will be able to stand on their own as much as possible.""

1386,Dave Epstein Forecast: Expect a mixed bag of precipitation,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/22/dave-epstein-forecast-expect-a-mixed-bag-of-precipitation,It's not out of the question that we could see all four major precipitation types within 30 miles.,"You likely noticed the clouds have been increasing today, and this trend will continue through sunset leading to precipitation this evening. I expect a mixed bag to arrive between 5 and 8 p.m., moving from west to east. Somewhere around 6 or 7 p.m., precipitation should be heading into the greater Boston area.The type of precipitation you’ll see will depend on where you are. This is a very marginal situation in terms of precipitation type. It's not out of the question that we could see all four major precipitation types within 30 miles. The reason for the kitchen sink version of weather is a warm tongue of air pushing in at high levels of the atmosphere this evening. This will help create the lift necessary for snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain but will also make forecasting the exact type difficult.The trend overnight will be for the precipitation to transition to rain in all but the most northern areas. Before this happens we could see anywhere from a coating to a couple of inches of slop. If you're traveling, because temperatures will be within a few degrees of freezing, road conditions can change quickly. But I don't expect major issues.Tomorrow there will be a sharp contrast in temperature across southern New England. The map below shows readings in the lower 20s west of Route 128, but still in the lower 30s south of Boston. This type of setup can evolve into icy conditions fairly quickly as temperatures drop rapidly. Do not underestimate how quickly roads can become icy with even just a small amount of glaze.The risk for icing continues Thursday night with some additional light precipitation. You should be careful stepping out Friday morning as walkways could be icy. Again, this is not a major situation by any means. But untreated surfaces can become very hazardous with the thinnest of coatings. On Friday readings should get above freezing in greater Boston as sunshine returns.It becomes quite cold for Saturday morning with readings in the single digits west of the city. It will only reach the 20s Saturday afternoon. There could be a few snow showers on Sunday and it will not be as cold. There may be another messy weather system before we conclude February. Winter may not have been bad so far, but it isn’t over yet.",Local,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 13:42:48 EST",baad33b573aa6bf100464d1435badac1

Get to know their brain,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/23/want-to-understand-your-adolescent-get-to-know-their-brain,"For the parents of a teenager, adolescence can be a challenging time. But to a brain scientist, it's a marvel.","For the parents of a teenager, adolescence can be a challenging time. But to a brain scientist, it's a marvel.""I want people to understand that adolescence is not a disease, that adolescence is an amazing time of development,"" says Beatriz Luna, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh.That development is on display most afternoons at the Shaw Skatepark in Washington, D.C. It's a public site, filled with teens hanging out, taking risks, and learning new skills at a rapid pace.""When you're younger, your mind is more open, and you're more creative, and nothing matters,"" says Leo De Leon, 13. ""So you'll really try anything.""Leo has been skateboarding since he was 10. But getting the nerve to try a skate park for the first time was ""kind of scary,"" he says. ""I fell a lot when I first started. And I got hurt a lot.""Leo also got better — fast. And when he'd mastered one trick, he'd push himself to learn a new one, despite the risks.""I was trying to ollie up something, and then I clipped it and my board went up and it hit me in my mouth,"" he says, ""so now I have this scar.""Leo's also broken his arm and his elbows are a mess. But the payoff is, he can do things now like jump the flight of five stairs on the other side of the park.""I kickflipped that one,"" he says. ""It's on my Instagram.""Seeking new experiencesLeo's swift progress from frightened novice to accomplished skater shows the strengths of an adolescent brain.""It's an incredible brain,"" Luna says. ""It's just perfect for what it needs to do. And what it needs to do is gain experiences.""A child's brain goes through two critical periods of very rapid change.The first happens about age two, when most toddlers are busy walking, talking, climbing, and falling. The second critical period begins around puberty.""Adolescence is a time when the brain says, 'alright, you've had a lot of time now, we have to start making some decisions,'"" Luna saysDecisions like which connections to get rid of.""You're born with an excess of synaptic connections,"" Luna says. ""And based on experience, you keep what you use and you lose what you don't use.""It's a process known as synaptic pruning. And its imminent arrival may be one reason an adolescent brain seeks out new experiences, even if it means risking a broken arm or a broken heart.During this period the brain is also optimizing the wiring it decides to keep.""The connections that remain become myelinated,"" Luna says. ""That means they're insulated with fatty tissue, which not only speeds neuronal transmission, but protects from any further changes.""Sex differences in the brain and in behaviorAdolescent brain changes tend to start earlier in girls than in boys. And around this time, males and females also begin to react differently to certain experiences — like stress.That was one finding of an analysis of research on teens asked to perform tasks like solving an impossible math problem, or giving a talk to a group of strangers.""Males' blood pressure was higher than females,"" Luna says. But when participants were asked about the experience later, males said, ""oh it was fine,"" while females described it as ""extremely stressful.""Luna says that suggests there are some sex differences in certain brain circuits. But it's not clear whether those differences are the result of genetics, hormones, or social and cultural influences, she says.Regardless, sex differences are just a small part of the big changes sweeping through the brain during adolescence. And those changes continue throughout the teens and beyond.""A lot of times people will think, oh, too late, they're adolescents,"" Luna says. ""But no, because even though it is a time of vulnerabilities, it is also a window opportunity.""Adolescence, chimp styleAdolescence isn't just for humans. It's also present in chimpanzees.""There's something really charming about the chimps when they're going through this adolescent period,"" says Alexandra Rosati, an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at the University of Michigan. ""They look kind of gangly. They have these new big teeth in their mouth.""And, of course, they are experiencing puberty.""They're going through this physical change in the body and those same hormones are resculpting the brain, basically, during this period,"" Rosati says.Part of this resculpting involves the willingness to take risks.Rosati was part of a team that did a gambling experiment with 40 chimps of various ages at a sanctuary in the Republic of Congo.The chimps had a choice. They could go for a sure thing: peanuts. Or they could select a mystery option that might be a boring cucumber or a delicious banana.""Adolescent chimpanzees were more willing to make that gamble,"" Rosati says. ""They were more likely to choose that risky option and hopefully get the banana, whereas adults were more likely to play it safe.""That suggests young humans and chimps are both predisposed to risky behavior.""The fact that we see these shifts in risk taking in the chimps suggests that this is tracking something biological,"" Rosati says. ""It's not something to do with human culture or the way children are exposed to the media or something.""For both species, Rosati says, there's a purpose to this kind of risk-taking. ""This period of adolescent risk-taking lets children grow into adults who are learning to live independently,"" she says.Risky business and dopamineSo how does the brain of an adolescent chimp or a human encourage risk-taking? With dopamine, a naturally occurring chemical involved in memory, motivation, and reward.Adolescent brains produce more dopamine and are more sensitive to the chemical than adult brains, says Adriana Galván, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles.That means a bigger payoff from positive experiences like eating a piece of chocolate, or just hanging out with friends.""It's a feedback loop,"" she says, ""because then you start thinking, well, that was pretty good. I'm going to get that to happen again.""This amped up reward system also helps young brains learn faster by pushing boundaries and constantly asking, ""What happens when I do this?"" Galván says, ""because that is how we learn best.""But big rewards and fast learning can make the adolescent brain vulnerable to some behaviors that are damaging, rather than useful.""If the behavior is doing drugs, the brain is saying, 'oh okay, this is what I should be paying attention to and devoting my neurons and my pathways to,'"" Galván says. ""So you strengthen that. And eventually that is how addiction happens.""The brain's vulnerability during adolescence is probably one reason so many adult smokers picked up the habit as teens, Galván says.Over the course of adolescence, though the brain's priorities change, she says. Early on, it gives more attention to positive experiences than painful ones. But then, the balance begins to shift.That seems to be happening with Leo the skateboarder.""I used to do a lot of stair sets,"" he says. ""I feel like I'm old now because I can't really do them anymore because they hurt.""All of which suggests that Leo's brain is developing exactly the way it's supposed to.

3740,A roadblock to life-saving addiction treatment is gone. Now what?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/06/a-roadblock-to-life-saving-addiction-treatment-is-gone-now-what,"For two decades — as opioid overdose deaths rose steadily — the federal government limited access to buprenorphine, a medication that addiction experts consider the gold-standard for treating patients with an opioid use disorder.

Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.Clinicians who wanted to prescribe the medicine had to complete an 8-hour training. They could only treat a limited number of patients and had to keep special records. They were given a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number starting with X, a designation that many doctors say made them a target for drug enforcement audits.""Just the process associated with taking care of our patients with a substance use disorder made us feel like, 'boy, this is dangerous stuff,'"" says Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, who chairs the American Medical Association's task force on substance use disorder.""The science doesn't support that but the rigamarole suggested that.""That rigamarole is mostly gone. Congress eliminated what became known as the ""X-waiver"" in legislation President Biden signed late last year. Now begins what some addiction experts are calling a truth serum moment.Was the X-waiver and the burdens that came with it the real reason only about 7% of clinicians in the U.S. were cleared to prescribe buprenorphine? Or was it an excuse that masked hesitation about treating addiction, if not outright disdain for these patients?There's great optimism among some leaders that getting rid of the X-waiver will expand access to buprenorphine and reduce overdoses. One study from 2021 shows taking buprenorphine reduces the risk by 50%. The medication is an opioid that produces much weaker effects than heroin or fentanyl and reduces cravings for those deadlier drugs.The nation's drug czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, says getting rid of the X-waiver will ultimately prevent millions of deaths.""The impact of this will be felt for years to come,"" Gupta says. ""It is a true historic change that, frankly, I could only dream of being possible.""Gupta and others envision obstetricians prescribing buprenorphine to their pregnant patients, infectious disease doctors adding it to their medical tool box, and lots more patients starting buprenorphine when they come to emergency rooms, primary care clinics and rehabilitation facilities.We are ""transforming the way we think to make every moment an opportunity to start this treatment and save someone's life,"" says Dr. Sarah Wakeman, the medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston.Wakeman says clinicians who she's been reaching out to for the past decade are finally willing to consider treating patients with buprenorphine. Still, she knows stigma and discrimination could undermine efforts to help those who aren't being served. In 2021, a national survey showed just 22% of people with an opioid use disorder received buprenorphine or methadone, which is another form of medication-assisted treatment.The truth serum experimentThe truth serum experiment – what will test whether clinicians will now step up prescribing – is underway in hospitals and clinics across the country as patients struggling with addiction queue up for treatment.One woman named Kim, 65, is among them.Kim's recent visit to the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center in southern Massachusetts began in an exam room with Jamie Simmons, a registered nurse who runs the center's addiction treatment program but doesn't have prescribing powers. NPR agreed to use only Kim's first name to limit discrimination linked to her drug use.Kim tells Simmons that buprenorphine has helped her stay off heroin and avoid an overdose for nearly 20 years. Kim takes a brand of the medication called Suboxone, which comes in the form of thin film-like strips she dissolves under her tongue.""It's the best thing they could have ever come out with,"" Kim says, ""I don't think I ever even had a desire to use heroin since I've been taking them.""Buprenorphine can produce mild euphoria and slow breathing but there's a ceiling on the effects. Patients like Kim may develop a tolerance and not experience any effects.""I don't get high on Suboxones,"" Kim says, ""they just keep me normal.""Still many clinicians have been hesitant to use buprenorphine – known as a partial opioid agonist – to treat an addiction to more deadly forms of the drug.Kim's primary care doctor at the health center never applied for an X-waiver. So for years Kim has bounced from one treatment program to another, seeking a prescription. When there were lapses in her access to buprenorphine, the cravings returned – an especially scary prospect now that the powerful opioid fentanyl has replaced heroin on the streets of Massachusetts, where Kim lives.""I've seen so many people fall out [overdose] in the last month,"" says Kim, her eyes wide, ""that stuff is so strong that within a couple minutes, boom.""Because fentanyl can kill so quickly, the benefits of taking buprenorphine and other medications to treat an opioid use disorder have increased as deaths linked to even stronger types of fentanyl rise. Buprenorphine is present in a small percentage of overdose deaths nationwide, 2.6% – virtually always with a mix of other drugs, often benzodiazepines. Fentanyl is in 94% of overdose deaths in Massachusetts.""Bottom line is, fentanyl kills people, buprenorphine doesn't,"" Simmons says.That reality adds urgency to Kim's health center visit because Kim took her last Suboxone before arriving. Her latest prescription has run out. Cravings for heroin could resume tomorrow if she doesn't get more Suboxone. Simmons confirms the dose and tells Kim that her primary care doctor may be willing to renew the prescription now that the X-waiver is not required. But Dr. Than Win has some concerns after reviewing Kim's most recent urine test.It showed traces of cocaine, fentanyl, marijuana and Xanax, and Win says she's worried about how the street drugs might interact with buprenorphine.""I don't want my patients to die from an overdose,"" Win says. ""But I'm not comfortable with the fentanyl and a lot of narcotics in the system.""Kim is adamant that she's not intentionally ingesting fentanyl. It might have been in the cocaine she says her roommate shares occasionally. Kim says she takes the Xanax to sleep. Her drug use presents complications that many primary care doctors don't have experience managing. Some clinicians are apprehensive about using an opioid to treat an addiction to opioids, despite compelling evidence that it saves patients' lives.Win is worried about writing her first prescription for Suboxone. But she agrees to help Kim stay on the medication.""I wanted to start with someone a little bit easier,"" Win says. ""It's hard for me, that's the reality and truth.""About half of the providers at the health center had an X-waiver when it was still required. Simmons says some of the resistance to having the waiver was rooted in stigma or misunderstanding about addiction. She urges doctors to treat addiction as they would any other disease.""You wouldn't not treat a diabetic, you wouldn't not treat a patient who is hypertensive,"" Simmons says. ""People can't control that they formed an addiction to an opiate, alcohol or a benzo.""Searching for solutions to soften stigmaAlthough the restrictions on buprenorphine prescribing are no longer in place, Dr. Mukkamala says the perception created by the X-waiver lingers.""That legacy of elevating this to a level of scrutiny and caution, that needs to be sort of walked back,"" says Mukkamala with the AMA. ""That's going to come from education.""Mukkamala sees promise in the next generation of doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants coming out of schools that have added addiction training. The AMA and the American Society of Addiction Medicine have online resources for clinicians who want to learn on their own.Some of these resources may help fulfill a new training requirement for clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine and other controlled narcotics. It will take effect in June. The DEA has not issued details about that training.But training alone may not shift behavior: take the experience of Rhode Island.The number of doctors approved to prescribe buprenorphine jumped more than 200% from 2016 to 2022 after the state said physician training should include an X-waiver. Still, having the option to prescribe buprenorphine ""didn't open the floodgates"" for patients in need of treatment, says Dr. Jody Rich, an addiction specialist who teaches at Brown University. The number of patients taking buprenorphine in Rhode Island increased – from 2016 to 2022 when the number of qualified prescribers jumped – but at a much slower rate .""It all comes back to stigma,"" Rich says.He says longstanding resistance among some providers to treating addiction is shifting as younger people enter medicine. But the opioid crisis can't wait for a generational change, he says. To expand buprenorphine access now, Rich's research shows states could use pharmacists, partnered with doctors, to help manage the care of more patients with an opioid use disorder.Wakeman, at Mass General Brigham, says it might be time to hold clinicians who don't provide addiction care accountable through quality measures tied to payments.""We're expected to care for patients with diabetes or to care for patients with heart attack in a certain way and the same should be true for patients with an opioid use disorder,"" says Wakeman.One quality measure could be to track how often prescribers start and continue buprenorphine treatment. Wakeman says it would also help if insurers reimbursed clinics for the cost of staff who aren't traditional clinicians but are critical in addiction care, like recovery coaches and case managers.Will ending the X-waiver close racial gaps?Wakeman and others are paying especially close attention to whether eliminating the X-waiver helps narrow racial gaps in buprenorphine treatment.The medication is much more commonly prescribed to white patients with private insurance or who can pay cash. But there are also stark differences by race at some health centers where most patients are on Medicaid and would seem to have equal access to this addiction treatment.At the New Bedford health center, Black patients represent 15% of all patients but only 6% of those taking buprenorphine. For Hispanics that comparison is 30% to 23%. Most of the health center patients prescribed buprenorphine are white, 61%, while they are just 36% of patients overall.Dr. Helena Hansen, who co-authored a book on race in the opioid epidemic, says access to buprenorphine doesn't guarantee that patients will benefit from it.""People are not able to stay on a life-saving medication unless the immense instability in housing, employment, social supports — the very fabric of their communities — is addressed,"" says Hansen. ""That's where we fall incredibly short in the United States.""Hansen says expanding access to buprenorphine has helped reduce overdose deaths dramatically among all drug users in France, including those who are low-income and immigrants. There, patients with an opioid use disorder are seen in their communities and offered a wide range of social services.""Removing the X-waiver,"" says Hansen, ""is not in itself going to revolutionize the opioid overdose crisis in our country. We would need to do much more.""This story is from of NPR's partnership with WBUR and KHN. KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

544,The divinity of Beyoncé’s ‘Church Girl’,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/08/01/the-divinity-of-beyonces-church-girl,"For some people, the song “Church Girl” has a divine meaning.","Beyoncé is not an ordained minister or a deity. But for some people, the song “Church Girl,” off her 2022 album Renaissance, has a divine meaning — not to mention the odes to New Orleans bounce music, gospel and hip hop all in one. To understand this song, you need to understand who it's for. “I am a church girl in every sense of the word,” said Shaplaie Brooks. “People who are queer and people who are ‘other,’ we come to this kind of personal moment where we feel liberated and we start to remember the things that we were taught, that the church is within us.” TJ Johnson, too, is “undoubtedly a church girl, through and through.”“The church has broken my heart many times,” Johnson said. “I've had churches tell me that I couldn't sing in their choirs because I was gay. I've had people tell me I couldn't do certain programs.”Dominic Glaude said that when the song comes on, “Oh! you gotta dance.”Like Johnson, Glaude and Brooks, I grew up in the church. Needless to say, dropping it ""like a thottie,"" as Beyoncé implores, was not in any of the sermons. But being a good Christian was. So what happened when people said you weren't?“I'm a queer trans man,” Glaude said. “It took me time to figure that out. But as I was going through that stage in the church and being a Christian and stuff, it was shunned upon to like [someone of the] same gender or, you know, change the gender, things like that.”People who grow up in the church and feel unwelcome — especially because of their gender or sexuality — are often left building their own welcoming, loving communities. “We no longer need that community that is not affirming, and we create our own community,” Brooks said. “And I love that about us. I love that about us as Black people. I love that about us as Black queer people and as Black queer church kids.”The Rev. Irene Monroe, contributor to GBH and the All Rev'd Up podcast, said overcoming judgment is a common experience in the church, whether parishioners identify as queer or not. And Beyoncé reflects that in her song.""She is talking about bodily autonomy as God-given,” Monroe said. “There's a thing with Black church conservatives like, ‘mhmm, we know what you were doing on Saturday.’ Yes. And we come to defend it on Sunday.”The song holds that duality, Monroe said. “We are sexual, sensual and spiritual,” she said. “We're ratchet, religious and righteous. We're human and holy.”That duality is in the song's composition, too. It samples ""Center of Thy Will"" from the gospel group The Clark Sisters.Then echoes the raunchiness of bounce legend DJ Jimi.As the Rev. Monroe explains, it's the kind of genre-bending Beyoncé is known for. “You really see the blurring between the sacred and the profane,” she said. “It's a performance piece in terms of theology, because church liturgy we have, as well as the lyrics. But what I’ve named it as is a Black feminist body theology, we call that woman as theology. And what it is saying is that our lives are sacred texts.”As for the gender bending, the album as a whole is an ode to the Black and queer roots of disco and house music, and a rallying call for freedom and joy.""What's she saying is, let me pull up the lyrics — turn to the book of Beylations!” Johnson said. “She's talking about how she's been down, doing all this work, doing all this labor. And you know what, I'm about to go out. I don't care what y'all gotta say. I don't care who lookin’.” That goes for the congregation, too.“[Expletive] what they say,” Glaude said. “I'm here for the sermon and I'm here for the music. I'm gonna come in here and be myself and reclaim my space.”Saints and sinners alike. “Unfortunately there is divinity that comes from persecution,” Brooks said. “And when I think of queer divinity, I think of a perfected lens and being able to have this aerial view of the world in a way that is so wildly introspective. And it literally feels like we are one with God.""",Local,"Tue, 01 Aug 2023 05:00:38 EST",76fb18049ef3ec5769ce459ccfbd0c71

Enslaved Africans brought their cooking and farming traditions to the Americas, and those were then transformed by the conditions they faced. The heritage of many recipes considered today to be soul food were founded in the crops and techniques first developed by enslaved communities.Today, Black chefs and restaurant owners are bringing traditional elements into their recipes and adding their own creativity, as well as sharing recipes from all corners of the globe.But through all the different flavors is the same heart: community.Kwasi Kwaa, chef and partner of Comfort Kitchen in Dorchester, is one person bringing these foods to the forefront in Boston. He whipped up jackfruit sliders with jerk seasoning on the set of Basic Black. Kwaa, who is from Ghana, said tastes are changing as people become more adventurous with food. He started his career making lots of French and Italian food, despite wanting to explore African cuisine, which he described as a sad period of his career. But now, there's a paradigm shift. ""I think in past years, and with the help of television ... and food shows and things like that, people have broadened their horizons in terms of what they can try, and folks have become more adventurous eaters, if you would,"" Kwaa said. As people branch out to try new foods, they also love the classics, such as what is served up at Coast Café in Cambridge, where Anthony ""Tony"" Brooks is the chef and owner. His fried chicken and mac and cheese is pure home cooking. Brooks made his signature mac and cheese on Basic Black, which he said is his most popular side dish. That home cooking is what customers are looking for. Brooks said, ""We're cooking from our heart and people are looking for that artist ... I look at it as art to me, not just cooking."" Paula Austin, assistant professor of history and African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, described Black food as diverse, and a ""cultural explosion"" that varies from region to region. Mac and cheese in one state might not be the same recipe in another state, or another part of the world even. ""Black foodways is not monolithic, but there are so many different things that come together to make the particular dishes or to make those particular preparations that are, you know, West African, Indigenous,"" Austin said. The guests closed out the segment sharing some of the favorite foods that are always making it onto their plate. Austin loves fried plantains, Brooks eats steak and potatoes and Kwaa loves chicken stock more than he loves a whole roast chicken.Watch: How are local Black chefs making their mark on the history of Black cuisine?Watch the latest episode of Basic Black at 7:30 p.m. Fridays on GBH 2 or live on our website.

1019,Supreme Court ruling on municipal foreclosures will preserve equity for Massachusetts homeowners,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/26/supreme-court-ruling-on-municipal-foreclosures-could-impact-some-20-massachusetts-communities,Court says cities and towns can't profit unconditionally when foreclosing on homes.,"Cities and towns in Massachusetts and across the nation no longer will be able to foreclose on a person’s home and automatically take all the profits, according to a new U.S. Supreme Court ruling released on Thursday. The decision struck down a lower court ruling that allowed a county in Minnesota to foreclose on an elderly woman's condominium because she owed $15,000 in property taxes — and let the county keep all the profits from a $40,000 sale of the home. The Supreme Court determined that the county could foreclose on the property to settle the tax bill, but that keeping profits beyond what is owed violate constitutional protections against unjust taking of a property without fair compensation. Once the tax bill is paid, the court ruled that any remaining funds from a sale belong to the former owner.The decision was welcomed by housing advocates and others in Massachusetts who have long criticized the practice. A recent study by the Libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation found homeowners in 30 cities and towns in Massachusetts collectively lost an estimated $97 million in equity through foreclosure over a six-year period. John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center based in Boston, said the ruling will stop what he described as ""equity theft in tax foreclosures.” Rao has long been a critic of the practice. “Hopefully, it will also encourage municipalities and private investors to work on better solutions to help homeowners avoid tax sales and the loss of their homes,” he said.Paul Meaney of Worcester told GBH News that the ruling will offer protections to homeowners like him. Meaney almost lost four properties several years ago after failing to pay water and sewer bills in a misunderstanding with the city.“I think it is fair and equitable and just,’’ Meaney said about the top court’s ruling. “It is egregious that cities and towns can profit from people’s hardship.”Worcester is one of 20 municipalities in Massachusetts that engage in a practice related to what the high court ruled against: selling the liens for delinquent taxes or utility bills to third-party companies, which then turn around and foreclose on the homes. The process has been criticized for providing an incentive for cities and towns to stack the odds against homeowners who have fallen behind on taxes. City leaders have argued the auctions are an effective way for cash-strapped cities to get needed funding from delinquent homeowners. A major contention is the fact that tax lien foreclosures allow municipalities and investors to take everything, including equity. Meaney ended up saving his properties but says state and city officials should do more to educate homeowners about the risks of not paying even a small bill. “I was able to spend a lot money and fight them and get my houses back,’’ he said. “But a lot of people can’t do that.”Todd Kaplan of Greater Boston Legal Services says advocates have long fought to make improvements to protect homeowners in the state Legislature but have made little progress. He said now what needs to be done is justice for those who already lost their homes. His office is supporting a Worcester woman who is fighting the sale of her home to a private company over $2,600 in unpaid real estate taxes. “The decision confirms something we already know, that this has been an incredibly unjust and unconstitutional process where people who are house rich and cash poor are having their homes stolen from them by municipalities,’’ he said. “The logical fall out from this decision is Massachusetts is going to have to change the way tax foreclosures happen.”SeparatorGBH News reporter Sam Turken contributed to this report.",Local,"Fri, 26 May 2023 13:19:15 EST",b4e9672f0a17708d4b4ebb089015402f

Wu said the O'Bryant school would receive a new and bigger campus, and Madison Park will undergo renovations at a cost of $18 million. Wu did not elaborate on how the money would be divided between the two schools.“What is before our young people shouldn't depend on which school they attend or what building they've been enrolled at,” Wu said at a Tuesday press conference at City Hall. “The school's physical environment should reflect our academic one, spaces designed to nurture big ideas, not confine them.”The West Roxbury Educational Complex was previously home to two high schools: the Urban Science Academy and West Roxbury Academy. Former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh shuttered the school there despite outcry from parents and students, and it has sat empty for five years since then.Wu said the O'Bryant high school has no room to expand at its current location, which means it hasn’t been able to enroll as many students as the city’s two other exam schools, the Boston Latin Academy and the Boston Latin School.By moving to the complex, the O’Bryant could accept 400 more students, bringing its population up to 2,000 students and expanding its seventh and eighth grade classes. Wu said the brand new building could offer expanded programming in biomedical science, engineering and computer science, as well as state-of-the-art labs and facilities.The change would give ""more young people the opportunity to learn in this wonderful community,” Wu said. Wu said the city will offer shuttles to the school for students from various Boston neighborhoods. In a nod to the city's significant busing problems getting students to school on time or at all, Wu said her team is already working on options.“That means ensuring that transportation will not be a barrier to reaching this one of a kind campus, no matter where you live in the city,"" she said.Programming at Madison Park vocational school will also expand into the former O'Bryant space. Wu said that the vocational school will add new career technical education programs, like environmental sciences, robotics, biotech and early childhood education. Officials said construction at both Madison Park and the West Roxbury complex should begin in early 2025.",Education,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 09:50:27 EST",f20bd8dbec90b8cea7ca16d76c6b8a31

Get to know their brain,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/23/want-to-understand-your-adolescent-get-to-know-their-brain,"For the parents of a teenager, adolescence can be a challenging time. But to a brain scientist, it's a marvel.","For the parents of a teenager, adolescence can be a challenging time. But to a brain scientist, it's a marvel.""I want people to understand that adolescence is not a disease, that adolescence is an amazing time of development,"" says Beatriz Luna, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh.That development is on display most afternoons at the Shaw Skatepark in Washington, D.C. It's a public site, filled with teens hanging out, taking risks, and learning new skills at a rapid pace.""When you're younger, your mind is more open, and you're more creative, and nothing matters,"" says Leo De Leon, 13. ""So you'll really try anything.""Leo has been skateboarding since he was 10. But getting the nerve to try a skate park for the first time was ""kind of scary,"" he says. ""I fell a lot when I first started. And I got hurt a lot.""Leo also got better — fast. And when he'd mastered one trick, he'd push himself to learn a new one, despite the risks.""I was trying to ollie up something, and then I clipped it and my board went up and it hit me in my mouth,"" he says, ""so now I have this scar.""Leo's also broken his arm and his elbows are a mess. But the payoff is, he can do things now like jump the flight of five stairs on the other side of the park.""I kickflipped that one,"" he says. ""It's on my Instagram.""Seeking new experiencesLeo's swift progress from frightened novice to accomplished skater shows the strengths of an adolescent brain.""It's an incredible brain,"" Luna says. ""It's just perfect for what it needs to do. And what it needs to do is gain experiences.""A child's brain goes through two critical periods of very rapid change.The first happens about age two, when most toddlers are busy walking, talking, climbing, and falling. The second critical period begins around puberty.""Adolescence is a time when the brain says, 'alright, you've had a lot of time now, we have to start making some decisions,'"" Luna saysDecisions like which connections to get rid of.""You're born with an excess of synaptic connections,"" Luna says. ""And based on experience, you keep what you use and you lose what you don't use.""It's a process known as synaptic pruning. And its imminent arrival may be one reason an adolescent brain seeks out new experiences, even if it means risking a broken arm or a broken heart.During this period the brain is also optimizing the wiring it decides to keep.""The connections that remain become myelinated,"" Luna says. ""That means they're insulated with fatty tissue, which not only speeds neuronal transmission, but protects from any further changes.""Sex differences in the brain and in behaviorAdolescent brain changes tend to start earlier in girls than in boys. And around this time, males and females also begin to react differently to certain experiences — like stress.That was one finding of an analysis of research on teens asked to perform tasks like solving an impossible math problem, or giving a talk to a group of strangers.""Males' blood pressure was higher than females,"" Luna says. But when participants were asked about the experience later, males said, ""oh it was fine,"" while females described it as ""extremely stressful.""Luna says that suggests there are some sex differences in certain brain circuits. But it's not clear whether those differences are the result of genetics, hormones, or social and cultural influences, she says.Regardless, sex differences are just a small part of the big changes sweeping through the brain during adolescence. And those changes continue throughout the teens and beyond.""A lot of times people will think, oh, too late, they're adolescents,"" Luna says. ""But no, because even though it is a time of vulnerabilities, it is also a window opportunity.""Adolescence, chimp styleAdolescence isn't just for humans. It's also present in chimpanzees.""There's something really charming about the chimps when they're going through this adolescent period,"" says Alexandra Rosati, an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at the University of Michigan. ""They look kind of gangly. They have these new big teeth in their mouth.""And, of course, they are experiencing puberty.""They're going through this physical change in the body and those same hormones are resculpting the brain, basically, during this period,"" Rosati says.Part of this resculpting involves the willingness to take risks.Rosati was part of a team that did a gambling experiment with 40 chimps of various ages at a sanctuary in the Republic of Congo.The chimps had a choice. They could go for a sure thing: peanuts. Or they could select a mystery option that might be a boring cucumber or a delicious banana.""Adolescent chimpanzees were more willing to make that gamble,"" Rosati says. ""They were more likely to choose that risky option and hopefully get the banana, whereas adults were more likely to play it safe.""That suggests young humans and chimps are both predisposed to risky behavior.""The fact that we see these shifts in risk taking in the chimps suggests that this is tracking something biological,"" Rosati says. ""It's not something to do with human culture or the way children are exposed to the media or something.""For both species, Rosati says, there's a purpose to this kind of risk-taking. ""This period of adolescent risk-taking lets children grow into adults who are learning to live independently,"" she says.Risky business and dopamineSo how does the brain of an adolescent chimp or a human encourage risk-taking? With dopamine, a naturally occurring chemical involved in memory, motivation, and reward.Adolescent brains produce more dopamine and are more sensitive to the chemical than adult brains, says Adriana Galván, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles.That means a bigger payoff from positive experiences like eating a piece of chocolate, or just hanging out with friends.""It's a feedback loop,"" she says, ""because then you start thinking, well, that was pretty good. I'm going to get that to happen again.""This amped up reward system also helps young brains learn faster by pushing boundaries and constantly asking, ""What happens when I do this?"" Galván says, ""because that is how we learn best.""But big rewards and fast learning can make the adolescent brain vulnerable to some behaviors that are damaging, rather than useful.""If the behavior is doing drugs, the brain is saying, 'oh okay, this is what I should be paying attention to and devoting my neurons and my pathways to,'"" Galván says. ""So you strengthen that. And eventually that is how addiction happens.""The brain's vulnerability during adolescence is probably one reason so many adult smokers picked up the habit as teens, Galván says.Over the course of adolescence, though the brain's priorities change, she says. Early on, it gives more attention to positive experiences than painful ones. But then, the balance begins to shift.That seems to be happening with Leo the skateboarder.""I used to do a lot of stair sets,"" he says. ""I feel like I'm old now because I can't really do them anymore because they hurt.""All of which suggests that Leo's brain is developing exactly the way it's supposed to.

6532,Worcester councilors asked to regulate anti-abortion centers. It still hasn't happened.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/19/worcester-councilors-asked-to-regulate-anti-abortion-centers-it-still-hasnt-happened,Officials asked City Manager Eric Batista to draft the ordinance last year.,"A Worcester City Council meeting Tuesday night turned into a tense debate over anti-abortion counseling businesses, often known as ""crisis pregnancy centers,"" and why City Manager Eric Batista has refused to regulate them. In July 2022, councilors voted to have Batista draft an ordinance that would penalize the centers if they use deceptive advertising tactics to present themselves as comprehensive pregnancy healthcare facilities. Batista has yet to deliver that draft, which prompted Councilor Thu Nguyen to ask for an update at Tuesday’s meeting. Batista said he has not followed through on the council’s request out of concern the law could subject the city to First Amendment lawsuits. He added that then-Attorney General Maura Healey’s office advised Worcester's legal team last year to not go through with the ordinance. The city occasionally consults with state officials about local policy, Batista noted.“I have a strong responsibility not only to the residents of the city and the taxpayers of the city, but overall, I need to make a decision that I can't put ourselves in a position where we're going to be legally liable,” he said. The city manager added that he thought he addressed his legal concerns in previous private meetings with councilors. He said legislative requests are often resolved with councilors behind closed doors without being brought to the council floor. That response did not satisfy Nguyen and other councilors, who pressed Batista on why he wasn’t more transparent with the public about his decision making.“I think there’s a lot of backdoor conversations that’s happening here that I’m not too happy about,” Nguyen said. “Is it at the discretion of the city manager to decide to not follow the political will of the council?”Councilor Khrystian King added he would have preferred a written, public recommendation from Batista and the city’s legal team about whether to move forward with the ordinance. Even if the ordinance was legally unsound, King said City Council should have the final say about how to proceed. “If this body decides it is worth a legal fight, then that it is our decision on behalf of the citizenry,” he said. The debate Tuesday came after a Worcester woman filed a class-action lawsuit in June against one of two anti-abortion centers in the city. The woman alleged that a Clearway Clinic worker, who was not a licensed physician, failed to diagnose her ectopic pregnancy during an ultrasound and instead told her the pregnancy was safe. About a month after the ultrasound, the woman needed life-saving emergency surgery to address internal bleeding from a ruptured fallopian tube. Soon after the lawsuit became public, Nguyen posted a statement on social media saying they heard Worcester’s draft ordinance regulating anti-abortion counseling centers has not made it to the City Council floor because the state attorney general’s office advised against it. Then on Monday, the news outlet Patch released text messages obtained via a public records request between Worcester City Solicitor Michael Traynor and Assistant Attorney General Margaret Hurley. In the texts, Traynor said he had “great reservations” about the ordinance.The attorney general’s office has not responded to GBH News' request for comment about Hurley’s communications with Traynor. The fate of the ordinance and whether Worcester does anything to regulate anti-abortion counseling centers remains unclear. During Tuesday’s meeting, some councilors, including Kate Toomey and Moe Bergman, agreed Worcester shouldn’t move forward with a new regulation if it means the city could be sued. Toomey noted there are existing state laws that allow consumers to file complaints against businesses that use deceptive advertising tactics. Still, Councilor George Russell said Worcester needs to take some action to further protect residents. That could involve a public education campaign that spreads awareness about “crisis pregnancy centers” and their desire to steer people away from abortions. “People in the city of Worcester, whether they're residents or business, should feel confident that when they're going to any business, especially medical … that the services that they're presenting are actually being provided,” Russell said.Mayor Joseph Petty ended debate on the issue by holding it under personal privilege, a maneuver that suspends discussion until the council’s next meeting in August.",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 11:17:09 EST",200b0a34de9e6608aa0d6bb9e555a75f
2289,Boston rent control opposition deepens with landlords’ lawsuit,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/28/boston-rent-control-opposition-deepens-with-landlords-lawsuit,MassLandlords’ suit hones in on into big developers’ influence in the Wu administration’s rent control task force.,"MassLandlords, the nonprofit trade association that represents approximately 2,400 landlords across Greater Boston, is charging that Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s rent control proposal protects larger, corporate housing operators. “This rent control proposal could have gone any number of ways, but to us as small landlords, it seems to be the result of developer lobbying,” said Douglas Quattrochi, MassLandlords’ executive director. He stopped short of outrightly accusing the mayor of cronyism but noted that several members of the committee that helped craft Wu’s proposal were contributors to at least one of her political campaigns. The trade group’s newly filed lawsuit seeks to force the city to dilvulge documents that show how the members of the mayor’s Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee were selected. “We actually asked a year ago to find out why MassLandlords and other landlord organizations weren’t invited to the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee. ... We got rejected in our records request,” Quattrochi said. “But, then once the proposal came out, a whole bunch of warning bells started to go off because we looked at who was on the Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee and, in terms of campaign dollars donated, it's all developers. And you look at who's exempted under the rent control proposal and it's developers.“So we're trying to find out and we're trying to show if lobbying was at play here in the creation of this rent control proposal,” he said. “It seems like it’s going to benefit developers more than landlords and renters.”“The public has an interest in knowing what communications passed between [the city of Boston] and who became members of the committee, how the Mayor came to choose those particular individuals, and what motivation may exist for them to persist in advocating for policies know to economists and to the general public to be harmful and contrary to the public interest,” a portion of the legal complaint reads.Quattrochi noted that MassLandlords, which is based in Cambridge, was not invited to take part in the proposal’s crafting. Less than 5% of MassLandlords’ members reside in Boston. An even smaller portion operate housing within the city. Wu is seeking to set up a local rent control option for Boston, despite the policy being banned by statewide referendum in 1994. It would require approval from Boston City Council, the state Legislature and the governor to become law.The mayor’s proposal, now before the City Council, would restrict yearly rent increases to a maximum of 10% in high inflation years and the rate of inflation plus 6% in average years. Wu’s exemptions include: a 15-year shield for both new and past construction starting from the year the building’s certificate of occupancy was issued, and another for landlords who own six units or less and live on site with their tenants. Quattrochi said these exemptions leave out a large swath of landlords that could still reasonably be considered small and would be unfairly burdened. “If [the mayor] had actually talked to us, or invited us to sit on the committee, she would’ve heard immediately that there are so many of our members who live across the street from their properties or in the same neighborhood around the corner from [them], but they’re not in their properties,” he said.Wu’s proposal also calls for a rent control board or administrator to oversee local rent regulation. Quattrochi said that could create problems for small landlords who may end up needing to ask for permission to make certain improvements to their properties as they did under past rent control regulations while developers enjoy an extended exemption. Stakeholders across Greater Boston’s development sector are now publicly speaking out against Wu’s effort. The Greater Boston Real Estate launched a $400,000 campaign against rent control this month. The mayor has dismissed criticism of her proposal, insisting that it is the balanced approach necessary to allow stability for both housing operators and renters.While appearing on WBUR’s “Radio Boston” earlier this week, Wu expressed confidence that the transparency concerns raised in the lawsuit will be “sorted out,” and said, “many of the special interest groups who might be either listening to fearmongering or practicing fearmongering here really are just trying to stop a policy that that people are scared of.” “Whether it’s a group that is trying to put a lawsuit forward to just add more news and make sure that there’s as much potential delay in the process as possible, to others who are putting money behind an effort to put a message out there that this is taking us backwards, or assert that City Hall can’t do math or this or that — this is a different proposal that we’re putting forward now compared to what used to exist in Massachusetts and in many places decades ago, or even in some of the cities that are being brought up as examples of what to avoid,” Wu said.Quattrochi insisted the trade group will see the records request through.“If there were something in the emails, I think it would just further discredit the mayor’s proposal,” he said. “I think this rent control thing is just some incomprehensible distraction at best, and I'm worried that it’s actually been a lobbying effort of nonprofit and for-profit developers here. ... Whatever we find, we’re going to continue to look into this.” Last March, the group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain “any and all City of Boston emails to, from, or cc’ing” advisory committee members for the year before Wu announced them, according to the lawsuit filed late last week. The administration, after prodding from the state, only returned a welcome email dated the day after Wu publicly announced advisory committee members and a response stating that invitations to the committee were given through phone calls. “The implication that in the period March 2021 to March 2022 there were absolutely no email communications between any City department and any of the individuals who went on to become members of the Mayor’s Rent Stabilization Committee struck [MassLandlords] as not credible,” the lawsuit said.The filing goes on to decry rent control as a policy that will cause “availability discrimination,” a phenomenon where landlords hold properties vacant in order to select tenants with good credit scores and high income. MassLandlords’ legal complaint also implied a connection between the advisory committee members and contributions to various campaigns for public office. Seventeen of the 25 members put money toward “Massachusetts political races,” the lawsuit alleges.The group, Quattrochi said, is opposed to rent control in all forms, but would support a “Chapter 40P” program — named for the state law rent control carveout that allows cities and towns to enact rent control and pay landlords the difference between market rent rates and controlled rents.",Politics,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:53:23 EST",bcd5d39a9863d85dfe7c43bee91a0b08
3468,Massachusetts needs more housing. How much should be affordable vs. high-end?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/20/massachusetts-needs-more-housing-how-much-should-be-affordable-vs-high-end,The state is trying to build new homes and apartments to address a housing crisis.,"When Alexander Train walks around Chelsea, he sees a city becoming unaffordable for its residents. At a commuter rail station one May morning, the Chelsea community development director points down the block to a housing complex with hundreds of apartments with granite kitchen counters and stainless steel appliances fetching over $2,500 in monthly rent — expensive for the historically working class city. “Over the last ten years, there's been about three times the amount of luxury housing built compared to affordable housing,” he said. Train’s goal is to reverse that trend in Chelsea and build more mixed-income housing complexes to ensure there are affordable apartments for current residents to stay in the area. But in other Massachusetts towns and cities, officials say more expensive housing is exactly what they need to revitalize their downtowns and boost their local economies. “We need folks to come into Fitchburg that have higher incomes,” said Liz Murphy, the Central Massachusetts city’s community development director. “We struggle to have those higher-end units for [them].”Fitchburg and Chelsea’s conflicting priorities illustrate the complex challenges state officials face as they search for solutions to a housing shortage that has caused prices to surge and people to relocate to other states. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to development. This has prompted Gov. Maura Healey’s administration to stress that Massachusetts needs all types of housing — both affordable and market rate. Officials are trying to tailor policy and state financing for housing development to meet communities’ different needs. Still, housing advocates caution that with state housing resources finite, using a higher percentage of taxpayer money to incentivize the development of apartments and homes for wealthier people raises equity concerns when that funding could instead go toward rental assistance and more housing for lower-income residents. There’s also the risk that any additional construction of high-end housing fuels a runaway train of increasing home prices in more Massachusetts cities. “Location, location, location” is a phrase real estate insiders use often, and it helps explain why communities’ housing needs can be so conflicting. Boston’s housing market has had a radiating impact on nearby cities for years. As housing prices in the state’s largest city continue to increase, renters have increasingly flocked to nearby communities like Chelsea, where apartments have historically been less expensive. Developers have followed, building new apartment complexes and raising rent to meet the growing demand. The increasingly hot housing market in Chelsea squeezes out the lower-income people that have traditionally made the city a working-class community. Median rents and homelessness in Chelsea are at record highs, and city officials say over half of renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on housing and utilities. A similar dynamic is playing out in cities like Lynn, Somerville and Worcester, where longtime residents are increasingly moving out because they can no longer afford housing. Worcester native Mallory Shelly, whose mother, sister and brother have all left the city in search of less expensive housing, said the influx of higher-end development feels invasive. “The rich people are taking over,” Shelly said as she walked around the city’s downtown and Canal District, where thousands of high-priced luxury housing units have opened in recent years. “It feels like a parasite.” By comparison, smaller post-industrial cities that are farther away from Boston haven’t experienced these same forces. Once factories shut down in the 1900s, Fitchburg and Holyoke became economically depressed as businesses closed and people moved away. Today, both cities have begun to rebound, but they still have vacant properties and office space that can be converted into housing. Liz Murphy, Fitchburg’s community development director, said although her city can use more affordable apartments, there’s already a concentration of them around downtown. She wants to see new housing in that area for people with higher incomes who are moving into Fitchburg. “[Those families] support our economy, and our local economy provides local jobs to folks that are already in the community,” Murphy said. Recent disagreement over an obscure state housing financing program exemplifies the challenges that come with trying to tailor state policy to meet cities’ distinct needs. Massachusetts’ 26 post-industrial Gateway Cities are eligible for housing construction funding via the Housing Development Incentive Program. The program provides tax incentives to developers who build market-rate units.When developers build housing, they usually take out loans for construction and repay the debt with future rental income. But average rents in some Gateway Cities tend to be lower, which squeezes developers’ profits, leaving them less willing to take on certain projects. The HDIP subsidy is meant to make up for that and fuel more investment in Gateway Cities. In an effort to boost housing production, Healey has proposed expanding the HDIP program by lifting its $10 million annual cap to $57 million in the first year and $30 million in subsequent years. The proposal, which state lawmakers are still considering, has set off a statewide debate over whether the HDIP program should be altered to also finance affordable housing development. Leaders of most Gateway Cities and some developers reject any type of modification that would force HDIP projects to include affordable apartments, arguing that it could stifle housing production because income-restricted units are often more expensive to finance. “If you think there’s a public good to having 26 thriving downtowns across the commonwealth — and not just Boston, Cambridge and Somerville — then HDIP’s a very modest investment to make that happen,” said Andre Leroux, a director with the nonpartisan think tank MassINC. But Alexander Train, the development director for Chelsea, believes the HDIP program does need to be reformed. Without the affordability modification, he said HDIP does nothing to help Gateway Cities like Chelsea, and the state as a whole, address the dearth of income-restricted apartments. Train and Judith Liben, a housing attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, noted that HDIP often subsidizes the development of luxury apartments — in some cases, HDIP-financed apartments rent for more than $4,500 a month. Train noted that when HDIP buildings come online and charge higher rents in a city, landlords of nearby existing apartments raise their rents in response. “Worcester is the poster child,” Liben said, noting that Massachusetts’ second-largest city has become a primary recipient of HDIP funds after struggling to attract development for years. “It’s not just Worcester, but Worcester is extreme.” Worcester officials have agreed housing prices are rising, and say they’re taking steps to create more affordable housing. Still, housing advocates add that using state money to facilitate the construction of market-rate homes is inherently inequitable. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Massachusetts needs more than 175,000 housing units for its lowest-income residents. Activists and some local officials argue that when the state subsidizes market-rate housing development for wealthier people, there’s less funding available to help build more affordable housing.“We simply cannot afford to spend $30 million of our annual State housing dollars, equal to one-fifth of the current year’s housing capital budget, on market-rate housing,” Worcester City Councilor Etel Hawhiaj tweeted earlier in June. In an interview, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll acknowledged the concerns about building more market-rate housing. She said the state already allocates hundreds of millions dollars annually to support more affordable housing development and rental assistance. Still, in order to best meet communities’ different housing needs and address Massachusetts’ housing crisis, Driscoll said the state must find a right balance between the construction of more market-rate and affordable housing. “We don't have enough housing to meet the demand,” she said. “That is requiring us to really be a lot more thoughtful about the strategies we can put in place in all of our communities to build the type of housing we need.”",Local,"Tue, 20 Jun 2023 05:00:01 EST",b7a71f6616f90ae9bf728a28eca938c8
7651,Dave Epstein Forecast: Expect a mixed bag of precipitation,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/22/dave-epstein-forecast-expect-a-mixed-bag-of-precipitation,It's not out of the question that we could see all four major precipitation types within 30 miles.,"You likely noticed the clouds have been increasing today, and this trend will continue through sunset leading to precipitation this evening. I expect a mixed bag to arrive between 5 and 8 p.m., moving from west to east. Somewhere around 6 or 7 p.m., precipitation should be heading into the greater Boston area.The type of precipitation you’ll see will depend on where you are. This is a very marginal situation in terms of precipitation type. It's not out of the question that we could see all four major precipitation types within 30 miles. The reason for the kitchen sink version of weather is a warm tongue of air pushing in at high levels of the atmosphere this evening. This will help create the lift necessary for snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain but will also make forecasting the exact type difficult.The trend overnight will be for the precipitation to transition to rain in all but the most northern areas. Before this happens we could see anywhere from a coating to a couple of inches of slop. If you're traveling, because temperatures will be within a few degrees of freezing, road conditions can change quickly. But I don't expect major issues.Tomorrow there will be a sharp contrast in temperature across southern New England. The map below shows readings in the lower 20s west of Route 128, but still in the lower 30s south of Boston. This type of setup can evolve into icy conditions fairly quickly as temperatures drop rapidly. Do not underestimate how quickly roads can become icy with even just a small amount of glaze.The risk for icing continues Thursday night with some additional light precipitation. You should be careful stepping out Friday morning as walkways could be icy. Again, this is not a major situation by any means. But untreated surfaces can become very hazardous with the thinnest of coatings. On Friday readings should get above freezing in greater Boston as sunshine returns.It becomes quite cold for Saturday morning with readings in the single digits west of the city. It will only reach the 20s Saturday afternoon. There could be a few snow showers on Sunday and it will not be as cold. There may be another messy weather system before we conclude February. Winter may not have been bad so far, but it isn’t over yet.",Local,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 13:42:48 EST",baad33b573aa6bf100464d1435badac1
4177,Boston redistricting challenge kicks off in federal court,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/28/boston-redistricting-challenge-kicks-off-in-federal-court,At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty takes the stand for three hours as a witness.,"The process that yielded Boston’s latest voting map was both a strategy to protect incumbents and a “racial diluting” of the city’s long-held majority-minority seat in Mattapan, At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty testified in federal court Tuesday.His comments came during the opening hearing of the case challenging the legality of the voting map approved by the council and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last November.Flaherty, who is in his 20th year on the Boston City Council, argued fellow councilors who ultimately approved the map were less experienced with the redistricting process and wrongly focused on racial demographics. “We’re here today because people disregarded the advice of professional experts,” Flaherty proclaimed, pointing to a memo drafted by Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and adjunct professor at New York Law School. The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including “population equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.”“[The council’s] primary objective,” Flaherty argued, was “population balancing” — which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city’s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city’s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. “We didn’t need to do anything else,” he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council’s “rushed” adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.""I need to have this done by the end of April?"" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty’s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston’s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.“This case is ultimately about choices,” said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made “modest” changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city’s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city’s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city’s redistricting committee amid last year’s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday’s hearing and said his colleague’s testimony illustrated “just how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.”“I think it’s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs … and I think it’s pretty clear at this point that there’s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,"" he said. The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday.",Politics,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:32:10 EST",1ef343cc378be0db19c68c6b3ff0f19a

Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.“Fare-free buses are better buses”, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. “It really does add up, especially for lower income households.""The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered “transit critical,” meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds. “These routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,” Franklin-Hodge said. “If there’s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it’s the people who need it most.""While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders. “I go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it’s on a straight route,” one rider who participated in a focus group said. “The 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister’s house.”A recent GBH news report analyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.“It reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,” Franklin-Hodge said. “We have video. You can see, at some of the big stations … the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.”The fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It’s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future — and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.“Where can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?” Franklin-Hodge said. “We’re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.”",Local,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 13:18:07 EST",8f48ec1e9d51a18a105fbbcb96aa8b6d
1204,Cannabis Control Commission adopts new approach to licensing social consumption sites,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/22/cannabis-control-commission-adopts-new-approach-to-licensing-social-consumption-sites,Commissioners said their vote would remove a barrier to launching marijuana cafes.,"The state’s Cannabis Control Commission on Monday took a step its members said would help streamline the process for getting cannabis cafes and marijuana lounges up and running in Massachusetts.The commission voted to scrap a pilot program that would initially limit social consumption establishments — places where people can buy marijuana products and use them on-site — to 12 communities. Commissioner Bruce Stebbins said the pilot program would involve a “burdensome and expensive” process, and that by eliminating it, the commission could instead focus on developing a broader licensing framework for all social consumption sites.“Our suggestion is, if you want us to go and work on the pilot program, that's step one and that will take an extended period of time,” Stebbins said. “We're saying, right now, to help direct our work, we don't feel that the pilot program is needed as it's written.”Stebbins and Commissioner Nurys Camargo lead a Cannabis Control Commission working group exploring issues around social consumption. Camargo said that instead of a pilot program, there are many other steps the commission can take to ease opening cafes and lounges, including working with cities and towns interested in hosting one of the new businesses. ""That's going to allow our licensees to start thinking, 'Hey, I do want to go to this town, I don't want to go to this town,'"" she said. Four commission members voted to do away with the pilot. The fifth commissioner, Kimberly Roy, voted present, saying she wanted to know more about public health, public safety and equity impacts. The 2016 ballot question that legalized adult marijuana use in Massachusetts envisioned social consumption sites, but more than six years later, those locations are not yet a reality. The commission wrote the pilot program into its regulations in 2019. Since then, the panel’s membership has shifted to a new slate of commissioners, the Massachusetts marijuana industry has continued to grow, and state lawmakers passed a package of cannabis reforms including, among other measures, a process for cities and towns to opt-in to allowing social consumption sites. Ahead of Monday's meeting, the Equitable Opportunities Now coalition sent a letter to the commission, asking its members to ""set aside the social consumption pilot program in the interest of avoiding overly burdensome regulations, removing artificial and unnecessary barriers, respecting local control, advancing the commission's licensing prerogative, and providing clarity to potential entrepreneurs from disparately harmed communities and their potential host communities.""The letter said the pilot would create uncertainty for potential operators of social use sites, ""artificially"" limit the number of communities that could host the establishments, and empower the commission ""to pick winners and losers.""""We look forward to working together to ensure that this exciting new license type creates meaningful opportunities for communities most harmed by the war on drugs,"" Armani White, the coalition's public policy co-chair, said in a statement after the vote. With the pilot program now off the table, Camargo said commissioners are inviting public outreach on social consumption before it dives into the formal regulatory process. She said they'll talk to officials from other states where marijuana is legal and host listening sessions, including a virtual one coming up in June.",Politics,"Mon, 22 May 2023 16:48:12 EST",2e0a2d50059b42edff5082134bad3c2d
1047,Construction firm pushes OSHA to train workers on mental health and suicide prevention,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/03/construction-firm-pushes-osha-to-train-workers-on-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention,CDC data shows construction has the second highest rate of suicide among all industries.,"Boston-based Suffolk Construction, one of the largest construction firms in the country, wants to make mental health and suicide prevention training mandatory for workers.The construction industry has the second highest rates of suicide deaths in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Industry leaders say the COVID-19 pandemic and economy have added even more pressures on workers and resulted in higher rates of substance abuse, adding urgency for the industry to address mental health.Suffolk CEO John Fish, along with retired Brig. Gen. Jack Hammond, who is the executive director of the veterans' wellness nonprofit Home Base in Charlestown, sent a joint letter Tuesday to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, asking that suicide awareness and prevention be made a core training requirement for all workers.“Our collective goal as an industry should be for every worker to return home to their families each day,” they wrote in the letter. “It is our job as industry leaders to train, support and educate our workers on the symptoms of mental illness and identifying suicide risk factors, which should be taken as seriously as any jobsite risk. The time is now to rally our entire industry to address this dire issue.”According to the most recent job-specific suicide data from the CDC, 45 out of every 100,000 male construction workers die by suicide, compared to a national average of 14. That means that a man working in construction is 3.5 times more likely to take his own life than the general public. Female construction workers also die by suicide at a higher than average rate, with nine out of 100,000 female construction workers dying compared to the national average of eight. Only the mining, quarrying and gas and oil extraction industry has a higher rate of suicide.“Ultimately, at the end of the day, the worst thing that happens is that a construction worker takes their own life,” said Suffolk’s National Chief Operating Officer Tim Stroud.Stroud held a panel discussion Tuesday at Suffolk's auditorium to address mental health awareness. All employees within Suffolk field operations, and internal and external resource groups and functions that support construction operations were invited to attend. The purpose of the event, Stroud said, was to focus on regional needs on construction site awareness, safety awareness, and raising the level of the culture and engagement on construction sites. Stroud said the goal is to shed light on the issue during Safety Week, an annual weeklong event when larger construction firms across the country focus on safety programming at work sites, mental health issues, and factors that impair a worker’s judgment. “We know that in this industry there are folks that show up for work in any given day that are not in the right mental state to be able to perform their duties safely and efficiently.”The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health issues, and construction industry insiders noted that also led to an increase in substance abuse with alcohol and drugs. “A lot of what we're doing, particularly with substance abuse, whether it's drugs and alcohol use, is through what we call peer-to-peer training,” he said. “We are making our members, rank and file members, aware of the signs to look for, and that some of that incorporates suicide prevention.”Frank Callahan, CEO and president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Unions, represents 75,000 men and women in the building trades who work across the construction industry. The MBTU has taken in more than 1,100 veterans into apprenticeship and enrolled them in their Helmets to Hardhats jobs training program. Callahan said some veterans continue to struggle with issues related to their service, but that the MBTU provides great benefits including pension and health insurance plans.Callahan noted that during difficult economic times, people get depressed and incidents of suicide go up. He added that construction is a male-dominated industry, and men don’t often seek out help. He said his organization is taking steps to address the problem.“Whether it's mental health, whether it's substance abuse or suicide, we're working on the stigma to destigmatize both. And once you get by the stigma that there are resources available,"" Callahan said. “You shouldn't be ashamed or embarrassed to come forward, and through the strength of our health insurance programs, there are resources available to you.”According to a Suffolk spokesperson, OSHA’s Douglas Parker responded to Fish and Hammond’s letter and said he appreciated the efforts, and that OSHA would keep pressing the issue.",Local,"Wed, 03 May 2023 12:01:46 EST",355c4229d768ad2aecf857a4e10ef667

It must be prevented.""","If you're one of the millions of people who've seen Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" in theaters over the last couple of weeks, then you got a small peek at the destructive power of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 6 and 9, 1945. Since the bombings 78 years ago, the number of nuclear weapons and their power have increased dramatically. Last week, a group of top medical experts published an editorial in over 100 medical journals calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons because of the risk they pose to human survival. GBH's All Things Considered guest host Judie Yuill spoke with one of the editorials authors, Dr. Ira Helfand. Helfand is also co-founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and a member of the International Steering Group of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Judie Yuill: Can you tell us a little more about the points you make in the editorial and why you and the other authors felt that now is the time to bring attention to the dangers of nuclear war? Dr. Ira Helfand: Yeah, I think we were motivated by our growing concern that the danger of nuclear war is increasing dramatically, both because of the war in Ukraine, but also because of other developments. The unstable situation in Korea, the rising tension between the United States and China, which could lead to nuclear war over Taiwan, and the ongoing conflict on an almost daily basis between India and Pakistan, which could also escalate to nuclear war. We're also motivated by the new information that has become available to the scientific community over the last year about just how devastating a nuclear war would be. A study published last summer in the journal Nature Food showed that even a limited war between India and Pakistan could cause enough climate disruption to trigger a famine that would kill 2 billion people, including 130 million here in the United States, and end civilization as we know it. A full-scale war between the United States and Russia would kill over 5 billion people. Yuill: So it's very important for the medical community to raise awareness of this risk. Helfand: Exactly. This is the greatest threat to public health in the world today. And the medical community has two responsibilities. One is to alert people to this danger in the hopes that they will take action and do something to eliminate the danger. Secondly, to advise and make clear to the general public that in the event that nuclear war happens, there is nothing that the medical community can do to alleviate the suffering that will result. Yuill: Well, there probably is expectation that the medical community would step up and do something. Helfand: That's right. And the medical community and the International Committee of the Red Cross have been clear for decades that that is not the case, that nuclear war is something which cannot be treated after the fact. It must be prevented. Yuill: With over 100 medical journals publishing this editorial and a very long list of authors, it seems like this call to action involved a lot of collaboration. How did that come together? Helfand: The project was initiated by Dr. Andrew Haines in the United Kingdom, who thought that it was really important for the medical community to speak out again at this moment. He reached out to the editors of several of the journals and to several other people in the leadership of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. It came together actually quite quickly because there was a great consensus amongst all of us that the moment absolutely demanded this kind of response from the medical community. Yuill: I've heard other people speculate that we could be closer to nuclear war now than maybe we ever have been. You seem to be indicating that's true. How worried should we be about it? Helfand: I think we should be very worried. I think we are closer than we have ever been. Experts like former Defense Secretary William Perry have been telling us this since 2018, well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has increased the danger even more. We are essentially heading towards a nuclear war if we do not begin to act very differently. One of the biggest parts of the problem is that we are not acting as though we are facing this kind of danger. The general population back in the 1980s understood the danger of nuclear war, and millions of people became active and they brought about fundamental change in U.S. and Soviet nuclear policy. We don't have that kind of understanding yet today, and that's part of what we were trying to achieve with this editorial, which is being published, as you know, by more than 100 journals. This is itself an extraordinary development. Medical journals are usually very concerned not to publish anything that has been published anywhere else before. The fact that all of these journals have agreed to publish the same piece indicates how strongly they feel about the danger and how urgent they feel it is that people take action. Yuill: Are you saying that people have become complacent? Helfand: I think they have forgotten about the nuclear danger. People of my generation, people who lived through the Cold War in the early '80s have really put this out of mind, and younger people have never been taught about it. When you talk to college students and high school students today, they really have never been given the basic information about what nuclear war would involve and so they don't understand. They don't know that this is a problem they need to be concerned about when they hear about it. They're appropriately upset as they are about the climate crisis and they react in the same way they have to the climate crisis, which is to want to do something to eliminate this danger. Yuill: So what would you recommend that civilians do to reduce the risk of nuclear war? Helfand: Well, here in the United States, we have launched a campaign called Back From the Brink, which seeks to bring about fundamental change in U.S. nuclear policy. It calls on the United States to recognize that nuclear weapons do not make us safe, that they are the greatest threat to our safety and to our survival. And of course, in the United States, to begin now to negotiate with all eight of the other countries that have nuclear weapons for a verifiable, enforceable, time bound agreement to eliminate their arsenals so that all of these countries will be able to join together in supporting the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. None of them are willing to disarm unilaterally, but if they can negotiate this kind of an agreement amongst themselves, they can bring about universal nuclear disarmament, which is what we need. So the Back From the Brink campaign is focused on getting resolutions passed and cities and towns and getting organizations around the country to endorse this call for negotiations to end the nuclear weapons era. We also have a resolution before the United States House of Representatives, H. Res. 77, which was introduced by Congressman Jim McGovern and is also sponsored by Congressman Pressley and Congressman Neal. We need to get the entire delegation in Congress to support this resolution, and we need to get our senators, Senator Markey and Senator Warren, to introduce a companion resolution in the United States Senate. This is perhaps the most dramatic way we have of illustrating the need for the elimination of nuclear weapons and for mobilizing champions in Congress to carry this banner forward. There's no guarantee that this process will be successful, even if we convinced the United States to reach out to Russia and China and the other nuclear weapon states. They may say they're not interested, but there's no reason to assume that because we've never tried this. So that's what we should do. We should reach out and hope for the best. If the initiative fails, we are back in the same position we're in right now, which is a very bad place to be, but things are no worse, which is to say there's absolutely nothing to lose by trying. Yuill: Thank you so much for joining us. Helfand: Thank you, Judie. It's been a pleasure talking with you.",International News,"Wed, 09 Aug 2023 15:53:56 EST",8febb85f151b832d48c74904c0a54d90

4604,Massachusetts US Attorney Rachael Rollins to resign after Justice Department ethics probe,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/16/massachusetts-us-attorney-rachael-rollins-to-resign-after-justice-department-ethics-probe,The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation.,"Updated May 16 at 5:29 p.m.BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins will resign following a monthslong investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general into her appearance at a political fundraiser and other potential ethics issues, her attorney said Tuesday.The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation, but an attorney for Rollins told The Associated Press that she will be submitting a letter of resignation to President Joe Biden by close of business Friday.The resignation of a U.S. attorney amid ethics concerns is an exceedingly rare phenomenon and is especially notable for a Justice Department that under Attorney General Merrick Garland has sought to restore a sense of normalcy and good governance following the turbulent four years of the Trump administration.Rollins' attorney said she has been “profoundly honored” to have serve as U.S. attorney and proud of her office's work but “understands that her presence has become a distraction.” Attorney Michael Bromwich — a former Justice Department inspector general — said Rollins will make herself available to answer questions “after the dust settles and she resigns.”""The work of the office and the Department of Justice is far too important to be overshadowed by anything else,” Bromwich said.The Justice Department didn't immediately comment Tuesday. The inspector general's office declined to comment.Rollins was a controversial pick to be Massachusetts’ top federal law enforcer and twice needed Vice President Kamala Harris to break a tie for her nomination to move forward in the Senate amid fierce opposition from Republicans, who painted her as a radical.Before taking the high-profile U.S. attorney job, she was the top prosecutor for Suffolk County, which includes Boston. In her role there, sparred with Boston’s largest police union and pushed ambitious criminal justice changes, most notably a policy not to prosecute certain low-level crimes such as shoplifting.She was the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts and the first Black woman to become U.S. attorney for the state.The Associated Press was the first to report in November that the inspector general’s office had opened an investigation into Rollins over her appearance last year at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser featuring first lady Jill Biden. The inspector general’s office generally investigates allegations of fraud, abuse or violation of other Justice Department policies.People familiar with the investigation told the AP at the time that the probe had expanded into other areas, including Rollins’ use of her personal cellphone to conduct Justice Department business and a trip she took to California that was paid for by an outside group.The inspector general’s office scrutiny into Rollins began after she was photographed last July arriving at a home in Andover, Massachusetts, where the DNC fundraiser with Jill Biden was held. That was according to two people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the probe.Rollins said in a July tweet that she “had approval” to meet the first lady and left the event early to speak at two community events. One person familiar with discussions before that event told the AP that Rollins was only given limited permission to meet Jill Biden outside the home.Rollins acknowledged the investigation during a December meeting with reporters, saying she doesn’t want her office to be “distracted” by the probe.“I certainly think any time there’s an investigation into anyone — and I’ve been the chief law enforcement officer in two different roles — it impacts you for sure,” Rollins said at the time.The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, another federal watchdog agency, has also been investigating whether Rollins’ attendance at the fundraiser violated the Hatch Act, a law that limits political activity by government workers. The status of that investigation is unclear.In addition to probing the fundraiser appearance, the inspector general’s office copied the phone contents of some employees in Rollins’ office as part of their probe into her possible use of her personal phone for Justice Department business, one person familiar with the matter told the AP last year.The inspector general also examined a trip Rollins took to California that was paid for by an outside group, even though Justice Department employees are not supposed to accept payments for travel. The trip was for CAA Amplify, the annual gathering of entertainment, business and political figures run by one of Hollywood’s leading talent agencies, the Creative Artists Agency.___Tucker reported from Washington.___This story has been corrected to reflect that Rollins was the first Black woman, not the first Black person, to serve as Massachusetts U.S. attorney.",Politics,"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:43:33 EST",dcabeff4b25e3e5d5f154c329ecfc13a
2030,5 things to know about the latest charges against Donald Trump,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/02/5-things-to-know-about-the-latest-charges-against-donald-trump,Former President Donald Trump was indicted Tuesday on charges he participated in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results — an effort that reached a bloody crescendo as his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021.,"Former President Donald Trump was indicted Tuesday on charges he participated in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results — an effort that reached a bloody crescendo as his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021.Following an investigation by special counsel Jack Smith, a grand jury voted to charge Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, witness tampering and conspiracy against the rights of citizens, and obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding.Trump, who has been summoned to appear in court on Thursday, is still the leading candidate in the Republican primary race. If he pleads not guilty (as he has with the other indictments), we could be hearing about his trial as he makes his case for the White House.Here are five key points to help get you up to speed.1. This is the third criminal indictment for Trump, but it's more than just another legal woeThe former president now faces legal peril in three criminal cases — following March's indictment on 34 counts of falsifying business records and June's indictment on 37 counts of mishandling classified documents. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases.A prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga., is leading a separate investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to pressure state election officials there. And Trump is also fighting two civil lawsuits, including a federal jury finding that left him liable for battery and defamation.But this latest indictment stands apart from Trump's other legal challenges.The Department of Justice's investigation into Jan. 6, 2021, is among the most sprawling and complex in U.S. history — it gets at the heart of the alleged effort to overturn legitimate election results and obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.""The attack on our nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy,"" said the special counsel in a short statement before reporters. ""As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies. Lies by the defendant, targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government.""2. The latest charges represent significant legal perilThe indictment charges Trump with four serious federal criminal offenses:conspiracy to defraud the United States applies to Trump's repeated and widespread efforts to spread false claims about the November 2020 election while knowing they were not true and for allegedly attempting to illegally discount legitimate votes all with the goal of overturning the 2020 election, prosecutors claim in the indictment.Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding was brought due to the alleged organized planning of Trump and his allies to disrupt the electoral vote's certification in January 2021.obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding is tied to Trump and his co-defendants' actual efforts after the November 2020 election until Jan. 7, 2021 to block the official certification proceeding in Congress.conspiracy against rights is a Civil War-era law that applies to Trump and his co-conspirators' alleged attempts to ""oppress, threaten and intimidate"" people in their right to vote in an election.University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias described the overall case against former President Donald Trump ""damning"" and representing real ""legal jeopardy.""3. The indictment lists six anonymous co-conspiratorsFormer President Trump is the only person who is charged and he is the only defendant in this latest indictment. But the court document scatters some clues for the future in terms of who else might could potentially face charges.There are six people labeled as co-conspirators in the indictment. They are given individual numbers and potentially identifying traits but they are not identified by name in the court document.Some are attorneys who helped promote bogus election fraud claims. Co-conspirator 3 is described as an attorney who privately acknowledged the unfounded election fraud claims were ""crazy."" Another, co-conspirator 4, was a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and ""attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures.""And their descriptions line up with that of people who could be of interest to investigators, such as former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Sidney Powell, and former DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark.4. Trump is calling this indictment ""fake."" And, yes, he's still leading the pollsEven before the indictment was unsealed, Donald Trump and his allies were actively working to control the narrative, calling this a sham indictment and accusing the Biden administration of trying to interfere with the 2024 election.On Truth Social, Trump said a ""Fake Indictment"" was evidence of ""prosecutorial misconduct."" His campaign issued a formal statement (and, later, a fund-raising pitch) calling it ""election interference."" And his Republican allies in Congress — plus even some of his GOP primary foes — cast the indictment as political persecution at the hands of the Biden administration.But as NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez pointed out in an interview with All Things Considered, the attacks from Trump and his supporters are focusing on the process — not so much the substance.""They claim these are politically motivated charges. They attack the special counsel. But they don't necessarily refute specific allegations,"" Ordoñez said. ""They don't argue Trump never incited those followers who attacked the Capitol. They never say that Trump didn't seek a group of fake electors.""That's because, after two impeachments, three indictments and quite a few scandals in between, Trump has conditioned his supporters to see each allegation against him as a reason to rally around him.And it works. In March, several weeks before the first indictment, Trump had just 43% of the vote in Republican polling, according to a RealClearPolitics average. But a day after he was charged in a hush-money scheme to an adult film actress, his numbers had jumped to 50%.Two months later, he was indicted for mishandling classified documents. His polling average jumped again.As of Monday, ahead of the news of the latest indictment, Trump was still in the lead. 5. Charges for 2020 election interference are starting to pile upThe federal indictment of Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election came soon after similar election interference charges were made public against a Trump ally in Michigan.Matthew DePerno — the most recent Republican nominee for Michigan attorney general, who worked with Trump's team to try to contest his 2020 loss in the state — was arraigned Tuesday on state charges for an alleged effort to unlawfully gain access to voting machines.DePerno has been charged with undue possession of a voting machine, willfully damaging a voting machine and conspiracy, according to the special prosecutor investigating the case.Investigations into election interference are ongoing elsewhere, as well. Arizona's Democratic attorney general is investigating the 2020 fake electors there, and a Georgia prosecutor is set to soon announce her long-awaited charging decisions in an investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election there.And all of these investigations are happening separately to the Justice Department's sprawling and complex investigation into the events of Jan. 6, 2021.On that day, Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, injuring scores of law enforcement officers, forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation's political leaders and threatening the peaceful transfer of power after Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.To date, the DOJ has charged over 1,000 people in what's become the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history.That list now includes Trump.NPR's Ben Swasey and Carrie Johnson contributed reporting.

319,"20 years after the US invaded Iraq, Rep. Seth Moulton reflects on Washington's decisions",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/20/20-years-after-the-us-invaded-iraq-rep-seth-moulton-reflects-on-washingtons-decisions,"""When you fight a war, a lot of people die and they're very young,” he said.","On March 20, 2003, Rep. Seth Moulton was a 24-year-old U.S. Marine in Kuwait, called into his commander’s tent at 3 a.m. to hear the news: The U.S. was invading Iraq. Rumors had been circulating among troops in the run-up, with Moulton’s fellow lieutenants taking bets over whether then-President George W. Bush would order the invasion. “I said, 'No, Bush isn't really going to do this,'” Moulton told GBH’s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel Monday. “I lost that bet. It's not the only bet in my life that I've lost.”When Moulton’s commander called him into his tent in the middle of the night, he introduced him to two new troops that would be joining his platoon. Both of them were 17, right out of training, he said. “It's just a reminder of just how amazingly young our troops are, so many of them, and we put so many burdens on their shoulders,” Moulton said. “That's what we do every time we go to war.”Two decades later Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq before being elected to Congress, said he has many takeaways and complicated feelings about the invasion. An estimated 275,000 to 306,000 Iraqi civilians died in violence related to the war between 2003 and 2019, according to data from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University. More than 16,000 Iraqi troops and 4,431 US troops were also killed. “I think there was some real flawed decision-making when it came to the decision to invade in the first place,” he said. “The Iraqis were thrilled that we had rid them of this tyrant of a dictator. But then in the next phase, we failed to dedicate the resources and the smart decision-making to actually reconstruct the country and build a democracy. There were bright moments of success, but also many a failure.”Moulton said he believes the initial military invasion went well, but that the U.S. military withdrew too quickly under former President Barack Obama. “But on the other hand, the surge was actually successful at restoring order to the country. It was a good example of how counterinsurgencies can actually succeed,” he said. “It's a complicated history, and I think that's exactly what veterans today feel. We have complicated views of the war.” Moulton did not go to Iraq planning a political career, he said. “This was the furthest thing from my mind,” he said. “It wasn't something I studied in school. It wasn't something I was interested in. But over the course of those four tours, I felt like I had seen some of the consequences of failed leadership in Washington. And in fact, there was even a day when a corporal in my platoon came up to me — it was the end of a rather difficult day — and he said, ‘You know, sir, you ought to run for Congress someday so that this stuff doesn't happen again.’""Two decades after the invasion, Moulton said the U.S. is not serving the veterans who have returned from Iraq. “There are a lot of veterans who are homeless, who don't have opportunities back here, who literally risked their lives for the country but don't have the opportunities that many other Americans do,” he said. “There is a lot more that we need to do. But it's encouraging that the Congress is working in a bipartisan way to get this done. It's one of the few places where you see Democrats and Republicans coming together on both sides of the aisle.”Decisions to send U.S. troops to war should be made with great care, Moulton said. “I think the most important thing is we have to make these decisions very carefully, and they shouldn't be politicized,” he said. “There's a lot of people playing politics right now with the war in Ukraine. You got Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right extremists essentially spouting Kremlin talking points. You've got other people who are just flying their Ukrainian flags without much idea of what that means or what's going on on the ground.”That brings him back to his 24-year-old self, and the two 17-year-olds who joined his platoon on the eve of the invasion. “The point I bring this back to is that when you fight a war, a lot of people die and they're very young,” he said. “And I think that remembering the people who are involved in war is one of the most important things that we can do.”",Politics,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 11:43:21 EST",153a9ec35653d0ddd84d788750b61bf0

2923,"Tina Turner, 'Queen of Rock 'n' Roll' whose triumphant career made her world-famous, dies at 83",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/24/tina-turner-queen-of-rock-n-roll-whose-triumphant-career-made-her-world-famous-dies-at-83,She sold more than 150 million records worldwide and won 12 Grammys.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Tina Turner, the unstoppable singer and stage performer who teamed with husband Ike Turner for a dynamic run of hit records and live shows in the 1960s and ‘70s and survived her horrifying marriage to triumph in middle age with the chart-topping ""What's Love Got to Do With It,"" has died at 83.Turner died Tuesday, after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, Switzerland, according to her manager. She became a Swiss citizen a decade ago.Few stars traveled so far — she was born Anna Mae Bullock in a segregated Tennessee hospital and spent her latter years on a 260,000 square foot estate on Lake Zurich — and overcame so much. Physically battered, emotionally devastated and financially ruined by her 20-year relationship with Ike Turner, she became a superstar on her own in her 40s, at a time when most of her peers were on their way down, and remained a top concert draw for years after.""How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and trauma and used it as a means to help change the world?"" Angela Bassett, who played Turner in the 1993 biopic “What's Love Got to Do With It,” said in a statement.""Through her courage in telling her story, her commitment to stay the course in her life, no matter the sacrifice, and her determination to carve out a space in rock and roll for herself and for others who look like her, Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like.With admirers ranging from Mick Jagger to Beyoncé to Mariah Carey, the “Queen of Rock 'n' Roll” was one of the world's most popular entertainers, known for a core of pop, rock and rhythm and blues favorites: ""Proud Mary,"" ""Nutbush City Limits,"" ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" and the hits she had in the '80s, among them ""What's Love Got to Do with It,"" ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" and a cover of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together.""Her trademarks included a growling contralto that might smolder or explode, her bold smile and strong cheekbones, her palette of wigs and the muscular, quick-stepping legs she did not shy from showing off. She sold more than 150 million records worldwide, won 12 Grammys, was voted along with Ike into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 (and on her own in 2021 ) and was honored at the Kennedy Center in 2005, with Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey among those praising her. Her life became the basis for a film, a Broadway musical and an HBO documentary in 2021 that she called her public farewell.Until she left her husband and revealed their back story, she was known as the voracious on-stage foil of the steady-going Ike, the leading lady of the “Ike and Tina Turner Revue.” Ike was billed first and ran the show, choosing the material, the arrangements, the backing singers. They toured constantly for years, in part because Ike was often short on money and unwilling to miss a concert. Tina Turner was forced to go on with bronchitis, with pneumonia, with a collapsed right lung.Other times, the cause of her misfortunes was Ike himself.As she recounted in her memoir, “I, Tina,” Ike began hitting her not long after they met, in the mid-1950s, and only grew more vicious. Provoked by anything and anyone, he would throw hot coffee in her face, choke her, or beat her until her eyes were swollen shut, then rape her. Before one show, he broke her jaw and she went on stage with her mouth full of blood.Terrified both of being with Ike and of lasting without him, she credited her emerging Buddhist faith in the mid-1970s with giving her a sense of strength and self-worth and she finally left in early July 1976. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue was scheduled to open a tour marking the country’s bicentennial when Tina snuck out of their Dallas hotel room, with just a Mobil credit card and 36 cents, while Ike slept. She hurried across a nearby highway, narrowly avoiding a speeding truck, and found another hotel.“I looked at him (Ike) and thought, ‘You just beat me for the last time, you sucker,’” she recalled in her memoir.Turner was among the first celebrities to speak candidly about domestic abuse, becoming a heroine to battered women and a symbol of resilience to all. Ike Turner did not deny mistreating her, although he tried to blame Tina for their troubles. When he died, in 2007, a representative for his ex-wife said simply: “Tina is aware that Ike passed away.”Ike and Tina fans knew little of this during the couple's prime. The Turners were a hot act for much of the 1960s and into the ’70s, evolving from bluesy ballads such as “A Fool in Love” and “It’s Going to Work Out Fine” to flashy covers of “Proud Mary” and “Come Together” and other rock songs that brought them crossover success.They opened for the Rolling Stones in 1966 and 1969, and were seen performing a lustful version of Otis Redding’s “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long” in the 1970 Stones documentary “Gimme Shelter.” Bassett and Laurence Fishburne gave Oscar-nominated performances in “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” based on “I, Tina,” but she would say that reliving her years with Ike was so painful she couldn’t bring herself to watch the movie.Ike and Tina’s reworking of “Proud Mary,” originally a tight, mid-tempo hit for Creedence Clearwater Revival, helped define their sexual aura. Against a background of funky guitar and Ike’s crooning baritone, Tina began with a few spoken words about how some people wanted to hear songs that were “nice and easy.”“But there’s this one thing,” she warned, “you see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy.“We always do it nice — and rough.”But by the end of the 1970s, Turner’s career seemed finished. She was 40 years old, her first solo album had flopped and her live shows were mostly confined to the cabaret circuit. Desperate for work, and money, she even agreed to tour in South Africa when the country was widely boycotted because of its racist apartheid regime.Rock stars helped bring her back. Rod Stewart convinced her to sing “Hot Legs” with him on “Saturday Night Live” and Jagger, who had openly borrowed some of Turner’s on-stage moves, sang “Honky Tonk Women” with her during the Stones’ 1981-82 tour. At a listening party for his 1983 album “Let’s Dance,” David Bowie told guests that Turner was his favorite singer.“She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous,"" Jagger tweeted Wednesday. ""She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her.”More popular in England at the time than in the U.S., she recorded a raspy version of “Let’s Stay Together” at EMI’s Abbey Road studios in London. By the end of 1983, “Let’s Stay Together” was a hit throughout Europe and on the verge of breaking in the states. An A&R man at Capitol Records, John Carter, urged the label to sign her up and make an album. Among the material presented was a reflective pop-reggae ballad co-written by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle and initially dismissed by Tina as “wimpy.”“I just thought it was some old pop song, and I didn’t like it,” she later said of “What’s Love Got To Do With It.”Turner’s “Private Dancer” album came out in May 1984, sold more than eight million copies and featured several hit singles, including the title song and “Better Be Good To Me.” It won four Grammys, among them record of the year for “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” the song that came to define the clear-eyed image of her post-Ike years.“People look at me now and think what a hot life I must have lived — ha!” she wrote in her memoir.Even with Ike, it was hard to mistake her for a romantic. Her voice was never “pretty,” and love songs were never her specialty, in part because she had little experience to draw from. She was born in Nutbush, Tennessee in 1939 and would say she received “no love” from either her mother or father. After her parents separated, she moved often around Tennessee and Missouri, living with various relatives. She was outgoing, loved to sing and as a teenager would check out the blues clubs in St. Louis, where one of the top draws was Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. Tina didn’t care much for his looks the first time she saw him, at the Club Manhattan.“Then he got up onstage and picked up his guitar,” she wrote in her memoir. “He hit one note, and I thought, ‘Jesus, listen to this guy play.’”Tina soon made her move. During intermission at an Ike Turner show at the nearby Club D’Lisa, Ike was alone on stage, playing a blues melody on the keyboards. Tina recognized the song, B.B. King’s “You Know I Love You,” grabbed a microphone and sang along. As Tina remembered, a stunned Ike called out “Giirrlll!!” and demanded to know what else she could perform. Over her mother’s objections, she agreed to join his group. He changed her first name to Tina, inspired by the comic book heroine Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, and changed her last name by marrying her, in 1962.In rare moments of leniency from Ike, Tina did enjoy success on her own. She added a roaring lead vocal to Phil Spector’s titanic production of “River Deep, Mountain High,” a flop in the U.S. when released in 1966, but a hit overseas and eventually a standard. She was also featured as the Acid Queen in the 1975 film version of the Who’s rock opera “Tommy.” More recent film work included “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” and a cameo in “What’s Love Got to Do with It.”Turner had two sons: Craig, with saxophonist Raymond Hill; and Ronald, with Ike Turner. (Craig Turner was found dead in 2018 of an apparent suicide). In a memoir published later in 2018, “Tina Turner: My Love Story,” she revealed that she had received a kidney transplant from her second husband, former EMI record executive Erwin Bach.Turner’s life seemed an argument against marriage, but her life with Bach was a love story the younger Tina would not have believed possible. They met in the mid-1980s, when she flew to Germany for record promotion and he picked her up at the airport. He was more than a decade younger than her — “the prettiest face,” she said of him in the HBO documentary — and the attraction was mutual. She wed Bach in 2013, exchanging vows at a civil ceremony in Switzerland.“It’s that happiness that people talk about,” Turner told the press at the time, “when you wish for nothing, when you can finally take a deep breath and say, ‘Everything is good.’”SeparatorAssociated Press Writer Hilary Fox contributed to this report.",National,"Wed, 24 May 2023 17:49:49 EST",4fadcb9a607f7db141f3a256fed6f77c

During the pandemic, Massachusetts somehow paid out $2.5 billion in unemployment benefits from federal rather than state funds — and now, we may have to pay some or all of that money back.The error has elicited wildly varied responses. The state's all-Democratic congressional delegation is blaming former Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, and urging the feds to come up with a solution that, “minimize[s] the impact on hardworking people and small businesses.” Meanwhile, the state's business community is arguing that it shouldn't be forced to pay extra to cover any repayment. But so far, Gov. Maura Healey, House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka aren't pointing fingers at the Baker administration. They don't seem particularly worried about what the future may hold, either.How does a mistake this massive happen? Why wasn't it caught earlier? And what does the wide range of reactions tell us about Massachusetts' political landscape? Adam Reilly is joined by GBH News State House reporter Katie Lannan and Samuel Gebru, the managing director of Black Lion Strategies and a professor at Tufts University, to discuss.

Rooks shared the story of his nephew from Philadelphia, who was on probation but had a job in New Jersey. He had to quit because his probation officer prevented him from traveling out of state.“Those are the types of decisions that people on probation, parole often have to face. It's just not fair. It's not connected or related to why they're on probation or parole. It's not real accountability. And we've been working to change this all across the country.”Established in 2019, the REFORM Alliance has passed 16 bills in nine different states to change the way probation and parole works in the criminal justice system — states that range from Florida to Louisiana to California.“We are headed to Illinois in two weeks to pass our 17th piece of legislation. Our goal is to reform — transform — our nation's probation and parole system, to be one that moves away from its current trapdoor: from community to prison back to community,” Rooks said. According to Rooks, research indicates that prolonged periods of probation and parole hinder individuals' ability to reintegrate successfully into society. “Just imagine ... you’re out on probation or parole. You have a probation officer that you have to meet with, say, two days a week. ... Meet with your probation officer for an hour. And then you have an education course, sometimes drug education, sometimes it’s another thematic course you have to take for an hour. And then you have curfew at 6 or 6:30,” he said. “Where is someone to work? Where are you able to earn a living?” To address this issue, Rooks and others have been working on removing unnecessary barriers in states like Pennsylvania. Their efforts incentivize going to work or school to shorten the supervision period.“If you're on probation and you're enrolled in school, college or some kind of education program, you get credit to work time off of your probation. If you were working, you would get work credits to work time off of your probation,” he said. The REFORM Alliance was born after artist Meek Mill was reincarcerated for popping wheelies while he was on probation in 2017. A judge found out and sentenced him to two to four years in prison. This spurred the #FreeMeekMill Movement on social media.“It wasn't easy,” Rooks said. “Took six months to get him out. But when he got out, through his credit, [Meek] said, ‘This is not about me. It's about the millions of people on probation and parole all across this country that are free but not free’,”Rooks said. He credits Meek Mill for bringing attention to the issue of probation and parole. “I've been doing this work for 25 years,” Rooks said. “I've worked on sentencing reform. I worked on the death penalty. I worked on the war on drugs. This issue of probation and parole was seen as so technical that many folks in the field just missed. And he brought attention to it, and REFORM was born.” Meek Mill will be part of a panel at the NAACP’s 114th National Convention hosted in Boston, as well as Robert Kraft, who is a founding partner of REFORM and sits on the board. Rook expressed deep admiration for Kraft and how his involvement helps REFORM’s reputation, saying that his involvement lends “tremendous credibility” to the organization. “Everywhere I go across this country, especially in the center part of the country, because we were founded in relation to Meek, much of our membership is on the coast, on the West Coast. But when I go to the center part of the country, guess who people ask about? They ask about Robert Kraft,” Rooks said. He explained that making change to such deeply entrenched systems takes time, especially with the layers of U.S. government bureaucracy. “The beauty and the pain of our great country is that, with something that has been built at the government level, you have to undo it by changing laws at the federal, state and sometimes county level. And that’s what we have in our massive justice system,” Rooks said. “Probation is a form of accountability, and we're not trying to take the accountability away,” he added. “What we are doing is saying that there's a better way to do it and as a way we can incentivize good behaviors.”",Local,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 17:10:27 EST",fc0f64e9a6dd8212610085ded0070c98
3461,Mayor Wu says O'Bryant school move was significantly vetted,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/20/mayor-wu-says-obryant-school-move-was-significantly-vetted,"Mayor Wu told BPR that the O'Bryant School of Math and Science is moving to West Roxbury to expand ""high quality"" school options.","During “Ask the Mayor” on Tuesday, Mayor Michelle Wu answered a wide array of questions from the public. A large portion of the discussion on Boston Public Radio focused on the plan to move the O'Bryant School of Math and Science out of its current home in Roxbury, where it neighbors the Madison Park Vocational Technical School, and into the West Roxbury Educational Complex. “My perception is that there wasn't a lot of transparency in that decision to move,” said caller Donna from Charlestown. “I also am wondering if you might be able to share the rationale.”The plan was first announced to the public in a press conference this June. This came after analysis from school leaders and people involved in the historical development of the school district, Wu said. “There was significant vetting that had to be done about whether this was even a proposal we should consider,” she said.“The bottom line is this: we have two high schools who are battling for space,” said Wu. “The Madison Park Vocational Technical High School and the O'Bryant Math and Science Academy have been jammed into the same complex for multiple decades now.” A few decades ago, Wu explained, there was a movement to create smaller schools with separate K-8 and 9-12 models. Larger high schools were broken down into multiple, smaller schools in the same building or nearby, Wu said. Since that time, enrollment and demographic shifts have the school district moving towards a seventh through twelfth grade model to accommodate growing enrollment in some places. O’Bryant and Madison Park currently share athletic and academic space. The close proximity has limited the STEM offerings at O’Bryant and limited vocational tracks and adult education at Madison Park, Wu said. “Giving each school its own space is really important to tapping into the potential of all of our students,” she said. Additionally, moving would allow O’Bryant to expand its seventh and eighth grade classes, which are currently capped due to space constraints. Wu said there’s benefit to having students join O’Bryant before ninth grade because it lets them acclimate to school culture and form friendships they can carry through high school. Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude asked Wu about the perceptions of moving O’Bryant from a community of color to a primarily white community. Particularly when the MBTA is already struggling with slow zones and access. Wu explained that the exam school admissions process guarantees that every school is already open to students city-wide, from every neighborhood and all socioeconomic backgrounds. The city will also provide dedicated shuttles to West Roxbury. For students coming from East Boston, Wu said the commute “would be the same or even faster than what the students have to do on the T right now.”Wu said the greatest disparities in access and quality of education and instruction in Boston occur after elementary school. “There's a perception and a feeling that you have to walk a very narrow tightrope to get into the right sort of small mix of schools,” she said. But adjusting the lottery system is not the answer — instead, Wu said “every single one of our high school seats has to be a high quality option.”",Local,"Tue, 20 Jun 2023 17:16:30 EST",b5883b63927d8f0fabe5e5bb63d960cf

Elected officials said he's the reason they were voted into office. His family said he was an inspiration to all of them. Trailblazing community activist Melvin ""Mel"" Herbert King was honored by Bostonians from every corner of the city as a legend, visionary, mentor and dedicated family man at a funeral service in the South End Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds of mourners gathered at Union United Methodist Church where many donned King's signature bow tie and each pew was adorned with a rainbow, representing King's Rainbow Coalition, which he pioneered with great success by bringing diverse Boston residents together with common issues across the lines of race and class. One of King's most notable quotes was repeated by many with laughter and tears throughout the course of the service; ""Love is the question and the answer.""King, who died at age 94 two weeks ago, was one of 11 children and had six children of his own with his wife, Joyce.King's son, Michael, said, ""We shared our father with the city and everything like that, and so I just hope that going forward we can still build on that aspect of family."" Michael King said the outpouring of community support since his father's death has been inspriring and overwhelming. ""I'm still riding that wave.""""I thought Grandpa was the coolest,"" said King's granddaughter, Xaivier Ringer. Through tears, she said King woke her up early in the morning to play tennis, taught her compassion for her community, and invited her to Saturday breakfast with her grandmother every single week.""Grandpa, you were a consistent, steady center of my childhood that guides me even now as a woman,"" Ringer said.Fighting for affordable housing, working as a teacher and social worker and hitting the streets of Boston as he campaigned for mayor and state representative helped King make a broad impact and pave the way for future politicans.Mayor Michelle Wu, speaking at the funeral alongside Gov. Maura Healey and U.S. Rep Ayanna Pressley, said, ""We know that we would not be here without Mel King.""She said King built the city up and knit its people together. ""Mel's flame burns with the radius and warm that finds itself in every corner of our city.""Healey described King as rooted in service, driven by love and leading with love. ""The work of Mel King reverberates throughout this city and well beyond the borders of Massachusetts, and so will his legacy.""King was a ""bottomless well of love and justice,"" according to Pressley. She noted that every word King said mattered and was carefully chosen. ""His memory will forever nourish the earth we tread, his words will guide us on our path to justice. And today he wears an eternal crown befitting the king he was. Rest in power.""Many other Massachusetts politicans were in attendance, including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins and several Boston City Councilors.The funeral was filled with music from local artists and students who sang King's songs and recited his poetry. One student, Clinton Osula, said King was a role model for the community. ""Mel believed in me and kids like me when the world didn't. ... Mel I can't thank you enough for all you have done.""State Rep. Byron Rushing delivered King's eulogy, sharing details about his life and advocacy in the city of Boston. ""We need to understand that Mel was not ahead of his time. Mel was right on time,"" Rushing said. Government leadership, he said, was behind the time and never caught up to King.The community will gather for brunch in King's honor at Florian Hall on Sunday. King is survived by his wife, six children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",Local,"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 18:17:01 EST",c84f671711490204e9bab1a5b3b30459
234,A roadblock to life-saving addiction treatment is gone. Now what?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/06/a-roadblock-to-life-saving-addiction-treatment-is-gone-now-what,"For two decades — as opioid overdose deaths rose steadily — the federal government limited access to buprenorphine, a medication that addiction experts consider the gold-standard for treating patients with an opioid use disorder. Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.","For two decades — as opioid overdose deaths rose steadily — the federal government limited access to buprenorphine, a medication that addiction experts consider the gold-standard for treating patients with an opioid use disorder. Study after study shows it helps people continue addiction treatment while reducing the risk of overdose, and death.Clinicians who wanted to prescribe the medicine had to complete an 8-hour training. They could only treat a limited number of patients and had to keep special records. They were given a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number starting with X, a designation that many doctors say made them a target for drug enforcement audits.""Just the process associated with taking care of our patients with a substance use disorder made us feel like, 'boy, this is dangerous stuff,'"" says Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, who chairs the American Medical Association's task force on substance use disorder.""The science doesn't support that but the rigamarole suggested that.""That rigamarole is mostly gone. Congress eliminated what became known as the ""X-waiver"" in legislation President Biden signed late last year. Now begins what some addiction experts are calling a truth serum moment.Was the X-waiver and the burdens that came with it the real reason only about 7% of clinicians in the U.S. were cleared to prescribe buprenorphine? Or was it an excuse that masked hesitation about treating addiction, if not outright disdain for these patients?There's great optimism among some leaders that getting rid of the X-waiver will expand access to buprenorphine and reduce overdoses. One study from 2021 shows taking buprenorphine reduces the risk by 50%. The medication is an opioid that produces much weaker effects than heroin or fentanyl and reduces cravings for those deadlier drugs.The nation's drug czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, says getting rid of the X-waiver will ultimately prevent millions of deaths.""The impact of this will be felt for years to come,"" Gupta says. ""It is a true historic change that, frankly, I could only dream of being possible.""Gupta and others envision obstetricians prescribing buprenorphine to their pregnant patients, infectious disease doctors adding it to their medical tool box, and lots more patients starting buprenorphine when they come to emergency rooms, primary care clinics and rehabilitation facilities.We are ""transforming the way we think to make every moment an opportunity to start this treatment and save someone's life,"" says Dr. Sarah Wakeman, the medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston.Wakeman says clinicians who she's been reaching out to for the past decade are finally willing to consider treating patients with buprenorphine. Still, she knows stigma and discrimination could undermine efforts to help those who aren't being served. In 2021, a national survey showed just 22% of people with an opioid use disorder received buprenorphine or methadone, which is another form of medication-assisted treatment.The truth serum experimentThe truth serum experiment – what will test whether clinicians will now step up prescribing – is underway in hospitals and clinics across the country as patients struggling with addiction queue up for treatment.One woman named Kim, 65, is among them.Kim's recent visit to the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center in southern Massachusetts began in an exam room with Jamie Simmons, a registered nurse who runs the center's addiction treatment program but doesn't have prescribing powers. NPR agreed to use only Kim's first name to limit discrimination linked to her drug use.Kim tells Simmons that buprenorphine has helped her stay off heroin and avoid an overdose for nearly 20 years. Kim takes a brand of the medication called Suboxone, which comes in the form of thin film-like strips she dissolves under her tongue.""It's the best thing they could have ever come out with,"" Kim says, ""I don't think I ever even had a desire to use heroin since I've been taking them.""Buprenorphine can produce mild euphoria and slow breathing but there's a ceiling on the effects. Patients like Kim may develop a tolerance and not experience any effects.""I don't get high on Suboxones,"" Kim says, ""they just keep me normal.""Still many clinicians have been hesitant to use buprenorphine – known as a partial opioid agonist – to treat an addiction to more deadly forms of the drug.Kim's primary care doctor at the health center never applied for an X-waiver. So for years Kim has bounced from one treatment program to another, seeking a prescription. When there were lapses in her access to buprenorphine, the cravings returned – an especially scary prospect now that the powerful opioid fentanyl has replaced heroin on the streets of Massachusetts, where Kim lives.""I've seen so many people fall out [overdose] in the last month,"" says Kim, her eyes wide, ""that stuff is so strong that within a couple minutes, boom.""Because fentanyl can kill so quickly, the benefits of taking buprenorphine and other medications to treat an opioid use disorder have increased as deaths linked to even stronger types of fentanyl rise. Buprenorphine is present in a small percentage of overdose deaths nationwide, 2.6% – virtually always with a mix of other drugs, often benzodiazepines. Fentanyl is in 94% of overdose deaths in Massachusetts.""Bottom line is, fentanyl kills people, buprenorphine doesn't,"" Simmons says.That reality adds urgency to Kim's health center visit because Kim took her last Suboxone before arriving. Her latest prescription has run out. Cravings for heroin could resume tomorrow if she doesn't get more Suboxone. Simmons confirms the dose and tells Kim that her primary care doctor may be willing to renew the prescription now that the X-waiver is not required. But Dr. Than Win has some concerns after reviewing Kim's most recent urine test.It showed traces of cocaine, fentanyl, marijuana and Xanax, and Win says she's worried about how the street drugs might interact with buprenorphine.""I don't want my patients to die from an overdose,"" Win says. ""But I'm not comfortable with the fentanyl and a lot of narcotics in the system.""Kim is adamant that she's not intentionally ingesting fentanyl. It might have been in the cocaine she says her roommate shares occasionally. Kim says she takes the Xanax to sleep. Her drug use presents complications that many primary care doctors don't have experience managing. Some clinicians are apprehensive about using an opioid to treat an addiction to opioids, despite compelling evidence that it saves patients' lives.Win is worried about writing her first prescription for Suboxone. But she agrees to help Kim stay on the medication.""I wanted to start with someone a little bit easier,"" Win says. ""It's hard for me, that's the reality and truth.""About half of the providers at the health center had an X-waiver when it was still required. Simmons says some of the resistance to having the waiver was rooted in stigma or misunderstanding about addiction. She urges doctors to treat addiction as they would any other disease.""You wouldn't not treat a diabetic, you wouldn't not treat a patient who is hypertensive,"" Simmons says. ""People can't control that they formed an addiction to an opiate, alcohol or a benzo.""Searching for solutions to soften stigmaAlthough the restrictions on buprenorphine prescribing are no longer in place, Dr. Mukkamala says the perception created by the X-waiver lingers.""That legacy of elevating this to a level of scrutiny and caution, that needs to be sort of walked back,"" says Mukkamala with the AMA. ""That's going to come from education.""Mukkamala sees promise in the next generation of doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants coming out of schools that have added addiction training. The AMA and the American Society of Addiction Medicine have online resources for clinicians who want to learn on their own.Some of these resources may help fulfill a new training requirement for clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine and other controlled narcotics. It will take effect in June. The DEA has not issued details about that training.But training alone may not shift behavior: take the experience of Rhode Island.The number of doctors approved to prescribe buprenorphine jumped more than 200% from 2016 to 2022 after the state said physician training should include an X-waiver. Still, having the option to prescribe buprenorphine ""didn't open the floodgates"" for patients in need of treatment, says Dr. Jody Rich, an addiction specialist who teaches at Brown University. The number of patients taking buprenorphine in Rhode Island increased – from 2016 to 2022 when the number of qualified prescribers jumped – but at a much slower rate .""It all comes back to stigma,"" Rich says.He says longstanding resistance among some providers to treating addiction is shifting as younger people enter medicine. But the opioid crisis can't wait for a generational change, he says. To expand buprenorphine access now, Rich's research shows states could use pharmacists, partnered with doctors, to help manage the care of more patients with an opioid use disorder.Wakeman, at Mass General Brigham, says it might be time to hold clinicians who don't provide addiction care accountable through quality measures tied to payments.""We're expected to care for patients with diabetes or to care for patients with heart attack in a certain way and the same should be true for patients with an opioid use disorder,"" says Wakeman.One quality measure could be to track how often prescribers start and continue buprenorphine treatment. Wakeman says it would also help if insurers reimbursed clinics for the cost of staff who aren't traditional clinicians but are critical in addiction care, like recovery coaches and case managers.Will ending the X-waiver close racial gaps?Wakeman and others are paying especially close attention to whether eliminating the X-waiver helps narrow racial gaps in buprenorphine treatment.The medication is much more commonly prescribed to white patients with private insurance or who can pay cash. But there are also stark differences by race at some health centers where most patients are on Medicaid and would seem to have equal access to this addiction treatment.At the New Bedford health center, Black patients represent 15% of all patients but only 6% of those taking buprenorphine. For Hispanics that comparison is 30% to 23%. Most of the health center patients prescribed buprenorphine are white, 61%, while they are just 36% of patients overall.Dr. Helena Hansen, who co-authored a book on race in the opioid epidemic, says access to buprenorphine doesn't guarantee that patients will benefit from it.""People are not able to stay on a life-saving medication unless the immense instability in housing, employment, social supports — the very fabric of their communities — is addressed,"" says Hansen. ""That's where we fall incredibly short in the United States.""Hansen says expanding access to buprenorphine has helped reduce overdose deaths dramatically among all drug users in France, including those who are low-income and immigrants. There, patients with an opioid use disorder are seen in their communities and offered a wide range of social services.""Removing the X-waiver,"" says Hansen, ""is not in itself going to revolutionize the opioid overdose crisis in our country. We would need to do much more.""This story is from of NPR's partnership with WBUR and KHN. KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

3359,Laws banning 'critical race theory' in schools will persist. One of its originators says it's time to address the deeper issue.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/31/laws-banning-critical-race-theory-in-schools-will-persist-one-of-its-originators-says-its-time-to-address-the-deeper-issue,"Kimberlé Crenshaw says laws passed now will still stand in a century, and it's long past time to protect the teaching of Black history.","As part of a recently passed African American history standards initiative, Florida public schools will now teach students that some Black people benefitted from slavery because it taught them useful skills. It’s not the only one of its kind. “That was shocking to people because they understood that that was minimizing what enslavement was all about. But the whole point ... of anti-wokeness is to fundamentally change the story of the continuing relevance of enslavement and segregation,” Kimberlé Crenshaw said on Boston Public Radio Monday. Crenshaw, the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, says that many members of the public see the topline problems of censorship, but they don’t see how deep the problems go. Recognizing the intersectionality of the issues of race, gender and ideology, she says, is key to addressing the ongoing attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion — and Black history, in particular — in education. It’s an issue she also sees in colleges, such as the recent affirmative action ruling from the Supreme Court that dictated universities can no longer use race-conscious admissions. So far this year, 40 bills have been introduced across the country restricting colleges from having offices and staff devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion. Of those, seven have become law in North Dakota, Tenneesse, Florida and Texas. As more bills aimed at restricting diversity efforts in schools and the teaching of Black American history are proposed in statehouses across the nation, Crenshaw says these measures' effects will last far longer than the politcians who introduced them. ""It chills teachers not to teach this material. That is still going to be on the books. That will last long after we don't even remember who [Gov. Ron] DeSantis was. That's what we have to wake up to,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's not just about 2024, it's really about the rest of this century."" Crenshaw created the concept of intersectionality and is one of the scholars behind critical race theory. Critical race theory is, in part, an academic framework to look at institutional racial bias rather than individual actors. In many corners, critical race theory — often shortened as CRT — has become an imprecise catchall for ideas or parts of American history that some would rather not see taught in schools. But the exact definition doesn't matter, according to Crenshaw. She said that right-wing outrage over CRT is less about the specific material being taught and more about the loss of identity among white individuals. ""Most of those people who are upset, going to a school board meeting, saying 'I don't want CRT in schools' — they couldn't define that. Racial justice, diversity, they couldn't define it. But they don't have to. All they need to do is be wound up with the message that: this is something that's taking something away from you,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's getting people upset about what they feel they're personally losing. And it's not necessarily material, it could be psychological. It is: 'We [white people] are no longer the center of American story, we have to share it with other people — and we have to share it with other stories.'"" In Feburary, after backlash from conservatives, the College Board expunged the topics of intersectionality, critical race theory, the queer experience and more from its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies. The move was highly criticized by civil rights advocates, including Crenshaw, and the College Board later walked it back in April.""We need to not racially appease. We need to realize that there's a long connection between racism and fascism and anti-Blackness — we're seeing it play out now,"" Crenshaw said. She says that putting up resistance to restrictions on Black education is vital. ""We need to recognize that when we see the likes of DeSantis, and others, coming after modest changes in the story that we tell about ourselves, that is calling us to defend the full narrative of the U.S. They're coming after those of us who value a multiracial democracy, so we need to show up as well,"" she said. Crenshaw will be participating in a panel Tuesday in Boston during the annual NAACP convention.",Local,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 19:34:43 EST",3bf29ccb3b9b2a8bd41c48def5c26121
1490,'Gimme a break!' Biden blasts insurance hassles for mental health treatment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/26/gimme-a-break-biden-blasts-insurance-hassles-for-mental-health-treatment,"If you break your arm, you go to the doctor, your insurance (usually) pays. Why is it so much harder to get health insurance to pick up the tab if you have a mental health breakdown?","If you break your arm, you go to the doctor, your insurance (usually) pays. Why is it so much harder to get health insurance to pick up the tab if you have a mental health breakdown?That's the question President Joe Biden asked yesterday, as he touted new rules he says will get insurance to pay for mental health care more often. The regulations are part of a proposed rule that would strengthen existing policies already on the books and close loopholes that have left patients with too few options for mental health care covered by insurance.Biden specifically criticized the reauthorization process — where insurers make patients jump bureaucratic hurdles to get their care paid for. ""You get referrals to see mental health specialists,"" Biden said at a White House press conference Tuesday, ""but when you make the appointment, they say, 'I can't see you until your doctor submits the paperwork and gets special permission from the insurance company.' Gimme a break."" A landmark law in 2008 called the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act tried to fix the parity issues, but insurers found loopholes and ways to avoid paying for care. For example, it might appear as though an insurer has a good list network of mental health professionals. But in fact many of those therapists and doctors won't take new patients, or are no longer practicing, or are too far away. Or sometimes insurers would require paperwork to authorize treatment — repeatedly — in order to keep getting treatment. Some families NPR interviewed said the reauthorization could be almost daily.Serious mental illness is often a life or death situation, but if insurance doesn't cover care, it's a huge out-of-pocket cost. Paying directly, without insurance, for something like inpatient substance abuse treatment can easily cost $100,000 — or more. So even families with resources often end up tapping every source of cash and credit they can. A Michigan family NPR spoke to last year did just that, mortgaging their house and racking up a bill over $250,000 to care for her son who was suicidal. (NPR agreed not to use the family's last name because it would identify a minor with mental illness.) ""All of our savings are gone. How are we going to send our kids to school? How are we going to, like what are we going to do, how are we going to recover from this? I don't know,"" said mom, Rachel. ""Those thoughts in your mind — there's no space for that when you are just trying to keep your child alive."" Out of desperation, some families impoverish themselves to qualify for public insurance like Medicaid. Some forego care and let conditions worsen into a bigger crisis, or end up in the ER. Here are the three policy changes in Biden's proposed rule:Accountability with data. The White House is trying to address the fact there's not a lot of good data — or even clear definitions — to track how patients are affected by insurers' policies. So it hasn't been possible to hold insurers accountable. Under the new rule, the government will be requiring insurers to report on the outcomes of their coverage, showing that the offer patients eqaul access to medical and mental health care.Attention to payments and policies. The rule says insurers can't use techniques like prior authorization and narrow networks of few therapists to deny care. It also says insurers have to use similar ways of setting out-of-network payment rates for mental health care as for medical care. Expand coverage by closing a loophole. The original mental health parity law said health plans offered by state and local governments didn't have to comply. Updates to the law changed that and this proposed rule implements the change. It means about 200 health plans serving 90,000 people will get the coverage.The health insurance industry says it agrees with the administration's goals of achieving parity of coverage between mental and physical care, but says the problem is there are not enough physicians and therapists to go around. ""Access to mental health has been, and continues to be, challenging primarily because of a shortage and lack of clinicians,"" Kristine Grow, a spokesperson for America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.

So far in March, two skiers have died after accidents at Wachusett Mountain in Massachusetts and Pats Peak in New Hampshire, which included a 15-year-old boy. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to discuss the legal liability involved when people get injured on the slopes. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, we know you love to ski. We also know there are dangers associated with skiing. There are also lots of legal issues, another one of your passions. When it comes to accidents on the slopes, to what extent might an injured skier, or a skier's family, be able to sue a resort and receive monetary compensation after an accident or something like it happens? Daniel Medwed: So it varies considerably from state to state. The law in Massachusetts is different from New Hampshire, which differs from that of Vermont. But the gist is basically the same. It's extremely difficult to sue a ski resort for your injuries. And here's why: the first barrier is basically contractual. When you buy that lift pass, that ski ticket, you essentially waive either implicitly or explicitly, your right to sue the mountain for certain risks inherent in the dangerous activity of downhill skiing. The second barrier is often baked into the law. It's part of our statutory framework. So, for instance, Massachusetts specifies in law what the duties of skiers are. This is actually part of our code. So, for instance, a skier shall maintain control of speed and course at all times, and a skier shall be presumed to know the range of their own ability on the slopes. So if you're going too fast, if you're out of control, if you're on that triple diamond black slope when you're really an intermediate skier, then you might be waiving any potential recourse for injuries against the mountain. Paris Alston: Daniel, I wonder if there are any ways to overcome these obstacles. Because it can be tricky, right? In the case of a skier at Wachusett Mountain, he hit a tree. And in the one of the 15-year-old boy at Pats Peak, he hit a bump on a trail that he had gone down a few times before previously. So what if the resort is maybe doing a bad job of maintaining the trails, or there's something else that's playing a role in creating a hazardous condition for the skier? Could you file a lawsuit in those situations? Medwed: Well, it really depends. I mean, these barriers are not insurmountable. It's not as if we give these ski mountains a complete free pass when it comes to liability. So there's a law in Massachusetts that's parallel to the duties of skiers, which imposes duties on ski resorts. Ski resorts have to conspicuously indicate the presence of snowmaking machines and other equipment to avert a potential crash. And also: they have to put flashing or rotating lights on emergency or maintenance vehicles. And I think a failure of the ski resort to comply, to breach that duty, could give rise to a personal injury action. But if that's the case, Paris and Jeremy, I think skiers really have to be mindful of another potential booby trap, which are there are often very strict statutes of limitations for skiers to bring an action against a ski resort. So in Massachusetts, you have to alert the mountain within 90 days, in writing by registered mail, about the accident and provide details about the accident or else you might waive your claim. And even then, you have to file your lawsuit within one year of the accident. Siegel: Everything you've said over the past couple of minutes makes it sound like the law is essentially stacked in favor of resorts. Medwed: Yeah, I think that's right. So on the one hand, I suppose the rationale here is that if there were not barriers on the liability for ski resorts, it would be too cost-prohibitive to ever operate a ski slope. The cost of insurance alone would be astronomical. And the only way you could make a go of it would be by passing the cost on to the consumer in the form of even higher lift tickets. We know how expensive they already are. On the other hand, I think it's a really fair question, and Jeremy, you allude to this, about whether the balance right now is tilted too far in favor of ski resorts. Alston: So, Daniel, you just mentioned the challenges with filing lawsuits against ski resorts, but a lot of accidents are a result of collisions with other skiers, right? I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow has been on the stand in Utah this week talking about this exact thing. Sometimes it's due to careless behavior by other skiers. Are there any restrictions on suing your fellow skiers for causing injuries to you? Medwed: Well, those actions are typically governed by general tort law or personal injury principles. So if another skier is negligent, maybe he or she has breached those duties of the skier that I mentioned, then perhaps that could give a basis for the injured party to file a tort action, a civil liability action, against that individual. So, for example, a bedrock principle of skiing, which is sometimes included in the law explicitly, is that a skier up the hill has an obligation to avoid a collision with a skier down the hill. It's a little bit like rear ending while driving, right? The person higher up bears the responsibility. And so if that skier does get into a collision with someone downhill, then conceivably that could give the basis for a private personal injury action. Siegel: But I guess that's sort of dependent on one skier actually stopping after the accident. Like I'm thinking of hit and runs in cars. Sometimes there's a collision and then the uphill skier might just keep going. Are there any consequences for leaving the scene of a skiing accident? Medwed: And regrettably, that happens all the time. And there are some consequences. So Massachusetts has a law on the books which says that you can get fined not less than $100 — It's not a huge fine but you can get fined — if you knowingly have an accident on a ski slope and then you depart without providing your personal identification or clearly identifying yourself to the person you've injured. Now, of course, that's dependent on someone actually catching you as you go down the mountain, some good Samaritan further down the slope. But there is a law on the books, at least in Massachusetts, to govern that. Alston: So it sounds like that's mostly civil liability or personal injury actions. But say a good Samaritan does catch you. Could you ever be found guilty of a crime for injuring someone on a ski slope? Medwed: There are cases out there, and they're relatively rare, of criminal actions that derive from accidents on ski slopes. There's a relatively famous case from Vail Resort in Colorado from about 25 years ago where a kid had had a little bit too much to drink, was hurtling down a mountain going on moguls. It was a bumpy slope. He had his arms out. He was sitting back on his skis to maximize his speed. And unfortunately, he got some air and hit somebody in the head with the tip of his ski. And the blunt force trauma caused a death. And ultimately, the Colorado Supreme Court said it was appropriate to charge him, to have the jury consider whether that was reckless manslaughter. Did he consciously disregard the substantial risk of death when he engaged in that type of reckless behavior? So it happens. It's relatively rare, but there are criminal actions that derive from ski accidents occasionally.",Local,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:32:09 EST",ac774972f3c4092b4a88f7cfdcbd93cc

5101,Deep cuts to Brockton schools budget spark layoffs of at least 130 positions,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/06/13/deep-cuts-to-brockton-schools-budget-spark-layoffs-of-at-least-130-positions,District officials blamed student enrollment declines for the $18 million budget deficit.,"Brockton Public Schools officials said they will lay off at least 130 teacher and staff positions, or nearly 10% of its educators, as a result of sweeping budget cuts. District officials blamed student enrollment declines for the $18 million budget deficit that prompted the layoffs. The state funds districts on a per pupil basis, and since 2020, Brockton has lost more than 1,300 students, creating a significant shortfall. Many students left school during the pandemic to take jobs that would help support their families, or to attend private or charter schools.Parent Maggie Pinney, whose daughter will enter her final year of high school in the fall, said she's so frustrated, she's considering changing districts.“Is my [rising] senior going to be able to actually learn?” Pinney asked. “She already had challenges prior to the pandemic that were further exacerbated after the pandemic. We're still trying to seek some resolution for her.”Brockton Public Schools spokesperson Jessica Silva-Hodges said the district has exhausted all of its other options for shrinking its budget. She said the district is rolling out a five-year improvement plan, and that Brockton city officials are trying to expand the city's tax base by attracting new business — but those efforts have not come in time to alter the school district's stark funding outlook for next year.“We really needed to make a change, unfortunately, to realign staffing with the existing enrollment,” Silva-Hodges said. The district did not specify how many cuts are to teachers, teachers' aides and other staff positions. Silva-Hodges said the layoffs were made equitably and that there will be no outsized impact on any particular school or program.“We had been very careful in making decisions to ensure that students won't have any loss of programming or extra extracurricular activities,” she said. “That's something that's been a big priority.”Among the big changes for the district, Brockton Superintendent Mike Thomas will also assume the role of interim principal at Brockton High School starting this fall in addition to his duties leading the district. Thomas will steer programming shifts at the high school, but he will not receive extra pay, according to the Brockton Enterprise.""[Thomas] felt that if he's going to be making significant enough changes at the high school, then he needs to be the one leading that work and do a hands-on day to day effort to realign the programs at the high school,"" Silva-Hodges said. More than 200 school staff and administrators have signed a petition urging Brockton City Council to fund the district’s missing $18 million. In a statement to GBH, the Brockton Education Assocation, the union representing teachers, and the Independent Brockton Administrative Assistants and Technical Employee Association and the Brockton Education Support Professionals Association, two unions representing school staff, balked at the cuts, saying they would not solve the district's problems and that the city needs to prioritize the needs of its young people.“We recognize that student enrollment in BPS has declined, however we also recognize that these cuts will gravely impact the students we continue to serve each day,” the unions said in a joint statement. They said more than 80% of Brockton’s student population is designated as having special needs and almost 80% of the district's students are economically disadvantaged. Those student populations will be most deeply affected by the cuts. Pinney, the concerned parent, said her daughter has special needs and that her biggest concern is that class sizes will grow. “This is a problem,"" she said. ""It's important that these class sizes allow for attention and learning and the least amount of disruption.”",Education,"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:39:18 EST",9bb65c2633da3dae40f491e5792fc896
1264,Let the (informed) Boston 2025 mayoral speculation begin!,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/27/let-the-informed-boston-2025-mayoral-speculation-begin,A strange shindig on the Cape surfaced a conversation that’s been brewing quietly for months.,"This story first ran in GBH News’ politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get our rundown of the Massachusetts’ latest political happenings every Thursday morning straight to your inbox.SeparatorLast week, the Dorchester Reporter’s Gin Dumcius wrote about an enigmatic event at PR honcho George Regan’s home in Mashpee. The shindig was billed in an email as a fundraiser for Boston City Council President Ed Flynn and a birthday celebration for his father, former Boston Mayor and Vatican ambassador Ray Flynn. But it was also described as the rollout of a group called Save Our City, aimed at “sav[ing] … Boston from the negative impacts of the ultra-progressive policies [that] dominate the current City Council and current administration at Boston City Hall.”When Dumcius contacted several elected officials who were slated to attend, including Ed Flynn and his at-large council colleagues Erin Murphy and Michael Flaherty, they said they didn’t know about “Save Our City” and weren’t involved in it. Regan, for his part, blamed his secretary for the email and said no “Save Our City” campaign exists, while also suggesting that he believes the city needs saving. (Boston “is not on the right path,” Regan said.)It was a surreal bit of political slapstick — but it also thrust into the open a conversation about Boston politics that’s been simmering below the surface for months. In 2025, when Mayor Michelle Wu will be up for reelection, will she face a credible challenger? Or will she, instead, coast to a second term with only token opposition, or even no opponent at all? My colleague Peter Kadzis, who’s been watching Boston politics for decades, doesn’t foresee Wu running unopposed, like her mentor Tom Menino did when he sought a second mayoral term back in 1997. But he doesn’t believe she’ll have to break much of a sweat, either. “If seventy years of political history is any guide, I think Michelle Wu can safely expect to be reelected,” Kadzis said. “Whoever challenges her will probably come in somewhere in the thirty-percent vote range” — in other words, about where Tito Jackson landed in his 2017 challenge to Marty Walsh.Kadzis believes Wu has a few advantages working in her favor, above and beyond Boston’s historic aversion to tossing out mayoral incumbents (which last happened in 1949). He sees her picks to lead the Boston Police, Boston Public Schools and Boston Fire Department — Michael Cox, Mary Skipper and Paul Burke — as strong administrators who can tamp down any trouble that might arise in their departments. And he believes the well documented travails of the Boston City Council will bolster Wu’s own standing with the electorate.“For voters citywide, the city council is going to appear … radical or irresponsible,” Kadzis said. “And no matter how progressive Wu is, she’s going to appear to be the more sensible person.” However, one political strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity sees the mayor as more vulnerable.“The number of rooms I've been in where there's grumbling, whether it’s the business community or people connected to Mass. and Cass — there’s a lot of discontent out there, and it’s very likely someone will [run against her],” the strategist said. “The question is: Are you getting a top-tier candidate who can give it a real shot, or a B-level candidate who’s going to get the floor wiped with them?” To be competitive, the strategist added, a challenger would need to have between $1 million and $1.5 million on hand to start their campaign — a high hurdle to clear, given the aforementioned invulnerability of Boston mayoral incumbents. And they'd need to be able to knit together disparate groups of voters, rather than simply catering to one aggrieved segment of the electorate.Who, exactly, might such a candidate be? If they possess the requisite strengths, might their relationship with Wu preclude a challenge? (Before proposing two names, the strategist acknowledged that, in all likelihood, neither would ever run against Wu.) And even if this hypothetical challenger checked the requisite boxes, would their personal ambition be strong enough to pull them into a race they'd be likely to lose? Wu, we should recall, won in a landslide in 2021, beating Annissa Essaibi George 64% to 36%. For now, of course, it’s all speculative — but we’re entering the stretch in which speculation becomes reality. If Wu does get a challenger, they will likely make it official a year to 18 months from now, and will start sending strong signals of their intentions well before then. In other words, it’s OK to stop whispering about the 2025 mayor’s race and start talking about it openly.",Politics,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:26:02 EST",88ca6c022cae604bacb4cce561376731

Not only has the war in Ukraine set off a geopolitical realignment, but it has caused economic hardship far from the epicenter of the fighting.The Feb. 24, 2022, invasion has touched off a refugee crisis, as Ukrainians flee the conflict in their homeland and many Russian men seek to avoid conscription. Meanwhile, it has spurred a process toward expanding NATO, with Finland and Sweden pursuing membership after decades of official neutrality.Ukraine and Russia are key exporters of wheat, barley, corn and cooking oil, particularly to African and Middle Eastern countries. Turkey and the United Nations brokered a deal last summer to allow Ukrainian grain to pass through Black Sea ports, but Russia is reportedly still hindering shipments. Russia is also a major producer of fertilizer and petroleum. Disruptions to the flow of these goods are compounding other supply chain and climate challenges, driving up food and gas prices and causing shortages in places such as Chad, Tunisia and Sri Lanka.More than 8 million refugees have fled Ukraine in what the World Health Organization describes as ""the largest movement of people in the European Region since the Second World War."" Many have been involuntarily relocated by Russia. Others have put a strain on resources, as well as schools and hospitals, in Poland and Germany.A 21st century war in Europe — led by a nuclear power — is pushing the world toward realignment. It has rattled NATO, the European Union and the U.N., forcing countries to take sides in ways that have led to escalating tensions and diplomatic shifts. For example, Turkey, despite being a NATO member, has increased trade with Russia since the start of the war and has thrown up objections to allowing Sweden and Finland into the alliance.Russia is one of the world's largest producers of oil and fuel. European countries have banned the Russian oil, gas and diesel they relied on, which initially caused a steep spike in prices. However, moves by European nations to lock in alternative sources, along with conservation efforts and a mild winter, have largely alleviated those price hikes. Now prices have returned to pre-invasion levels.Russia has more nuclear weapons than any other country. Its attack on Ukraine has notably reenergized NATO, with the U.S. and other member states funneling tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment into Ukraine. Early weapons deliveries included anti-tank rockets such as the U.S.-made Javelin. In the latest moves, the U.S., Germany and Britain have promised to provide state-of-the-art tanks.NPR's Will Chase, Alex Leff, Pam Webster, Desiree Hicks and Nishant Dahiya contributed to this report.

1562,GBH's Phillip Martin remembering Mel King: 'He's leaving a lot behind. But he's also pushing a lot of things forward.',https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/29/gbhs-phillip-martin-remembering-mel-king-hes-leaving-a-lot-behind-but-hes-also-pushing-a-lot-of-things-forward,"""He represents the city's current multiracial political hierarchy, as opposed to what we've seen in the past.""","The city of Boston is grieving the loss of Melvin Herbert King, who died yesterday at the age of 94. Mel King was a nationally known civil rights icon, lawmaker and the first Black mayoral candidate to advance to a general election in Boston. King is being remembered now for his work as a longtime community organizer and his lasting effect on the city and state politics by the many who knew him, including GBH News’ senior investigative reporter Phillip Martin, who joined GBH’s Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to share his memories. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: This is a really huge, devastating loss of someone who lived a remarkable life. Phillip, tell us what Mel King represented in the context of Boston history. Phillip Martin: Well, I think everything. I mean, he defined it over a lifetime. I mean, 94 years: activist, community organizer, change-maker. When a lot of people think about Boston, they think about two things, historically speaking. They think about the city that's defined by its revolutionary provenance, you know, the 18th century. And they also think about it as a city defined by the busing of the 1970s. But King sort of represented this arc of 20th- and 21st-century history — its racial and class intolerance for sure, but also the fight against racism. He represents the city's current multiracial political hierarchy, as opposed to what we've seen in the past. Jeremy Siegel: You used that phrase “the arc of history,” referencing what King represented as a community activist and as a lawmaker. Tell us a little bit more about the transformation that he was part of in the city of Boston. Martin: Absolutely. People drive every day down Dartmouth Street and they see these apartments called the Tent City Apartments. And I'm not sure how many people think about how that got there, because you're looking at an apartment complex that's a mixed-income housing complex in the heart of Boston, Copley Square, where you actually have low-income people living there. This was the result of a protest that began in the late ’60s against the Boston Redevelopment Authority, led by Mel King. The intention of the city, the BRA at the time — the Boston Redevelopment Authority — was to build this garage. And King led this protest culminating in this dedicated, quality living community, eponymously called Tent City Apartments. That was Mel King! Alston: That was one of the first things I learned when I was learning about Mel King upon moving here.Martin: That's right. This originated from this popular protest against gentrification. You have to think about Mel King, in answer to your question, his 10 years as a state representative elected in 1973, in the midst of extraordinary racial turmoil. And we also have to think about Mel King — at that time, you had this deep reactionary political leadership in the '70s, represented by people like Louise Day Hicks, a city councilor and former congressperson. And King formed this Rainbow Coalition, a campaign for mayor in 1983 that was sort of an adjacent to what was happening on the national level with Jesse Jackson. And here is an interview with Mel King in 1983. This interview was conducted by reporter Gail Harris, and it's King explaining why he was running for mayor. And this explains it all.[Previously recorded] Mel King: I can remember a time when I went to do an errand and came back with a man following. And it was cold. And he came to the door and I ran in and my father saw him. And the man said that he was hungry and cold, came in and was fed, warmed and given some food on his way. And I'll never forget that. My father said, “No matter what you have, a little, you always have enough to share.” It's kind of stuck with me all of my life. [Recording ends]Martin: So you have this powerful, very tall, soft-spoken man who was just absolutely compassionate. And as another example, final example of this: When I was working with Oxfam America, and at this time it was located in the Bay Village, Mel King worked with us on outreach programs, not just to the city, but to Haiti, Nicaragua and Southern Africa in the 1980s. Alston: So many milestones throughout his life there, Phillip. And, you know, another thing that I would hear about Mel King was was how much community organizing was part of just who he was as a person, his everyday life. He was in the streets during protests. He was in the State House legislating, but he was also welcoming people into his own house to organize and to talk about the issues of the day. So tell us a little bit about those famous Sunday brunches he would have in the South End. Martin: Oh, yeah. Besides the good food, I think everyone listening who's been to Mel King's house knows exactly what I'm talking about. You had food, you had laughs, but you also had serious discussion. People would strategize about, for example, in the '80s, about Boston's anti-apartheid movement to improve the position of Black and brown workers in the city. He would have people at the house from from organizations like the Chinese Progressive Association. He also represented the community at MIT. He ran this Community Fellows program. He was this true coalition builder, coalitions that stretched across racial lines. Many activists can say they are the children, if you will, of Mel King. As I said, he was close to Jesse Jackson, whose own Rainbow Coalition actually echoed Mel King's on a national level in terms of successful coalition-building. That's what I can say about him. Siegel: And real quickly, before we let you go, Phillip, what legacy does Mel King leave behind? Martin: In many ways, he's leaving a lot behind. But he's also pushing a lot of things forward, even his 1983 book. It has been basically re-formed to reflect the times. And that was at the insistence of young activists in this area. He also left behind these legacy at the at the South End Settlements — the South End Technology Center, for example, which he started in 1997. But most importantly, his six children and his wife, Joyce, are a beautiful family. They welcomed you into their home. And we will miss you, Mel King.",Local,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:35:11 EST",3547f23273aaa28d8dee7a764acb7b8b

Ed Markey said at an event announcing the grades along the Charles River in Cambridge. ""But this report card says we still have a long way to go, especially since we're being challenged by climate change.""The report card says extreme weather fluctuations linked to climate change have been impacting water quality in the watersheds. In 2021, record precipitation caused over 126 million gallons of sewage and storm water to be discharged into the Charles River. The following year, a severe drought caused the Charles to nearly run dry in places.Emily Norton, executive director of the Charles River Watershed Association, said urban areas along the river's path have worse water quality because they have more polluted stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows. She said the river is in better shape than it was in the mid-1990s — when the EPA launched the ""Clean Charles Initiative"" and former Gov. Bill Weld famously jumped into the dirty water — but progress has stalled in recent years.""People keep asking us: 'If Paris can make the Seine swimmable for the summer 2024 Olympics, why can't we swim in the Charles?' And frankly, it's a good question. The Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, called for fishable, swimmable rivers by 1983,"" Norton said.The report generally gives good grades for water quality in the Mystic River, but several tributaries rated poorly as a result of sewage contamination. Mill Creek flunked, and Alewife Brook and the Malden River got a grade of D.Markey noted that as a child, he was told by his mother not swim in the Malden River, because it wasn't clean enough. The new report gave that river a D grade.""So not enough has changed for those kids in Malden since the days when I was growing up there,"" Markey said. ""And that's why I urge all of our partners here to continue working together to secure healthy and safe watersheds for everyone."" ""We should all be leaning in for the next 20 years of work,"" said Mystic River Watershed Association Executive Director Patrick Herron. ""It's going to require a tremendous investment, a billion dollars of investment to actually have a clean waterway that we can all swim in and boat in."" The lakes and ponds of the Neponset River watershed also rank well for water quality. But, like the Mystic River watershed, the effects of both drought and increased precipitation have had a negative impact on smaller tributaries.""One of the things that is really clear from this year's data is the imprint of climate change on the results we're seeing,"" said Neponset River Watershed Association Executive Director Ian Cooke. ""This year we looked at three years' worth of data to compose the grades. One of those was a severe drought year. Two of them were very wet years."" Those intense downpours, Cooke said, have shifted what pollutants are harming our waterways.""Many of our lakes now are much more governed by fertilizer pollution and algae blooms in terms of their usability than they are the traditional bacteria indicator that we usually look at,"" he said. ""So definitely we need to do what we can to try to bend the curve on the future of climate change.""The water quality assessments are based on samples collected by hundreds of volunteers for the three watershed associations. Those samples are analyzed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which reports the results to the EPA.",Local,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:01:02 EST",8eb4e07361e517503d2311e99b95bd2d

Despite being charged with orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history and facing the prospect of spending his life in prison, he has been tweeting and giving interviews with media — all in an attempt to defend himself in the court of public opinion.It's an unusual strategy for a high-profile criminal defendant who oversaw a company that lost billions of dollars of customer money. And it has left lawyers not involved in the case aghast, since each quotation and tweet from Bankman-Fried is effectively a gift to prosecutors, who can use that material to build their case against him.""I think every white-collar lawyer you could ask would say, 'Shut up: Keep your mouth shut, and let us do the talking,'"" says Rebecca Mermelstein, a partner at the law firm O'Melveny.Through a spokesman, Bankman-Fried declined NPR's request for an interview. Bankman-Fried in trouble over political donationsThe trail of communication — including eight tweets, a Substack newsletter, and a handful of lengthy interviews with the media — that Bankman-Fried has left behind is already coming back to haunt him.For example, a few weeks before Bankman-Fried was arrested, crypto vlogger Tiffany Fong interviewed him by phone, and the conversation turned to Bankman-Fried's campaign contributions. (He reportedly donated about $40 million during the 2022 midterms.)During that interview, Bankman-Fried admitted to Fong that he had steered money to candidates in a way that is difficult to track.""All my Republican donations were dark,"" he told Fong. ""And the reason was not for regulatory reasons. It's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to a Republican. They're all super liberal, and I didn't want to have that fight. So, I made all the Republican ones dark.""Those comments to Fong proved unwise.Bankman-Fried was later charged with eight criminal counts, including including wire fraud and ""conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions.""Then, on Thursday, when federal prosecutors unveiled four additional criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, they included new details about their widening case against him.In the latest indictment, prosecutors specifically cited the comments from that interview as part of their additional evidence for their charge on ""unlawful political contributions.""That may not be all. Lawyers warn prosecutors could use more of the comments he's made during his trial, which is set to start in October.Curtailing his communicationsIt's not just interviews that have landed Bankman-Fried in trouble. He has also been reaching out to current employees of FTX, and that could lead to more consequences.Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried used an encrypted messaging app on Jan. 15, to contact the general counsel of FTX's U.S. subsidiary.""I would really love to reconnect and see if there's a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,"" they say he wrote. ""I'd love to get on a phone call sometime soon and chat.""After that message came to light, the judge overseeing the trial imposed new restrictions on Bankman-Fried's bail, prohibiting him from sending encrypted messages and others that disappear after they are read, and he restricted Bankman-Fried from contacting current and former employees of FTX. Why lawyers want their defendants to keep quietAlthough Bankman-Fried has not made a public comment since Jan. 19, lawyers who have dealt with prominent white-collar defendants warn that it can be a challenge to keep them quiet for long, especially if they are accustomed to living in the spotlight. That's a potential problem for Bankman-Fried, who hobnobbed with people like former President Clinton and former quarterback Tom Brady at the height of his popularity.Former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade says she's seen defendants struggle with the temptation to talk, especially politicians who have found themselves embroiled in scandal.""'If I could just talk to you long enough, I can explain it all away,'"" she imagines a defendant thinking. ""'And I can tell you that I was doing was perfectly legitimate.'""It's an approach that lawyers see at play in this case.In his public pronouncements, the former CEO of FTX has sought to defend himself by saying he did not intend to spark losses for customers of FTX, and maintaining, above all else, that he's not a bad guy.For example, days before Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked him if he felt it was fair for people to compare him to Bernie Madoff, one of the world's most infamous fraudsters. ""I don't think that's who I am at all,"" Bankman-Fried replied. ""But I understand why they're saying that. People lost money, and people lost a lot of money.""Reminders of the 'Pharma Bro'Bankman-Fried may not believe he is like Madoff, but he reminds lawyers of another young, disgraced CEO who couldn't keep quiet before his trial: ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli.He first sparked controversy after his company bought the rights to a drug used to treat people with compromised immune systems, and then spiked the price dramatically.Shkreli was later charged with securities fraud, and instead of laying low, he courted even more notoriety in the days leading up to his trial. He got into a public feud with the rapper Ghostface Killah and did several broadcast interviews against his lawyer's advice. Then, when his trial got underway, Shkreli wandered into the press room and badmouthed the prosecution to reporters. That led to a court-imposed gag order, and his defense attorney couldn't hide his frustration in a widely seen video of them leaving the courthouse.Little upside to talkingJust like it backfired for Shkreli, public relation experts also see little upside for Bankman-Fried in talking.Fred Garcia, who teaches crisis management at New York University and Columbia University, says he can't understand what Bankman-Fried ""hopes to get out of it.""""Other than simply to call attention to himself for reasons I can't quite fathom,"" Garcia says.And the public image that helped Bankman-Fried gain notoriety as a twenty-something CEO could now work against him. He became widely known for wearing shorts and t-shirts, and famously played a video game during a pitch meeting with a prominent venture capital firm. But Anthony D'Angelo, a professor of public relations at Syracuse University, says that persona is unlikely to play well any longer among FTX customers, now that they fear their fortunes have disappeared.""Unorthodox is okay,"" D'Angelo says. ""Losing $8 billion among people is not, and whatever charm your cargo shorts and frizzy hair may give you an advantage in in other forums, it's not going to help here.""

3133,What to expect today at Trump's arraignment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/04/04/what-to-expect-today-at-trumps-arraignment,Legal analyst Daniel Medwed sheds light on the criminal legal process.,"Former President Donald Trump is expected to surrender to criminal charges this afternoon following last week's indictment. After he goes through the routine steps of felony arrest processing, he will be arraigned in criminal court and most likely released on his own recognizance pending trial. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to walk through what to expect from the process. This transcript has been lightly edited.Jeremy Siegel: This is a huge day. We've been hearing some live reports on the ground in New York from NPR all morning. A former U.S. president will be arrested and arraigned on criminal charges. You used to practice criminal law in New York yourself. So given your knowledge, what can we expect from today? Daniel Medwed: I used to practice. Now, I guess I preach, right? Paris Alston: You've done, and now you teach. Medwed: Exactly. Here's what I envision, I think the day will unfold in this way. So absent some really unforeseen developments, Trump will go through the routine, regular process of the arrest. Maybe he'll get his fingerprints taken, though they might already be on file. He'll definitely get his mug shot taken and then he'll be escorted from the D.A.'s office, which is at 1 Hogan Pl., behind the courthouse, to the main criminal court building at 100 Centre St. They're really close. I think they're like 100 yards apart. And there might even be a back door he can get in. So I don't know how much time he'll be outside before he goes inside 100 Centre St. Now, once he's in 100 Centre St., which is a really decrepit building, he will be arraigned, as you mentioned at the top. And the arraignment is the moment in the criminal process when a defendant is formally notified about the precise charges against them and given an opportunity to enter an initial plea. In this instance, invariably, Trump is going to plead not guilty. Then a judge will decide whether to release him, it's called being released on your own recognizance, or whether he'll be detained on bail pending trial. It's going to be fairly straightforward with a few little twists and turns, some exceptions from the norm. Alston: We are talking about a former president here, Daniel. And so inevitably that comes with a lot of privileges. What are some other things we might see today that would be different from your everyday person facing criminal charges? Medwed: I have a couple of thoughts on that. So first, here's one thing that's quite different: It's not unprecedented to surrender at the D.A.'s office, at the district attorney's office, but it's quite unusual. People typically surrender at the police station. It's also standard practice for a felony arrest for the arrestee to get handcuffed. I suspect they won't handcuff Trump as a matter of deference to his former position. If they do handcuff him, my guess is that they would put his hands in front of his body, which is a courtesy that's often extended to white collar defendants as opposed to people charged with violent crimes. A second difference is that it's pretty obvious the security is going to be bonkers. Usually, state court officers control all the security at 1 Centre St. Here, they're going to be supplemented, of course, by U.S. secret Service agents, probably the NYPD. It'll feel and look like a circus atmosphere. Siegel: You mentioned that at today's arraignment, the judge will decide whether Trump is released on his own recognizance or detained in jail, presumably on bail, until trial. It's hard to imagine a former president being held in jail. But I mean, what do you think is going to happen? Medwed: I'm pretty comfortable in the prediction, as you suggest, Jeremy, that he's going to be released on his own recognizance, in part because New York law makes it very difficult — in fact, seemingly bans — prosecutors from asking for pretrial detention when the only charges against a defendant are of a nonviolent nature. And unless there's a real curveball here and there's something on that indictment that is a violent offense, which seems quite unlikely, I just think it's almost a lock that he's going to be released on his own recognizance and will be at Trump Tower tonight. Alston: So, Daniel, this bring us a little closer to home. So say this was happening here in Massachusetts. How might things be similar or different to what's happening in New York today? Medwed: There are some general overlapping characteristics of our process. But of course, this is Massachusetts. We have a few idiosyncrasies. So first, consider the bail decision-making calculation: In the commonwealth, a judge must formally consider the severity of the charges, the defendant's risk of flight, the defendant's criminal history and the defendant's current work and living situation in deciding whether to release them or hold them on bail. But there's also something else here in Massachusetts, a 2017 SJC case called Brangan v. Commonwealth, which said that judges must explicitly account for a defendant's unique financial situation in calculating bail. In other words, judges in Massachusetts can't set a bail figure that's beyond the financial reach of a particular defendant. It's a really noble and progressive decision that a few other states have, but it's somewhat peculiar to Massachusetts. A second difference here in Massachusetts is that we're one of only a handful of states, I think only seven, that has banned the use of private or commercial bail bonds people. We don't have a private bail bond system here in Massachusetts. The way you post bond is the defendant will post cash or a check or a credit card, or you'll use what's called a personal surety, you'll have a friend or a family member do the same. I like to think of bail as a form of insurance. If you're released on bail and you don't show up at trial, you forfeit your money. If you do show up, you get it back. Siegel: It's interesting hearing about those aspects of the bail system in Massachusetts, especially after hearing about some of it with New York with former President Trump's trial today. You cited some of the factors that are considered in choosing whether to detain someone on bail. Is public safety a factor here in Massachusetts? When can someone be detained without bail, without any chance of being released before trial? Medwed: Well, in Massachusetts the issue of public safety is handled through a separate process. It's called a dangerousness proceeding. And here's how it works: A prosecutor will indicate that she wants to hold the defendant without bail, hold them indefinitely before trial. And the process, on the one hand, has some attributes that favor the defense: It's an open hearing, a public hearing, and the government bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant poses a risk of danger to the community. So it's a pretty high bar. On the other hand, the prosecution isn't required to put on live witnesses at that hearing. They can meet the standard simply through hearsay evidence, through police reports that are sent to the judge. So dangerousness hearings are somewhat peculiar to Massachusetts, and it's separate from the bail system.",Politics,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 10:19:57 EST",776858aba0f5cdc3a04fd8f7c4303b87
1821,Elizabeth Warren running for third Senate term,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/27/elizabeth-warren-running-for-third-senate-term,"Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, will run again in 2024.","BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that she will seek a third term in 2024.Warren, a prominent voice for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and a failed 2020 presidential contender, said she's running for reelection to end corruption in Washington, make the economy work for the middle class and protect democracy.""I first ran for Senate because I saw how the system is rigged for the rich and powerful and against everyone else. I won because Massachusetts voters know it, too. And now I'm running for Senate again because there's a lot more we've got to do,"" Warren said in a campaign video released Monday.Warren, 73, had more than $2.3 million in her campaign account at the end of 2022, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Warren first won election to the seat in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected to fill out the term of Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009.With the win, the then-Harvard Law School professor became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.In 2018, Warren won a second term, easily defeating Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, before quickly setting her sights on the presidency.While popular among some Democratic voters for her blunt rhetoric, Warren was unable to break away from the party's pack of contenders and dropped out after failing to win any of the states that voted on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in the Democratic primary in her home state.During the campaign against Brown and again during her bid for the presidency, Warren was dogged by past claims of Native American heritage and her inability to provide documentation of that ancestry.That led then-President Donald Trump to go after her early in the presidential campaign, derisively labeling her ""Pocahontas."" Warren had said she learned of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes from stories told by her parents.After the 2020 loss, Warren continued her focus on the financial sector.Warren recently joined California Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, to push a proposal to repeal a 2018 rollback of certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis a decade earlier.The bill, part of discussions in Congress following the recent abrupt failure of two banks, is unlikely to advance.In her campaign video, Warren ticked off a series of priorities from passing a wealth tax and putting stricter rules on banks to making child care more affordable, protecting coastal communities and building what she called ""a 21st century transportation system across all of Massachusetts.""It's unclear who might challenge Warren for the Senate seat. Many Democrats appeared to be waiting until Warren or fellow Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, also a Democrat, decided not to seek reelection. Markey in 2020 fended off a primary challenge from then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy.The state's Republican Party is trying to rebuild after losing the governor's office last year when Republican Gov. Charlie Baker opted not to seek a third term and Democrat Maura Healey handily defeated GOP candidate Geoff Diehl.Warren already has the backing of many high-profile Massachusetts Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Markey.Warren serves on several congressional committees including the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Armed Services.",Politics,"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 07:43:49 EST",590eee051c20b1ab1b243521b8cb3555

Chinese officials have expressed interest in speaking with high-level officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The United States' top diplomat said more talks are expected, but he declined to identify which officials may travel to the country to discuss economic matters in the weeks ahead.""I'll leave that to the near future,"" he said. Blinken said that so far, Beijing has not agreed to resume military-to-military cooperation with the United States, though he said he raised the issue repeatedly during meetings with Chinese officials.""These military-to-military contacts are hugely important if we're going to avoid an unintentional conflict, and that was only reinforced over the last couple of weeks,"" Blinken said. ""We've seen ... incidents on the seas, in the skies that were really dangerous and, in our judgment, unprofessional."" He said the issue remains an ""ongoing priority.""The secretary stressed the importance of cooperatively managing the ""challenge"" of Taiwan, as the two have done ""for nearly five decades,"" especially given Taiwan's important role in global trade. ""If there were to be a crisis over Taiwan, you've got about 50% of the global commercial container traffic that goes through the Taiwan Strait every day. Fifty percent. Half of the world's trade, in effect, goes through there every day,"" Blinken said. ""You've got about 70% of high-end semiconductors that are produced on Taiwan. If either of those things were taken offline as a result of a crisis, it could have devastating consequences for the global economy, which is why countries around the world are looking with increasing concern at actions that are being taken that could disrupt the status quo.""Blinken said U.S. officials ""have a responsibility to defend, protect and advance the interests of the United States and its people, and that is what motivates us in our relationship with China — and for that matter, with any other country."" But ""it would be irresponsible"" to not engage with China, as well as ""counterproductive to our interests,"" he added.Consistent communication is ""the best way to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations that could lead to conflict,"" and it's ""probably the only way"" to get detained Americans back from China, to ""produce cooperation on fentanyl,"" and to ""defend the interests of our workers and our companies who are operating in China.""When asked whether China is replacing the United States as a global conflict mediator, particularly in the Middle East, Blinken said that the U.S. ""remains far and away the preferred partner"" for gulf countries. ""At the same time,"" he added, ""if China takes initiatives that actually help solve problems... that's a good thing, and we support it."" Blinken said some of China's priorities in Ukraine are ""very consistent with our own."" The U.S. would welcome the country taking a mediator role between Ukraine and Russia as long as their efforts helped establish a ""just and durable peace in Ukraine,"" Blinken added.

5445,Three local librarians share their top summer reading picks,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/02/three-local-librarians-share-their-top-summer-reading-picks,"From regency romance to sci-fi thrillers, we gush over our favorite books of 2023 on this annual book club special.","Summer 2023 is upon us, and we're ready to bury our faces in a book we can’t wait to read. As bestselling author Stephen King notes, “books are a uniquely portable magic,” and they're often on the move during the summer months: jammed into jean pockets, lining beach towels, and stacked up on vacation bedside tables. For our annual summer reading special, three local librarians return with their curated lists from 2023’s best offerings — from thrillers to young adult novels, to romance and science fiction. “The book opens right here in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1910, where Agnes Carter, a wealthy donor to a university, which is presumably Harvard, hires a naturalist and glassblowing phenom from Bohemia to create a collection of glass botanical models,” said Susannah Borysthen-Tkacz, senior librarian at the Cambridge Public Library, about one of her summer reading favorites, Glassworks by Olivia Wolfgang-Smith. “Meanwhile, Agnes is struggling with her own suffocating marriage and becomes increasingly enmeshed in this glass artist's life. … And the common thread through all of it is glass. And it sort of is a metaphor for the delicate structure of the family. We see their families shatter and sort of rebuild itself over and over again.”Robin Brenner, teen librarian at the Public Library of Brookline, chose Malcolm Kid and the Perfect Song by Austin Paramore in part because it is written for younger teens: “It plays on the idea of making a deal with the Crossroads Devil, for music, which is something I've always enjoyed as a trope and certainly comes from true jazz mythology and jazz history. And in this case, it's a young man who is trying to prove that he wants to be a musician and, specifically, playing piano, but cannot afford his own keyboard and is kind of desperate to prove to his dad, who's very disapproving of the idea of this as a career. And he reconnects with an old friend from the neighborhood and ends up making a deal that he doesn't realize he's making with this very shady store owner who gives him a keyboard for free. Of course, there is a different price for it.”“There's a king, he has three sons, he sends them out on various, completely ridiculous quests,"" said Veronica Koven-Matasy, reader services librarian at the Boston Public Library, about one of her recommendations, White Cat, Black Dog by Kelly Link. “And the youngest son finds himself at the house of a white cat who mysteriously can talk. And all of her servants are cats, and they mysteriously produce all the things that he needs to succeed in his quest. … He is supposed to bring back a bride. And he says, ‘Oh, I don't really want to bring back a wife.’ And the white cat says, ‘Oh, you bring me.’ And he has to prove his faith in her by cutting off her head when she tells him to. And then immediately a beautiful woman springs out. And, you know, it’s the perfect woman. And obviously he's the superior son who brought back the superior bride. And he gets to be the king. … You enjoy being surprised by stories as well as well as just really enjoying the beautiful prose that's carrying you through.

5550,State Auditor DiZoglio to probe MBTA’s performance,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/03/state-auditor-dizoglio-to-probe-mbtas-performance,But T Advisory Board Director questions need,"Making good on a campaign promise, Massachusetts State Auditor Diana DiZoglio says her office will look into the MBTA’s performance and safety management practices between 2021 and 2022. That’s when a series of collisions, derailments and fires prompted a rare federal investigation into the operation of the agency's subway system.In a statement announcing the audit, DiZoglio said it will focus on “safety risk management and overall areas of improvement,” and she plans to share the findings with Gov. Maura Healey, the state Legislature and the general public. But Brian Kane, the executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, questioned the need for a state audit at this time.“What the T doesn't need right now is more people coming in and telling them what they're not doing,"" Kane told GBH News. ""What they need is people coming in and helping them to do the things they need to do.”Kane said officials already know the T is not performing well.""The reasons for that are very well documented: it's personnel and it's money,"" he said. ""In a lot of cases, it's not a surprise.”In her announcement, DiZoglio said the interest of taxpayers underscored the need for an audit. “Safety issue after issue has arisen and the taxpayers continue to be on the hook,"" she said. ""Taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent.” That appears to be at odds with a Feb. 15 letter sent to state Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca, in which DiZoglio's office described the probe as a “performance audit” and not a financial one. There is a line that provides more detail about the specific scope of the audit, but most it has been redacted. It starts: “Our audit … will include but not be limited to” with the rest of the sentence blacked out. In response to questions from GBH News, a spokesperson for the auditor’s office said that the scope of audits are sometimes redacted to protect their integrity, and that a performance audit can include finances.MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo told GBH News: “We have received this communication and will be cooperating with the state auditor’s office.”",Local,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 14:24:40 EST",e0c89acff4f27489762d7f124b73743c
3681,Life after prison: Mass. leaves thousands of prisoners awaiting education that would help their re-entry,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/20/life-after-prison-mass-leaves-thousands-of-prisoners-awaiting-education-that-would-help-their-re-entry,The state says education is critical. It’s put its money on tablets.,"Aristides Henriquez spent 16 years locked inside a series of Massachusetts state prisons — and, all those years, locked out of educational programming that could have made his life better upon his release. Henriquez wanted to take vocational classes the prison was supposed to offer, but all he did was sit and wait for a seat in a classroom or training program.“I signed up for the welding program. Years and years and years and years went by, and they just never offered it,” the 42-year-old former prisoner said in a telephone interview from Florida, where he now lives with his mother.The barbering program had no space for him, and neither did a college course, he said. All he got was “the run-around.”The vast majority of the roughly 6,000 men and women incarcerated by the state of Massachusetts will be released eventually, and top state officials agree that educating prisoners is key to helping them survive and stay out of trouble when they’re freed. “The best way to reduce recidivism and make somebody successful on the outside is through education,” said Department of Correction Commissioner Carol Mici in March at a roundtable discussion in Roslindale with about 20 corrections officials, volunteer educators and some formerly incarcerated men.But in reality only a minority of state prisoners are getting into classes. An incarcerated person is nearly four times more likely to be on a waitlist than enrolled in a class that could help them find work upon their release, according to data obtained by GBH News. Some 3,100 state prisoners — more than half of all those incarcerated in Massachusetts prisons — were waiting to get into academic, vocational or technology classes last fall, records show. About 850, or just 15% of prisoners, were actually enrolled in a class. And instead of boosting programs, the state Department of Correction is moving away from in-person classes and relying more on online learning, the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found. Last fall, the correctional department opted not to reapply for more than $2 million in state educational grants that support prison programs. Those state grants covered 80% of the DOC’s expenses for educational programs at a high school level or below, according to data compiled by a special legislative commission on correctional spending. State prison officials declined to be interviewed for this story, and failed to respond to document requests for details on some of the programs. Corrections officials also declined to appear before the state Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee last December to answer questions about education. Instead, the department sent a detailed statement Saturday saying that GBH News was missing critical context. They argue that many people in prison are not eligible for or even interested in taking classes, and others may be enrolled in social skills training or other pre-release programming that limits the time they have availble for classes. They also contend that the state is actively trying to expand educational opportunities.The lack of education and training programs is seen as a key failure in Massachusetts to preparing prisoners for life outside the walls — even as officials tout such education as important for their success. Several current and former prisoners, like Henriquez, and their advocates told GBH News they wait for years for training opportunities. Maria Valerio of Clinton says she requested data on waitlists because she was so appalled by the lack of opportunities for prisoners. “Massachusetts is such a highly educated state ... and we have so much money that we’re putting into the prisons. And yet you can’t educate people,” said Valerio, a prison activist involved with the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ. “I think it’s disgraceful.” Policymakers in several recent reports also point to structural racism in the system: the miniscule rates of inmates accessing college classes, almost no services for young prisoners with special educational needs and limited access to educational programming disproportionately affect prisoners of color. Even those who got some training maintain it’s insufficient. Jose Bueno, 36, told GBH News he was released on parole last year after 16 years in prison, in part because the parole board concluded he had “completed vocational training.” But Bueno says he was repeatedly denied access to other vocational classes that led to a professional certification. “I was on the welding program list for 10 years and ... I never got in,” he said. Instead, he went to work for a prison workshop that builds park benches and other commercial products. He says he learned useful skills, but he never received a certificate he was promised. “I was just, like, working in a sweatshop,” he said. Bueno said he has no documentation to show a potential employer that he had been trained in the work. A year after his release, he says he is still bouncing between temp jobs while trying to get a foothold in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. He says he can’t get stable housing until he gets a stable job. “I’m hanging on by a thread, you know, and I don’t know where to turn,” he said. At the roundtable meeting in March, Commissioner Mici sold the idea of educating Massachusetts prisoners with tablet computers, pre-loaded with educational materials that they can use to study on their own. The state has already spent $14 million on the devices, which started being distributed last year. “When you’re in your room yourself, you can always be working on education. You don’t have to wait to go to that classroom Monday, Wednesday, Friday for an hour, because that’s unfortunately sometimes all you get in the department because of space, because of waitlists,” Mici said. The department said in its statement to GBH News that ""Tablets have not replaced any teachers for any of our programs and the goal is to accentuate the learning experience and offer more enrichment opportunities through programming on tablets.""But advocates and some current state prisoners said studying on a tablet falls way short of meaningful education. Dwight Williams, an inmate at the state prison in Norfolk, told GBH News that it’s almost impossible to use a tablet in a prison cell. “The WiFi sucks,” he said. “You have to stand out in the hallway to get a signal.” Ann Jacobs, former executive director of the John Jay College Institute for Justice and Opportunity at the City University of New York, said online programs can complement education. But she said they can’t do the work of a live teacher — especially for adult learners whose earlier school experiences often were negative. “We want to get knowledge and experience that’s going to equip us to get a job, do fulfilling work and make a living in the community,” she said. “A tablet-based education that you do on your own in a cell doesn’t do any of that.” Karen DeCoster, a former corrections education specialist with the state Office of Adult and Community Learning Services, also said most prisoners need to be in a classroom to benefit from education. “More than anybody, they need the opportunity to learn social skills, to learn how to interact with each other, how to self-monitor and manage their behavior in group settings,” said DeCoster, who once oversaw educational grants to the DOC. “These are transferable skills for employment and further education.” Lizz Matos, the executive director of the local advocacy group Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, says the purchase of tablets is a “welcome development.” But the scale of the investment compared to DOC’s overall programming budget “should make clear that programming and education have not been prioritized.”“Tablets should be utilized to supplement out-of-cell programming, education, and vocational training that is robust,” Matos told GBH News in a statement. “We hope that DOC spending going forward will prioritize rehabilitative programming so that people can get out and stay out of prison.” Prisoners themselves are begging for more training. In a report distributed in January by Prisoners’ Legal Services, men incarcerated in three state prisons complained that the DOC had cut back on vocational certifications for a series of programs — including welding, carpentry and plumbing — that could lead to stable jobs outside the walls. “There are classrooms in almost every DOC facility that regularly sit empty hours out of each day,” prisoners wrote. “It should be the goal of the DOC education division to have learning activities occurring in every classroom, at every available movement time, every day.”In the 2020 fiscal year, the state Department of Correction spent just 2% of its $732 million operating budget on programming for inmates, according to a legislative commission’s study of DOC spending. That study also concluded that the state corrections agency can’t clearly account for how its resources are used, or the outcomes produced. One side effect of the DOC’s decision to walk away from state educational grants is that it also spares the agency from oversight by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which has found major flaws in prison education programs. An internal education draft report from 2018, obtained by GBH News, found that only 26% of incarcerated students enrolled in high school–level or below programs at five DOC prisons and five county jails made a “measurable learning gain,” like earning a high school equivalency certification. DeCoster, whose was based out of the state’s education department, said DOC officials bristled at such scrutiny. “It was really questionable whether or not a curriculum was being followed,” she said. “They would show us a written curriculum, but then we would see no evidence of it when we went in to monitor. So we would try to have conversations around what’s really happening here. And people didn’t like being questioned.” The department said in its statement that it walked away from the grants because the program was not really designed to be implemented in prisons and it required too much paperwork. Nevertheless, “The DOC continues to provide the same level services, classroom instruction, and programs to more than 800 learners without the grant.”The Department of Correction does understand how to provide inmates a quality educational experience — and sees its value.Housed inside a pre-release center in Roslindale is what the state calls its School of Reentry. The program, launched in 2016, is meant to immerse prisoners nearing release in education and an array of social services not generally available systemwide. “We found that around the DOC, a guy might get an educational program for an hour a day, or an hour a week. Whatever it was, it wasn’t enough,” the program’s co-founder Alan Spencer told a March roundtable of corrections officials, incarcerated students and some who had completed the program.Instead, the School of Reentry offers six hours of daily classroom instruction in subject areas that lead to the equivalent of a high school diploma, or a vocational training program in computer programming. Lasting up to 18 months, the pre-release prison facility also provides counseling for substance abuse, mental health and employment. Participants, sharing their stories at the event in March, said they were grateful for the chance at an education.Roberto Rivera said when he was incarcerated at MCI-Norfolk, there was no education available, only waitlists. And Kenneth Gumes said he’d been in and out of Massachusetts prisons for more than 20 years before winning a spot at the Roslindale program in 2017 — which has helped him stay clean and sober. “I never got any rehabilitation until they invented the School of Reentry,” he said at the roundtable. “The Department of Corrections didn’t do too much for me but house me and throw me back out in society.” State data show results are promising. More than 80% of students who have attended the program earned a high school equivalency. And of those released to the community from the program, only 9% ended up back in the criminal justice system. This is far below the state’s 33% recidivism rate over three years. And also not surprising: Nationally, prisoners who receive education or vocational training are 43% less likely to be put back in prison in that timeframe and stand a better chance at finding a job than their peers who didn’t see such opportunities, according to a 2013 RAND Corporation report. “We’re getting them ready to hit the streets. We’re getting them ready for life beyond here,” said Lisa Millwood, the School of Reentry’s director. “It gets started while they're here so that we're able to provide all the support, love and care that they need before they have to do it on their own.” But the reach of the School of Reentry is limited. So far only 100 students have graduated. The school has room for just 25 people and has only run four cohorts since opening. The Department of Correction intends to double the capacity of this program, but that will still serve just a sliver of the total population.At the same time, officials from universities across the state tell GBH News they are practically banging on the prison doors trying to get in to teach eligible students. Last fall, 213 incarcerated people in Massachusetts state prisons were taking some college-level courses from five colleges and universities running programs behind bars, according to a report from The Boston Foundation. That’s less than 4% of the total incarcerated population. “It has been a missed opportunity,” said Mneesha Gellman, who directs the Emerson Prison Initiative and co-authored the foundation’s report. “We are, in this state, world-famous for higher education, and yet we’re not extending that even when the benefits of higher educational access for incarcerated people are so clear.” One of the biggest barriers is the lack of dedicated learning spaces inside DOC prisons, Gellman’s report found. Basic needs such as classrooms, libraries, computer labs, and meeting space for office hours with professors would be available if prison leadership saw higher education as a priority, the report said. Authors also found that the DOC practice of suddenly relocating or reclassifying prisoners disrupts learning and enrollment. Jose Bueno was one of the lucky ones: he got a college degree in prison. Bueno says he got into the classes taught by Boston University, but that was largely despite, not because of, the Department of Correction. “That was B.U. on its own. And I had a push for that. I had to get it on my own,” he said. And then DOC staff told him that the degree disqualified him from the prison’s vocational classes, classes he believes would be more useful to him now that he is desperate to get a job with no real resume.Bueno said he considers his college degree a huge accomplishment. “That is the one thing in my life that I am truly proud of,” he said. “It built up my confidence to where I know I can learn how to do anything.” But he said that it has been no help in trying to find a job since leaving prison.Massachusetts pales in providing college classes to prisoners compared to some nearby states. In Maine prisons, the per-capita rate of inmates taking college classes is four times higher than Massachusetts, based on data provided by the Maine Department of Corrections. And in New York’s prison system, the rate is two times greater than Massachusetts, according to New York state numbers. (New York has far more prisoners than Massachusetts, and Maine has far fewer.)It wasn’t always like this. In the nearly four decades that former prisoner Joseph Jabir Pope was incarcerated inside Massachusetts prisons, he says he watched the state gradually abandon education programs.“The programs that are available, for the most part, ... are hollowed out,” Pope told state lawmakers last December at a Joint Judiciary Committee hearing on criminal justice reforms. In 2004, a corrections reform commission created under then-Gov. Mitt Romney documented how prior administrations had rolled back educational programs in state prisons. In 1991, Gov. William Weld moved the corrections agency from Health and Human Services to what is now the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. The move came in the midst of a tough-on-crime approach and marks what prison reform advocates say was DOC’s shift from a rehabilitation model to one focused on punishment.“[T]he DOC cut back in-prison education and programs significantly, which resulted in the layoff of 36 full time teachers and the elimination of several vocational programs,” the Romney-era report stated. “The Commission heard repeatedly that since the deep program cuts, the demand for education and programming has greatly outweighed the supply.” The 19-year-old report went on to criticize the changes, saying that it failed to reflect “’what works’ in successfully preparing offenders for law-abiding lives post-release.” There’s renewed hope for expanded opportunities for college education behind bars with the return of federal Pell Grant funding for the incarcerated. The federal money, which was taken out of prisons under President Bill Clinton, will be restored this July. But only if corrections agencies remove barriers. For one thing, the programs need to meet federal criteria for prisoners to receive the grants. The department says it is expanding college classes, but the physical infrastructure in prisons provides limited classroom space. State Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a chair on the judiciary committee, told GBH News that the DOC has a track record at the “superintendent level” of resisting expansion of college programming inside its walls. “There’s just this cultural sort of opposition to more education,” he said. “When colleges have tried to expand in some of our prisons, they’re just either met with silence or opposition.” Eldridge also said many programs are lacking in real-world needs. “Why aren’t there programs to train people to go into clean energy or solar installation, higher-level trade jobs, computer programing?” he asked. “Those are jobs that clearly the workforce is in need of.”Aristides Henriquez, who said he is unemployed and seeing a mental health therapist for PTSD, agrees. He said people returning home from prison need these skills to build stable lives in their communities. Otherwise, they are tempted to fall back into selling drugs or other criminal activity. “You end up doing such a long time and it’s like, at least if you could learn something there, you would have a fighting chance when you get to the street,” said Henriquez. “You get back out here and you're stuck not knowing anything — the same as you went in. And then it becomes a reoccurring thing, going back into the prison system.”Have a tip or a comment about education in prisons, or reentering society after prison, in Massachusetts?

7372,"The Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspaper, changes hands after six decades",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/02/the-bay-state-banner-bostons-oldest-black-owned-newspaper-changes-hands-after-six-decades,The Banner’s new owners plan to expand multimedia content while promising to honor the paper’s legacy and mission.,"Running a local newspaper for more than half a century is no small feat, but Melvin Miller isn’t one to brag. “The question of legacy is always for other people to decide,” Miller said. “I’m just a ditch digger. I just do the work.” After nearly six decades, Miller says it’s time for someone new to take over his life’s work: the Bay State Banner, Boston’s oldest Black-owned newspaper. Miller announced Wednesday he is handing the paper over to new owners as part of a larger expansion and redesign of the publication. The new owners, Ron Mitchell and Andre Stark, are veteran journalists with close ties to their Boston communities and long-standing family relationships with 88-year-old Miller, a Roxbury native. “We’re journalists, we’re filmmakers, but we’re also people who have been telling the truth about our community,” Mitchell said. “We’re going to take [The Banner] into the next half a century. We’re going to transition it in many different ways to make it more amenable to a younger audience.” Mitchell, 61, who previously worked at GBH News, resigned last week from a nearly 30-year career at WBZ-TV to prepare for his role as publisher and editor of the Banner, a return to his roots. Mitchell’s family — including his aunt Jean McGuire, a former METCO director — had generations of ties to the Miller family. “We are living up to the responsibility that our families birthed us into,” Mitchell said, “to take responsibility for the communication in our community.”Stark, 63, who will serve as the paper’s chief operating officer, is another GBH veteran who produced documentary films for PBS documentary series Frontline and NOVA. He serves as a board member at the Roxbury-based Center for Teen Empowerment, a nonprofit that provides resources to young people from local communities of color. Stark says he read the Banner as a child, the son of West-Indian parents who steeped him in Black cultural history and enrolled him in school at the Freedom House established by Otto and Muriel Snowden. His mother, a close friend of Miller’s, brought Stark to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s march from his Roxbury neighborhood to the Boston Common in 1965. “I think one of the reasons Mel felt comfortable transferring the mantle over to us is that he knows both of our families,” Stark said. “It helps close the circle as he knows both of us from years ago.” Kenneth Cooper, another GBH News veteran with decades of experience at newsrooms including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Dispatch, will join the Banner as an editorial consultant, overseeing a major expansion and transformation that lies ahead. Longtime Banner senior editor Yawu Miller has agreed to stay on (despite his uncle's departure) to manage the Boston edition of the paper. Financing for the transition came from private contributions from community members around Greater Boston and the Mill Cities Community Investment, a community development financial institution based in Lawrence. Both Miller and the new owners declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Within the next year, the Banner plans to distribute in other regional markets, including Connecticut, Rhode Island and Northern parts of Massachusetts, and positions will open for bureau chiefs in those areas, Mitchell said. The change of guard comes with plans for a new website and app, weekly 30-minute investigative news shows, wider coverage of sports and local business briefs. The expansion of online content will be overseen by Colin Redd, a 30-year-old Boston native who helps run Blavity, a Black-owned media company with an understanding of young audiences. The new website will include community services including access to loan applications, scholarships, a calendar of community events and other educational resources, Mitchell said. “It’s going to be an interactive resource, a portal of opportunities,” Mitchell said. “The website will be true community outreach, not just a physical rendition of the paper.” The goal, Mitchell says, is to reach new audiences and expand coverage while preserving the publication’s integrity as a source of local news for communities of color. “This is an extension of African-American culture going back hundreds of years, community storytelling that transformed into Black publishing,” Mitchell said. “Dating back to emancipation, Black papers told the truth about the Black community.” The Banner has always stood out as a source of straightforward information, Mitchell says, representing an on-the-ground approach to issues directly impacting communities of color. “The Black community is not a monolith,” he said. “That's why it is important to have a paper that understands the complexity of our community and tells us that's the only way you get the true story.”Miller founded the Banner in 1965 to fill a void left by the folding of The Guardian, a newspaper led by civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter. His goal was never objectivity — an idea he dismisses as “nonsense” — but to be fair and honest, and to help readers understand “the complexity of American society” with nuance and clarity. “People would come up to me sometimes and ask me why we didn’t cover some shooting, and I said, 'Hey, there are many places you can find that,'” Miller said. “I’m not going to spend ten cents of my budget giving any attention to a brutal government. Not going to happen.” Miller’s hope for the paper is the continuation of his work highlighting the fabric of life in communities of color, emphasizing “positive, helpful and uplifting” coverage whenever possible. “If we focus on the wrong things perpetually, then what we're doing is we are building that culture around those ideas, on the ugly angels,” Miller said. “I like to appeal to people’s beautiful angels.”",Local,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 07:07:13 EST",057a2b200ca4358fd493071b966389f9
2868,Mass. RMV sees big spike in learner's permits following new law,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/10/mass-rmv-sees-big-spike-in-learners-permits-following-new-law,"Starting July 1, undocumented immigrants who live in Massachusetts can apply for driver's licenses.","The state has issued more than double the number of learner's permits in the last 10 days than this time last year, after a law went into effect July 1 allowing undocumented immigrants who live in Massachusetts to apply for driver's licenses.The Registry of Motor Vehicles has issued 2,800 learner's permits so far in July, Gov. Maura Healey said during a press conference at the RMV's Haymarket location in Boston.The registry is expecting even more demand in the upcoming week, as residents get back into the swing of things after a popular vacation week for the Fourth of July, said RMV Registrar of Motor Vehicles Colleen Ogilvie.Under the law, which the Legislature enacted over Gov. Charlie Baker's veto last year and then was upheld in November with 54 percent of voters supporting it, all Massachusetts residents who are old enough will be eligible to apply for standard driver's licenses, regardless of their immigration status.Immigrants who do not have legal status in the United States will need to submit other documents -- including either a valid, unexpired foreign passport or a valid, unexpired consular identification document -- to prove their identity, date of birth and current residency.Former Gov. Charlie Baker wrote in his veto of the law that the RMV ""does not have the expertise or ability to verify the validity of many types of documents from other countries."" Healey on Monday gave no indications of any problems.""I think we've gotten off to a strong start, wouldn't you say? It's been really, I think, great out of the gate,"" Healey said.In the buildup to the July 1 implementation date, the RMV staffed up and has been translating application materials and permits. The RMV also extended its hours, open now from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and with seven locations newly open on Saturdays for license-related matters.Ogilvie said there was not a major increase in the number of people using these extended hours, but that the registry anticipates more demand coming off the holiday week, and as more people know to begin applying for their learner's permits.She also said there is currently no end-date for these extended hours, and that the RMV would be open 8-6 and on Saturdays ""for the foreseeable future.""""We changed all our leases to be able to follow this model for the next one or two years,"" she said.Though the RMV has expanded its hours to accommodate the nearly 200,000 undocumented immigrants that all became eligible to apply for a driver's license at once on July 1, anyone can make an appointment at the registry during these newly-open times.Ogilvie said she could not provide a breakdown of how many of the 2,800 learner's permits issued over the last week and a half were newly-eligible undocumented immigrants.Asked for this breakdown, Ogilvie said ""We will not be able to answer that because the law prohibits us from looking at the data that way. From our perspective, it is all people that have gotten a new permit, whether it's a 16-year-old for the first time, or an adult that is suddenly now obtaining a license.""On average, about 120,000 people in Massachusetts get a driver's license for the first time each year, according to MassDOT. If all 200,000 newly-eligible undocumented immigrants apply for a driver's license, their applications would far exceed the typical number of first-time drivers.A Department of Transportation official said on Thursday that the RMV had received over 42,000 total requests for permits -- regardless of an applicant's immigration status -- since the law's implementation five days earlier. The department did not provide data indicating how these requests compared to the number of people who requested permits during the same week last year.As part of the RMV's expansion in preparation of new drivers, license applications are now available in 15 different languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Vietnamese. The RMV is encouraging those who do not speak English to bring an interpreter for their road tests. If they do not have anyone who can interpret for them, the registry will provide an interpreter, Ogilvie said.The registry and the Driving Families Forward Coalition, who lobbied for the new law, have set up tents outside of RMVs around the state with interpreters available to help people with the application process.""On Monday the third, we had two Brazilian gentlemen that were the first to get their permits, and we were excited to be out there cheering them on,"" said Chrystel Murrieta, co-chair of the coalition, with 32BJ SEIU.The governor recommended $28 million in funding to the RMV for expenses related to registry expansions to accommodate the new law, but RMV fees from new applicants may counterbalance the spending, the Executive Office of Administration and Finance has said.Healey told reporters on Monday that the licenses granted to undocumented immigrants would be valid and honored in other states.""These are Massachusetts driver's licenses,"" she said.The governor also warned that there are scams targeting people seeking driver's licenses.""You should only book your appointment and pay your fees through the RMV,"" she said. ""If something doesn't feel right, in terms of what people are seeing out there, contact the Attorney General's Office.""",Local,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 17:33:47 EST",4ff085fad5cc9bba979fee58ebe74f22
4527,Do you copy? Massachusetts native and mission commander Stephen Bowen calls in to GBH from the space station,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/03/21/do-you-copy-massachusetts-native-and-commander-stephen-bowen-calls-in-to-gbh-from-the-space-station,"Bowen, originally from Cohasset, is leading the the NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 on the International Space Station. He’ll come back down to Earth this fall.","At GBH, we've had the pleasure of speaking with all kinds of leaders, change-makers and innovators in our community. We get to challenge our elected leaders and speak with seasoned experts — all of which are abundant in the Greater Boston area. But one thing we've never done is interview someone in space. So we jumped at the opportunity to speak with Cohasset native Stephen Bowen. He’s the commander for NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 who’s been at the International Space Station with three other crew members for a few weeks now. He spoke with GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about life at the International Space Station. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: The first question I have to ask you is: tell me what you’re seeing right now. Or if you’re not at a window, what would you be seeing right now?Stephen Bowen: Right now, I think we’re heading out over the Atlantic Ocean. We just passed over South America and are heading up toward the African coast on a 51.6-degree inclination. If you watch a satellite map, we’re heading up from South America to Africa. Rath: You’re up there with your new crew. Do you feel like you’re settled yet? Bowen: Not yet. It’s funny because my longest previous mission was about 16 days, so we’ve already passed that. You know, we’re starting to get settled in, and we feel like we kind of know what we’re doing, but we’re not really comfortable. Some of the guys who’ve been here obviously a lot longer than us, so it takes about a month to six weeks or so before you really feel like this is somewhat normal. Conversely, it takes about that long when you get back to Earth to feel like Earth is normal. Rath: When you get up there with a new crew, do you have overlap with the existing crew? How does that work? Bowen: Yeah. When we got up here, Crew-5 was still on board, so those four crew members and us four, and then three on the Soyuz [spacecraft]. So we had 11 people up here, which — even though the station’s pretty big, it’s an operating lab — the actual habitable volume in the places where people live is relatively small, so it seems crowded.When Crew-5 left a week or so ago, it seemed a lot emptier. They were incredibly helpful during our turnover and explainimg how things operate and how things work, which was great to have. We try to shoot for that. When we get some of that turnover, the learning curve is a lot [less steep] if you’re able to pass on your knowledge. Rath: I want to ask you a bit about your background. I’m wondering if when you’re looking out that window, if you see Massachusetts, do you ever think about that kid growing up in Cohasset, and did he ever dream of going to space?Bowen: Yeah, actually, I have done that! When I was very young — I’m old enough to have watched as we first stepped foot on the moon — I remember watching that on a black-and-white TV in our house in Cohasset. So the concept of becoming an astronaut was just sort of fantastic to me. I never really set it out as a career goal, but I just kind of went along, studied as hard as I could and always took the opportunities I could to learn more. On the path I took, I ended up as an officer in the Nuclear Submarine Corps. I applied from there, and I was fortunate enough to get selected. So it was a dream from when I was a little kid, but it wasn’t something I planned on during my early-adult career. But it’s been a fantastic 23 years so far, and it’s pretty amazing.Rath: Like those classic Apollo astronauts that you were watching on TV, you followed the Navy route.Bowen: Yes, I did. When I talk to students, I kind of emphasize the fact that what you do in high school, etcetera, if you’re having difficulty in a class or something, spend a little extra time and focus on that so you can bring your grades up and learn. Because the teachers are teaching us this stuff for a reason, so I kind of got that attitude fairly early on because I was not a good reader at first. By the time I got to be a senior in high school, I got to choose where I wanted to go to school, and the U.S. Naval Academy seemed like a great engineering school, so I went there. And it was the same thing there — I did well enough that I was able to select the Submarine Corps upon graduation. I continued to work. When you do that, you get to choose the opportunities you have, and it’s pretty exciting. It led me to the opportunity to apply to become an astronaut, which isn’t like that because there are so many qualified people. I felt like I won the lottery when I got selected.Rath: Well, you must have done well since then because you’re now commanding this mission. Is this your first mission as a commander? Bowen: Yes, my three previous missions were all shuttle missions. I basically came up to the International Space Station as a construction worker, as a contractor, helping build the International Space Station. So I have the opportunity now to live in this house, and it’s pretty amazing.Rath: Tell us a bit more about your mission. First off, the team that you’re leading is an international team.Bowen: Yeah, this is an amazing group. We’ve got three Russian cosmonauts on board. We brought one of them up with us on the SpaceX Dragon, and we have a United Arab Emirates astronaut, as well, on his first long-duration flight from the Emirates. It’s really exciting to have such a diverse group of people on board.Rath: Tell us about what your goals are and what you hope to accomplish on this.Bowen: Well, it is a national laboratory, so there are several hundred experiments going on all around us pretty much at all times. Some of them run pretty much autonomously, a lot of them require our input — our activity — to help keep them going. ... There’s a lot of sampling and just maintaining the stations.But really, what we’re doing is continuing the operation of this laboratory, this incredible asset for science that’s been manned since October of 2000. So almost 23 years now, we’ve had people permanently living in space. That’s pretty exciting in and of itself. But the research is really the goal.Rath: With all of that, it sounds like the work could never stop. How does your typical day go on the International Space Station?Bowen: Well, there’s a couple of things that are really important. They want to make sure you get enough sleep, so they do schedule a block of time for sleep. You want to get about eight hours if you can. That’s hard on the ground, and it’s hard up here. You also have to work out and do load-bearing exercises for two hours every day to ensure that you maintain your bone density and muscle mass. You have to find time to eat and take care of all of those other issues that go along with living, so you end up with about 8- to 10-hour workdays scheduled over 12 hours because you can’t put things right on top of each other. So it’s a long day, and sometimes you do end up working weekends, which is good — you’re always doing something useful and exciting.If you get a chance to look at our schedule, you can see what we do on a daily basis. You’ll see we don’t get a whole lot of spare time, which is why it’s so important to get weekends and get that opportunity for some downtime to recover, to continue the pace.Rath: Your crew went up on the International Space Station on a SpaceX spacecraft. Tell me about that, how it’s been learning to use new hardware like that. Bowen: Oh, it’s so different because I grew up on the space shuttle. When I got the astronaut office, I did three shuttle flights, and I was the flight engineer for my first flight. We had hundreds of switches and circuit breakers and dials and knobs and displays that really required some manual intervention at different points in order to make things happen. The Dragon spacecraft is almost entirely automated, so in reality, we’re monitoring systems. Our input, our interface is not those switches and circuit breakers — it’s a touch screen. So it’s incredibly different, an incredibly capable machine, and it’s doing its job well for us so far.Rath: Will you use the Dragon capsule to get home, or does the outgoing crew use that?Bowen: We’ll use our own capsule heading home in about six months or so. You splash down in the ocean, similar to the way they did in the Apollo days. And that’s because the weather constraints are pretty tight, so that’s one reason Crew-5 was here for a few extra days with us. You’ve gotta make sure the weather’s safe to come home, and that’s how we’ll be getting home in about five or six months.Rath: Speaking of new hardware, I have to imagine this is a pretty exciting time to be an astronaut with the coming plans from NASA. There are going to be additional moon missions. So as someone who grew up watching those Apollo missions, tell me what it feels like.Bowen: It’s been incredibly exciting, and it’s been getting more and more exciting over the past half decade or so. Once the Artemis Mission started to become more realistic, commercial crew came online and brought that other set of vehicles and commercial crew vehicles. We’ve got SpaceX; hopefully, we’ll get Boeing up here soon. That’s incredibly exciting, incredibly amazing to see. And now, with Artemis and Gateway and potential missions to the moon, it’s absolutely amazing. I have friends that have been at NASA a lot longer than me, and they will tell you that this is the most exciting time they’ve ever had at NASA.Rath: Is there a kind of dissonance or a real contrast when you’re docking the Dragon spacecraft at the International Space Station, which has now been manned for over 20 years now. Bowen: It’s pretty amazing. I came through the hatch, and it looks familiar to when I left it 10, 12 years ago. But it’s just so much busier. Having that extra crew member that the Dragon capsule provides just adds that much more capability to the laboratory itself, and it’s really exciting. It’s an incredibly bustling place, and that’s great to see. Rath: Stephen, our time has just flown by — you can probably tell how much I’m loving talking to you about all of this. Before we have to let you go, is there anything you want to say to your friends and family back here on Earth and in Massachusetts?Bowen: I’d like to say hello! I’m really enjoying the weather up here. I know the weather down there has been tough at times these past few months. I guess it was cold and dreary yesterday. I’m looking forward to getting home in the fall time frame. After we get back to Houston and I get some recovery, I’m probably going to head back up to New England and head up to see family in Boston. So it’s going to be exciting. And, you know, maybe we’ll have an NBA and NHL championship to celebrate, as well.",Science and Technology,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 18:53:24 EST",7657993ff0a665fa9c4dde9f80ca6a0c
1794,Bruce Brown's road to the NBA Finals began in Boston and Wakefield,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/12/bruce-browns-road-to-the-nba-finals-began-in-boston-and-wakefield,Brown has been a key member of the Denver Nuggets run to the Finals.,"The first time Brendan Kent laid eyes on Bruce Brown on a basketball court, he knew he was in trouble. Kent, who is now the director of athletics for Wakefield Public Schools, was on the coaching staff at Melrose High School when he was assigned to go scout rival Wakefield Memorial High School during Brown’s freshman year there. What he saw next he’ll never forget.“So, I go to the Wakefield gym, I sit down and literally just as I sit down, [Brown] steals the ball on defense, goes the length of the court and just goes up and slams it in, dunk. As a freshman,” he said. “And I just remember immediately texting the head coach saying, ‘We have a problem.’”The now key member of the Denver Nuggets has plenty of stories just like that in his journey to the NBA Finals. Brown is averaging 11.8 points per game coming off the bench for Denver so far in this year’s NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, including a scorching Game 4 performance on Friday where he racked up 21 points, including 11 points in the fourth quarter, on 8 of 11 shot attempts and made two free throws to help put the Nuggets within one win of the franchise’s first ever NBA championship.But just like any NBA player, Brown’s success didn’t start in the arena. The Dorchester native's foundation started on courts in Boston and Wakefield, where he spent his first two years of high school, where many friends and coaches knew he’d be special. Brad Simpson was the longtime head coach at Wakefield when Brown came there through the METCO program, though Simpson says Brown was originally going to enroll at school in Milton. But when Brown’s mother was told there wouldn’t be enough room on the bus for both Brown and his younger brother, she sent them to Wakefield instead.“So, I don’t play the lottery anymore,” Simpson said. “‘Cause I won it when Bruce switched schools and came to Wakefield.”Brown only spent two seasons at Wakefield before heading off to Vermont Academy and eventually the University of Miami for college. But in that short time, Simpson already had an idea of what kind of player Brown would become. One day before practice his freshman year, the coach had a foretelling conversation with Brown. “I sat him down and I said, ‘Bruce, this is how it’s gonna work. If you don’t know this already, I’m gonna watch you on TV someday.’ I was thinking Division I college basketball, I wasn’t thinking professional basketball,” Simpson said with a laugh. “And I said, ‘You can’t stay at Wakefield, I know how it works. Hopefully, we’ll have you for a couple of years, but some prep school’s gonna scoop you up, you’re gonna reclassify and then you’re gonna go to a DI school. So that’s the plan.’ And that’s pretty much what happened.”Although he played high school ball outside the city, Brown’s legacy in Boston is much the same as it is in Wakefield. Leo Papile founded the Boston Amateur Basketball Club, a youth program, in 1977. Since then, the BABC has included future NBA players like Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing, Brown, Georges Niang of the Philadelphia 76ers, Terance Mann of the Los Angeles Clippers and others.Papile said Brown will be in the program’s hall of fame. The BABC stresses a “we, not me” mentality, something Papile’s seen Brown has carried to the pros, as he has stayed in touch with many of his early teammates.“You know, those significant team accomplishments I think is how he’d want his obituary [written], you know, for the basketball game,” Papile said. “Not that he was averaging 'x' amount of points or he had [21 points] in a big fourth quarter explosion in a ... fourth game of a championship. I think he’d rather see it that he was a member of an NBA champion, you know, knowing him as well as we do.”Even though everyone could see Brown’s potential growing up, it’s not every day you see someone you know drop buckets in the Finals. For Brad Simpson, watching his former pupil excel on the game’s biggest stage has been a pinch-me moment.“You’ve gotta kind of sit back and you take stock and say, ‘Holy s***, this is a guy that I coached!’” Simpson said. “It’s like, I’m not looking at him like a coach, I’m looking at him like a fan. I mean, I’m in his fan club. I’m a card-carrying member of Bruce Brown’s fan club.”Brown spent two seasons a piece as a bit of a nomad with the Detroit Pistons and the Brooklyn Nets before finding a professional home in the Rocky Mountains. And while the Finals are where big names like Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray shine, it’s players like Brown that can help push a series over the edge. Speaking after his Game 4 performance, Brown said the journey he’s had wasn’t too heavy on his mind“I knew coming into the league what I could do. It was just, a team had to give me a chance,” Brown said to the Boston Globe’s Gary Washburn. “And [former Detroit Pistons coach] Dwane Casey did. I started my rookie year, I did very well. So, I thank him for that. But now, doing that on this stage, it’s amazing. But I’ll think about it when we’re done.”",Local,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 12:04:49 EST",e9cca21351e0cb57cc3037c8bcbfccf9
6634,Healey's proposed budget a boon to education and the environment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/healeys-proposed-budget-a-boon-to-education-and-the-environment,Moves to safeguard funds from the 'millionaire's tax'.,"Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday filed a $55.5 billion state budget that proposes a major boost for environmental and energy agencies, locks in tuition rates for Massachusetts students at state universities, and provides free phone calls for people in state prisons. “Today, we wanted to present a budget that will set Massachusetts up for success by lowering costs, growing our economy and delivering on the promise of our people,” Healey said. “Together, we’re putting forth ambitious goals and historic, significant investments.” Healey’s budget for the 2024 fiscal year would increase spending by about 4% over this year’s budget, and it creates a dedicated trust fund for revenue from the state’s new tax on incomes over $1 million. Voters approved that tax at the ballot last November, and the money it generates is dedicated to education and transportation causes. Healey is planning to split $1 billion in millionaire’s tax revenue roughly evenly between education and transportation, with a substantial chunk of it — $360 million — going towards higher education. “Our public higher ed grads, they’re our future teachers and nurses and business owners and accountants and entrepreneurs,” said Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, a Salem State University graduate. “The majority of folks graduating from our public higher ed institutions, they stay right here in the commonwealth.” Healey is proposing to use $59 million of the millionaire’s tax money for what she’s calling “tuition stabilization” in the public higher education system — in-state undergraduates at the UMass campuses and state universities would pay the same tuition rates throughout their four years, rather than facing annual increases. UMass President Marty Meehan said the tuition certainty ""will help our students and their families plan for the cost of a UMass education while encouraging more students to finish their degree in four years, both of which will result in a more affordable degree.""Other goals Healey has in mind for the surtax revenue include reducing waitlists for child care subsidies, expanding early college programs, creating a new grant to help fund municipal transportation projects, and stepping up investments in highway bridge preservation. Healey also wants to steer some of this money to regional transit authorities and to the MBTA, where it will help cover start-up costs for a means-tested fare program to make the T less expensive for people with lower incomes. Healey’s budget also: Requires the Department of Correction to provide up to 1,000 minutes a month of free phone calls, estimated to cost $20 million. Lawmakers advanced no-cost calls legislation last year, but couldn’t get former Gov. Charlie Baker on board.Increases funding for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs by 24%, including money for 240 new staff members. The major funding hike prompted Sen. Mike Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy and Utilities Committee, to call Healey's plan ""the best executive branch budget I've ever seen"" and ""a leap over anything a governor has proposed before."" Includes $324 million for the emergency assistance family shelter program, a 48% increase. The Healey administration says the program is expected to serve 338 new families a month in fiscal 2024. Delivers on a promise she made in her inaugural address by including $20 million to make community college free for eligible students age 25 and older. State financial aid already exists to defray the cost of community college, and Healey’s office says the MassReconnect scholarships “would offer students last-dollar financial support to cover the cost of tuition, fees, books and supplies as well as provide funding for career and wraparound support services to encourage retention and degree completion.” Alongside her budget, Healey also formally filed the $742 million tax-break package she announced Monday and a bill to add a dedicated housing secretary in her cabinet. Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Healey’s budget shows the state remains in a strong financial condition, giving the administration high marks for its tax relief plan, early education investments and what he called a “transparent approach to tracking and using surtax revenue.” The Raise Up Massachusetts Coalition, which campaigned for the surtax, said Healey deserves credit for making sure that money is spent as intended on education and transportation. The coalition has knocked Healey's proposal to reform the estate tax and reduce the tax rate on short-term capital gains, assets held for a year or less. ""While the Governor’s budget proposes several meaningful new initiatives, it doesn't come close to making the investments necessary to address our workforce challenges, tackle our broken childcare system, end the housing affordability crisis, or fix the MBTA and build a 21st century statewide transportation system,"" the coalition said in a statement.Healey’s budget represents a starting point in a process that will stretch for months. The House, in mid-April, will rewrite her plan to reflect its own priorities and add in local earmarks for representatives’ districts. The Senate will follow suit, debating and passing its own budget ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, and the two branches will iron out their differences in closed-door negotiations with the goal of agreeing on a final state budget by the Jul. 1 start of the new fiscal year.For the past several years, talks have dragged past that deadline, and the state has relied on temporary budgets to keep government running.

Dave Epstein breaks it down",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/11/what-really-is-a-100-year-flood-dave-epstein-breaks-it-down,Flooding in Vermont illustrates a point about how we talk about flood risks.,"Flood warnings are still in effect in Vermont as the state has experienced torrential downpours, rising rivers and streams and emergency evacuations of people stuck in their homes. No flood-related deaths or injuries had been reported in Vermont as of Tuesday morning, according to the Associated Press. But the amount of rain falling over a short period of time is certainly “super unusual,” GBH meteorologist Dave Epstein said.“We have not seen rainfall like this since Irene,” Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said, referencing 2011’s Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011. “We’re getting just as much rain, if not more. It’s going on for days. That’s my concern. It’s not just the initial damage. It’s the wave, the second wave and the third wave.” When talking about these weather events, people may use terms like “100-year flood.” That’s a term often used by insurance companies to determine how likely that amount of flooding is to occur, Epstein said. “It just gives you a percentage of, you know, it's a 1% chance this would happen, or a 1/10 of 1% chance that this would happen,” he said. “And when you start getting these events happening more frequently that are supposed to be a 1% chance, that's when we start to evoke things like part of the changing climate — that these events get closer and closer together.”For areas along rivers and streams, flood risks continue after the rain has stopped, Epstein said. “You get the amount of water that comes down into the streams,” he said. “The small streams, they peak first. But all that small stream water has got to go into the bigger stream. So it takes a little while for those streams to start peaking.”Water levels will likely peak Tuesday or Wednesday. That means people should exercise caution around them — and stay away from flooded areas, Epstein says.Materials from the Associated Press were used in this report.",Local,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 12:01:39 EST",4eeb7e5daf33a0cb5404033b4261e9ac
1881,A church in North Thetford is getting new life as a community center for people of color,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/09/a-church-in-north-thetford-is-getting-new-life-as-a-community-center-for-people-of-color,"For decades, a congregation in North Thetford had been dwindling, so they decided to donate their building to a group that could make more use of it.","The church in North Thetford is bigger than you’d expect. There’s a large hall with a stage. Two kitchens. Two grand pianos. A pipe organ. A bell tower. And, of course, the sanctuary. It has curved wooden pews and tall, stained glass windows.Kenya Lazuli is now in charge of all this space. ""I still come in here, and I'm like, ‘What, we get to use this, whenever we want?’"" she said, as she walked through the sanctuary.Lazuli is from Corinth and works for the Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust, which took ownership of the building at the beginning of the year.She’s converting a sunny meeting room into a library, a basement room into a tool lending library. She plans to renovate the 1950s-era kitchen into a commercial-grade space. She found a popcorn machine on Craigslist for an upcoming movie night.Despite these changes, Lazuli said the church already has most everything they could need.""It has all the chairs and tables even,"" she said. ""All the bathrooms you need, it’s accessible for mobility devices. It’s set up already to be a community center.""The community center she's building is still in its infancy. It doesn’t yet have a name, and they had their first public events this month — an open house and a tool drive. The vision for this space is clear, though.""There are lots of places to gather that white-led organizations either own or run that don't feel safe or welcoming to communities of color,"" Lazuli said.""The whole point of this place is to be welcoming to communities of color, and anyone else who needs a space to gather or wants to have an event or anything.""For much of its history, the church has been a place for community gatherings. Throughout the 20th century, it hosted music and folk dancing classes, buffet suppers, Halloween parties, and hymn festivals that drew crowds of over four hundred people. Part of the appeal was where it’s located.""There was a store in town, sawmill in town, all that kind of stuff. So people drove by it, and saw it, and went to it,"" said Brigid Farrell, a retired principal from Norwich and the part-time pastor of the church.Farrell says over the years, the community changed. The mills closed. I-91 went in. A bridge that connected the town to New Hampshire came out. And younger generations stopped going to church as much.When Farrell came to the United Church of Thetford five years ago, it was no longer a bustling place. About 30 people regularly attended services, and they wanted to make a change.The church had enough money to maintain the building, but after lots of deliberation, they decided that wasn’t what they really cared about.“It was like, ‘Well, what is God calling us to do?’” said Farrell. “Once we got to that point, it really wasn't a hard decision to get rid of the building.”What they wanted was to have the building serve the community. It couldn't be converted to housing units, and they didn't want to sell it — it's worth about $150,000. So they started looking for a new owner. They reached out to arts organizations and posted messages on a town listserv. That’s how, eventually, they connected with Lazuli, who pitched using the building as a community center.“Because this space is here and not being used, it's like finding a secret treasure,” she said. “We just need to open it up.”For her, the church is the start of a much bigger project she dreamed up years ago: For every town in Vermont to designate a piece of healthy land for stewardship by people of color.Lazuli does not expect to reach this goal in her lifetime, but she says the effort feels essential.“This project is based in reparations, and beginning — just beginning, scratching the surface — of a way to repair for past harm that has been perpetrated against people of color, specifically Black and Indigenous people in this country, but also in the state,” she said. “This state is my context. So that’s why this project is happening here. But there’s a lot here.”The church in North Thetford is their first land donation. Lazuli did not originally expect the project to include a church, but she says it makes sense that their first piece of land is for everyone.As for the congregation, they’ll keep meeting in the sanctuary once a week. They’re looking forward to see the building used for more than a couple hours on Sundays.Lexi Krupp is a corps member for Report for America, a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on under-covered issues and regions.

We love to have on local experts and future leaders to celebrate their accomplishments, but what’s especially awesome about this guest is that he’s just 10 years old. Meet Tanoshi Inomata, a fourth grader who just won the Boston spelling bee and will be heading to Washington, D.C., for the national spelling bee in May. Tanoshi and his parents, Hiromi and Chikao, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to spell out his victory.Arun Rath: Tanoshi, you must have studied very hard for this. Tell us how you felt when you realized you were the winner.Tanoshi Inomata: I was surprised that I was the big champion because even though I practice a lot every day, I never thought I could. Because, first of all, there are like 4,000 words on the list. There are three levels of words on the list: level one is easy, level two is intermediate and level three is hard. I thought I couldn’t win because, on level three, there were four language origins with no rules to spell for them. Rath: Wow. For level three, do you remember what the last word that you won on was?Tanoshi: My championship word was ‘ancho.’ Rath: How do you spell that?Tanoshi: You spell it A-N-C-H-O.Rath: I have no idea what that means.Tanoshi: It means a dried mixture of poblano chili peppers. Rath: Oh, right! That’s actually something that I just learned today. So when you spelled that out, did you feel confident that you had the spelling right? What was your sense of it?Tanoshi: I was pretty confident because even though when I first practiced, I got it wrong. But then I started practicing it and I got it right.Rath: That’s brilliant. Congratulations!Tanoshi: Thank you.Rath: I didn’t realize this, but apparently, only one other person from Massachusetts has won the national spelling bee. That was over 80 years ago. How do you feel about it?Tanoshi: I feel like now I want to win the national spelling bee and show off to everyone.Rath: Are you feeling confident?Tanoshi: Yeah. Now I’m practicing two times a day. I’m practicing in the morning every weekday with Mr. Noll, the school librarian at the Winship School. And after that, after school with my mom every day, even on the weekends.Rath: Tanoshi, I’m curious, what’s a practice session like for spelling? Do you just run through lists of words?Tanoshi: Yeah. The first time I practiced with my mom, I just went through the whole list of words, and during the practice, I memorized the words that I missed.Rath: And Hiromi, you helped him out with those practice sessions later in the day?Hiromi: Yeah, I studied with him every evening. It’s not easy for a fourth-grade boy to study alone every day. I think that coming soon, he’ll be more independent and study on his own. After that, I’m sure I’ll miss studying with him.Tanoshi: Me, too!Rath: It sounds like you have a good time together. That’s awesome! And I can only imagine how proud you must be.Tanoshi: I also made an art piece. I made it by cutting and pasting the cutout from my face of the spelling bee last year. Rath: Was that to psych yourself up to win?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: That’s awesome. Well, it worked! Are you gonna do that also for D.C.? Tanoshi: Yeah. And I’m going to bring this one to D.C. also.Rath: So you’ll be heading to Washington in May. Are you going to be practicing every day between now and then?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Do you have a favorite word to spell?Tanoshi: I like to spell long words. For example, tintinnabulary. Rath: Tintinnabulary has to do with a ringing of bells?Tanoshi: Yeah.Rath: Can you spell that out for me, if you don’t mind showing off?Tanoshi: T-I-N-T-I-N-N-A-B-U-L-A-R-Y. Tintinnabulary. Rath: Brilliant. We’re so happy that you’re going to nationals and representing us. Good luck! We can’t wait to hear how it goes. Tanoshi: Oh, actually, I have one more thing.

He’s also consistently drawn headline for controversial coverage, including most recently airing tapes from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection to minimize the impact of the deadly attack.There was no immediate explanation from Fox about why Carlson was leaving. A text message to Carlson seeking comment was not immediately returned.Fox agreed last week to pay Dominion Voting Systems more than $787 million and acknowledged that some of its reporting following the 2020 election — which allowed former President Donald Trump's aides to amplify false charges of election fraud — was incorrect.But that reporting mostly concerned other shows, not Carlson’s. His name did come up during the case, primarily because of email and text messages that were revealed as part of the lawsuit.Carlson and other Fox hosts were caught in private messages doubting their own network's allegations about Dominion's role in the supposed election fraud, while also being concerned that Fox was losing audience among Trump fans at the time. In some of them, Carlson privately criticized Trump, saying he hated him passionately.A few weeks ago, Carlson devoted his entire show to an interview with Trump.“Fox News Tonight” will air in Carlson's 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, hosted by a rotating array of network personalities, for the time being.",National,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:14:38 EST",2a36a08e0d0e12f35a68285b2f07c36c
3003,"Why do we have jury duty? And how reliable are juries, really?",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/14/why-do-we-have-jury-duty-and-how-reliable-are-juries-really,GBH legal analyst Daniel Medwed on the custom's past and present.,"Ahead of his first-ever jury service, GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel asked legal analyst and Northeastern law professor Daniel Medwed about the history and the current-day practice of jury trials. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So, Daniel, in two days, I am going to be part of a jury, potentially part of a jury. I have to report for jury duty, which is something I've actually never had to do in my whole life. Daniel Medwed: Is this congratulations or condolences? Siegel: Yeah, I think more condolences in my case. I'm not actually super excited to potentially be doing jury duty. Medwed: To fulfill your civic duty, Jeremy. Siegel: Well, that's true. I guess I will be fulfilling my civic duty as an American citizen. So tell me a little bit about how that became a thing. Why is it a thing that I have to do jury duties? What's the background and the history of how this became a thing in America? Medwed: Sure. Like so many aspects of our legal system, we inherited it from Ye Olde England, and the first juries in England date back to the Middle Ages. They were called juries of recognition, and they were used in land disputes. Members of the community would come forward to recognize, from memory, who had received title to particular parcels of land from William the Conqueror. That's sort of the origin. And then by the 1400s, it evolved, and it looked a little bit like it looks today, where juries serve as finders of fact. They collect evidence, they evaluate the evidence, they weigh the credibility of witnesses, and ultimately render a verdict. So the right to a jury trial now in the United States is enshrined in our Constitution. For criminal cases, it's in the Sixth Amendment and for civil cases, where a certain amount of money is at stake, it's in the Seventh Amendment. Siegel: So I'm hearing that I have England and William the Conqueror to thank for my jury duty. Medwed: Exactly. It's a straight throughline from William the Conqueror to Jeremy Siegel. Siegel: So I know that juries aren't the case for every criminal situation. Someone can waive their right to a jury and try their luck before a judge too, right? Why would that be the case? Medwed: On the one hand, the rule of the road essentially is: If you're in a criminal case in particular, and the facts are really gory, really gruesome, a defendant might opt for a judge — it's called a bench trial — instead of a jury, based on the idea that the judge has sort of seen it all and won't be swayed by the gruesome, gory details of the case; can be more objective and dispassionate; and dispense justice in a way that might be more measured than a jury, that could be inflamed by these facts. On the other hand, that calculus differs depending on the orientation of the judge. If the judge is really punitive, really tough on crime, it might be a very different equation. And you might want to go with a jury even in a case with bad facts, because all you have to do is get one juror on your side to vote to acquit. Then you can hang the jury and get a mistrial. Siegel: Okay. So that was actually going to be the next thing that I asked about here: in order to be convicted of something, or to be acquitted, you need everybody in the jury to be on the same page?Medwed: Yes. This idea of jury unanimity in criminal cases is an interesting one. And actually the Supreme Court only resolved it definitively relatively recently, in a 2020 case called Ramos. So here's the background: In Ye Olde England, common law unanimity was the norm. You had to have unanimous juries in criminal cases. And there's an instance of one of these from like 1367. And this idea of unanimity crossed the pond, and it's a part of federal law and virtually every state law. However — and this is what sort of interesting — there is nothing in the Constitution explicitly that talked about unanimous juries in criminal cases. So Louisiana and Oregon were outliers for a long time, and they allowed people to be convicted based on votes that are 10-to-2 or 11-to-1 in favor of conviction. They both backtracked. Those states have backtracked from that in part because the Supreme Court, in that 2020 case I mentioned, finally said, hey, you know what, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under our federal Constitution implicitly carries a requirement that the jury verdict be unanimous. And therefore, we should have unanimous juries in the states as well. That hasn't stopped Florida and Governor Ron DeSantis from making waves about going back to non-unanimous juries. But I think as a matter of constitutional law, it seems like unanimous juries are here to stay in the criminal case context, at least. Siegel: So, Daniel, as you were talking about people coming to a consensus, everybody agreeing on something in order for there to be an acquittal or a conviction, it made me think about how difficult that could be for a bunch of ordinary citizens performing their civic duty, and all of the debate that happens behind closed doors between jurors. I guess I'm curious about why someone who gets caught up in the criminal justice system for one reason or another and ends up in a jury trial — why should we trust the system, at the end of the day?Medwed: I'm not so sure we do. So here's the theory is this, and then we'll talk about the practice. The theory is that you bring 12 fair and impartial citizens who represent a cross-section of the community harmed by the crime, usually within the county, the jurisdiction. If you bring them all together, they'll bring their disparate experiences to the fore, and through a full and frank conversation in the deliberation room, without outside influence, without outside supervision, they'll arrive at a just outcome. That's sort of the theory. You get 12 different people from our very diverse country, bring them all together in a room to talk about facts, and essentially a good result will occur. But the practice is much uglier than that, right? Because there are a lot of tools in the tool chest of prosecutors in particular to shape the jury in a particular way. There's a very sordid history in the United States of prosecutors using what are called peremptory challenges — you can challenge jurors for no articulable reason in criminal cases — that they were challenged based on racial bias. For instance, in a case involving a Black defendant, prosecutors would often try to craft all-white juries. There have been Supreme Court cases that have said you can't do this, but there are a lot of pernicious activities that could be done. Also, another reality of this, of course, is that 12 people in a room won't necessarily all have their voices heard and respected equally. There might be one person who dominates the conversation. It's sort of unclear what the dynamics of the deliberation room might be. So I'm actually pretty skeptical about whether juries work or not. Siegel: So real quick, Daniel, before I let you go, let's say someone, after having this conversation wasn't too excited about their jury duty coming up in a couple days. And in theory, let's say you wanted to get off of a jury. How would you go about doing that? Medwed: I can't imagine anyone would want to do that. Certainly nobody that I know and talk with at least weekly would ever want to do that. I think, Jeremy, essentially you can be excused what's called for cause, if there is some cause. If you have a conflict of interest, you have a financial stake in the case, you know one of the parties — that's sort of easy. You're going to get bounced for that. If you have a clear time commitment that makes it impossible for you to serve, a judge might actually allow you to leave as well. If you express misgivings about the case, for instance, you say, 'I could never convict somebody. I don't believe in criminal justice. I don't believe in prison.' That might also be a basis for getting a bounced. Unfortunately, Jeremy, being the co-host of Morning Edition isn't necessarily an excuse because you have Paris who can help out. You are indispensable to us, but, you know, possibly you could have one day off or one week off to do your civic duty.",Local,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 12:07:08 EST",05738717b1cf4c0b3dae13018eca89aa
6530,Your air conditioner isn't built for this heat. 5 tips to boost performance,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/20/your-air-conditioner-isnt-built-for-this-heat-5-tips-to-boost-performance,"With much of the country in the grips of a massive heat wave, many people who have air conditioners in their homes are running them overtime.","With much of the country in the grips of a massive heat wave, many people who have air conditioners in their homes are running them overtime.But these extreme temperatures present a significant challenge to AC systems, which engineers and installers say are really only designed to keep indoor temperatures about 20 degrees cooler than outside.With temperatures in many parts of the U.S. well in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days, that can pose a big problem, says Srinivas Garimella, a professor of mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech.""Most new systems in the U.S. are designed for a 95 degree day. That's a hot day, but we're having more and more of those days,"" he says.All air conditioners work the sameGarimella explains that all air conditioners work on the same basic principle — a cold, low-pressure refrigerant evaporates and absorbs heat from a room and then is compressed before condensing and releasing the heat by way of an outdoor heat exchanger. The refrigerant is then recycled in a closed loop.He compares the energy required to do this to climbing a mountain. The hotter the indoor temperature, the more effort (and energy) needed to make the climb. ""So, the higher the ambient temperature, the more the compressor has to work, the more electricity [is] needed, and the problem just keeps getting compounded,"" he says.Compressors work less efficiently at higher heat, which means they need more power to do the job. Higher humidity also places ""a humongous additional load"" on an air conditioning system, he says.Simply installing a bigger air conditioner might sound like a solution to the problem. Not so, according to Reinhard Radermacher, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland.It may be fine on the hottest days, but ""if 90% of the time [an air conditioner] is oversized,"" it's not efficient, he says.Getting the most out of your air conditionerEven so, there are some things you can do to maximize your air conditioner's effectiveness even as it struggles to keep things cool.Don't fool with the thermostat. Set it at a desired, comfortable temperature — say, 72 degrees F — and leave it alone. ""If you keep it at a low level just running all the time, it is far more efficient"" than throttling the thermostat, according to Garimella.Clean filters and the coils on the outdoor heat exchanger. Dirty filters impede air flow, and dusty coils make it harder for the heat exchanger to work efficiently, he says.Turn off heat-producing appliances. ""During the hottest part of the day, turn off anything that produces heat such as stoves, dishwashers, lights, etc.,"" according to Fritts, a heating and air conditioning company based in Georgia.Run a ceiling fan. ""The sensation of comfort comes from [both] the temperature of the air and the breeze that's blowing at you."" A ceiling fan definitely helps, Garimella says.Cool down at night and shade the windows. ""Cool down the house at night as much as possible. And then when the sun comes up in the next morning, shade all windows [and] keep the windows and doors closed as much as possible,"" according to Radermacher.Beyond those basics, there are longer-term solutions, such as better insulation and using trees to shade a house, Radermacher says.Also, variable-speed compressors, which are found only in more expensive ACs, work more efficiently than single-speed compressors, Garimella says.Systems with variable-speed compressors ""will only function at the capacity that is needed for the house. And that makes a very big difference in its efficiency and its capability to keep up with the load,"" he says.What about new air conditioning technologies? There's ""no silver bullet"" on the horizon, Radermacher says. ""There's a bunch of new technologies under way, but they all have to follow the same dynamics"" as current air conditioning systems, he says.

In his acting roles, like for HBO’s cult-hit “Search Party,” he spends a lot of time “playing gay, psycho monsters” in rude, edgy shows. But in stand-up, Early has a chance to be more warm, a style that will be on display at his live show — called “John Early Live!” — at The Wilbur on Wednesday night. “It's really, really nice in stand-up to be a little more ... generous and tap-dance-y,” he said. “I get to use some of my Southern hospitality.” He found his comedic partner in Kate Berlant in New York City as they both performed their way through the New York stand-up scene. The two met in 2012 and immediately connected. “It’s, like, the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me,” Early said. “We just totally fell in love.” Berlant and Early developed their own shared comedic language and began writing and performing comedy sketches on YouTube. “All our work just kind of comes from endless hanging out and making each other laugh,” Early said. Last year they starred in Peacock’s “Would It Kill You to Laugh?”.They each have their own careers — Berlant recently headlined her one-woman show and acted in Amazon’s “A League of Their Own” reboot — but Early said they continue to collaborate: “We always have kind of one foot in our collaboration and one foot in our solo work.”",Local,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 20:07:21 EST",fd6660ddce837a5686d8d7f59479fa4d
774,5 things to know about the latest charges against Donald Trump,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/02/5-things-to-know-about-the-latest-charges-against-donald-trump,Former President Donald Trump was indicted Tuesday on charges he participated in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results — an effort that reached a bloody crescendo as his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021.,"Former President Donald Trump was indicted Tuesday on charges he participated in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results — an effort that reached a bloody crescendo as his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021.Following an investigation by special counsel Jack Smith, a grand jury voted to charge Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, witness tampering and conspiracy against the rights of citizens, and obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding.Trump, who has been summoned to appear in court on Thursday, is still the leading candidate in the Republican primary race. If he pleads not guilty (as he has with the other indictments), we could be hearing about his trial as he makes his case for the White House.Here are five key points to help get you up to speed.1. This is the third criminal indictment for Trump, but it's more than just another legal woeThe former president now faces legal peril in three criminal cases — following March's indictment on 34 counts of falsifying business records and June's indictment on 37 counts of mishandling classified documents. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases.A prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga., is leading a separate investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to pressure state election officials there. And Trump is also fighting two civil lawsuits, including a federal jury finding that left him liable for battery and defamation.But this latest indictment stands apart from Trump's other legal challenges.The Department of Justice's investigation into Jan. 6, 2021, is among the most sprawling and complex in U.S. history — it gets at the heart of the alleged effort to overturn legitimate election results and obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.""The attack on our nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy,"" said the special counsel in a short statement before reporters. ""As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies. Lies by the defendant, targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government.""2. The latest charges represent significant legal perilThe indictment charges Trump with four serious federal criminal offenses:conspiracy to defraud the United States applies to Trump's repeated and widespread efforts to spread false claims about the November 2020 election while knowing they were not true and for allegedly attempting to illegally discount legitimate votes all with the goal of overturning the 2020 election, prosecutors claim in the indictment.Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding was brought due to the alleged organized planning of Trump and his allies to disrupt the electoral vote's certification in January 2021.obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding is tied to Trump and his co-defendants' actual efforts after the November 2020 election until Jan. 7, 2021 to block the official certification proceeding in Congress.conspiracy against rights is a Civil War-era law that applies to Trump and his co-conspirators' alleged attempts to ""oppress, threaten and intimidate"" people in their right to vote in an election.University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias described the overall case against former President Donald Trump ""damning"" and representing real ""legal jeopardy.""3. The indictment lists six anonymous co-conspiratorsFormer President Trump is the only person who is charged and he is the only defendant in this latest indictment. But the court document scatters some clues for the future in terms of who else might could potentially face charges.There are six people labeled as co-conspirators in the indictment. They are given individual numbers and potentially identifying traits but they are not identified by name in the court document.Some are attorneys who helped promote bogus election fraud claims. Co-conspirator 3 is described as an attorney who privately acknowledged the unfounded election fraud claims were ""crazy."" Another, co-conspirator 4, was a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and ""attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures.""And their descriptions line up with that of people who could be of interest to investigators, such as former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Sidney Powell, and former DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark.4. Trump is calling this indictment ""fake."" And, yes, he's still leading the pollsEven before the indictment was unsealed, Donald Trump and his allies were actively working to control the narrative, calling this a sham indictment and accusing the Biden administration of trying to interfere with the 2024 election.On Truth Social, Trump said a ""Fake Indictment"" was evidence of ""prosecutorial misconduct."" His campaign issued a formal statement (and, later, a fund-raising pitch) calling it ""election interference."" And his Republican allies in Congress — plus even some of his GOP primary foes — cast the indictment as political persecution at the hands of the Biden administration.But as NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez pointed out in an interview with All Things Considered, the attacks from Trump and his supporters are focusing on the process — not so much the substance.""They claim these are politically motivated charges. They attack the special counsel. But they don't necessarily refute specific allegations,"" Ordoñez said. ""They don't argue Trump never incited those followers who attacked the Capitol. They never say that Trump didn't seek a group of fake electors.""That's because, after two impeachments, three indictments and quite a few scandals in between, Trump has conditioned his supporters to see each allegation against him as a reason to rally around him.And it works. In March, several weeks before the first indictment, Trump had just 43% of the vote in Republican polling, according to a RealClearPolitics average. But a day after he was charged in a hush-money scheme to an adult film actress, his numbers had jumped to 50%.Two months later, he was indicted for mishandling classified documents. His polling average jumped again.As of Monday, ahead of the news of the latest indictment, Trump was still in the lead. 5. Charges for 2020 election interference are starting to pile upThe federal indictment of Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election came soon after similar election interference charges were made public against a Trump ally in Michigan.Matthew DePerno — the most recent Republican nominee for Michigan attorney general, who worked with Trump's team to try to contest his 2020 loss in the state — was arraigned Tuesday on state charges for an alleged effort to unlawfully gain access to voting machines.DePerno has been charged with undue possession of a voting machine, willfully damaging a voting machine and conspiracy, according to the special prosecutor investigating the case.Investigations into election interference are ongoing elsewhere, as well. Arizona's Democratic attorney general is investigating the 2020 fake electors there, and a Georgia prosecutor is set to soon announce her long-awaited charging decisions in an investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election there.And all of these investigations are happening separately to the Justice Department's sprawling and complex investigation into the events of Jan. 6, 2021.On that day, Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, injuring scores of law enforcement officers, forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation's political leaders and threatening the peaceful transfer of power after Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.To date, the DOJ has charged over 1,000 people in what's become the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history.That list now includes Trump.NPR's Ben Swasey and Carrie Johnson contributed reporting.

6127,Shortage of perinatal healthcare workers hurting underrepresented communities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/news/2023/07/12/shortage-of-perinatal-healthcare-workers-hurting-underrepresented-communities,The Moms Matter Act would help expand post-pregnancy care.,"It’s widely accepted that the U.S. is experiencing a mental health crisis. Often overlooked, even in the midst of the crisis, is perinatal mental health. Perinatal refers to the period of time from pregnancy up until one year after birth. Mood and anxiety disorders during that time affect at least 20% of mothers but are often left undiagnosed, forcing new parents to navigate those difficulties alone. People of color and low-income mothers are even more likely to struggle with these issues but less likely to receive the care they need.But there’s movement on the matter: A new bill called the Moms Matter Act, that aims to expand and diversify the state’s perinatal workforce, is making its way through the Massachusetts Legislature. One of its fiercest advocates is Dr. Rose Molina, an OB-GYN and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Molina joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the importance of helping new mothers, especially those from underrepresented communities, get the help they need. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: First off, as an OB-GYN, you encounter this population every day. When did you realize that the system, as it stands now, is not doing the job?Dr. Rose Molina: I encounter this issue every day that I’m in clinic. I think that mental health challenges really have a disproportionate effect—particularly on communities of color, low-income communities, and immigrant communities—and there is so much strength and resilience in people having the courage to speak out about the help that they need and the issues that they’re struggling with. Yet what’s really challenging for me as an OB-GYN is to get people the mental health support that they need in a timely manner. Waitlists are long, and there are few behavioral health clinicians that come from the same communities as patients who speak their language, who understand life in their shoes, and who can really develop that trusting kind of therapeutic relationship that we know is so important for better mental health outcomes. And so, for that reason, I wholeheartedly support the Moms Matter Act, and I hope that it is moved favorably out of the [Legislative] committee. Rath: You spoke to the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery, and something that was interesting that you talked about was how, in terms of tackling this problem, it’s not just about expanding the workforce but diversifying it. Could you expand on that?Dr. Molina: That is a really important part of this bill. And yes, we do have a workforce shortage. We certainly need to expand capacity. We need more behavioral health clinicians across the board—that’s certainly true. But, as I mentioned, particularly for the patients that I see who are often people who identify from marginalized communities, whether they’re Black or Brown or recently-arrived folks, they really want to see people who look like them, who have shared lived experience, who they can communicate with in the same language, especially as they’re sharing some of the most deeply private parts of their lives. And we know that mental health, sadly, remains very stigmatized in many communities, and so being able to talk about what people are struggling with, whether it’s depression, anxiety, suicidal thought, thoughts about harming their baby, for example—things that are very stigmatized in our society. It’s hard for people to do that when they don’t feel comfortable with the behavioral health clinicians they see. So diversifying the behavioral health clinician workforce is critical.One of my great privileges is, because I speak Spanish, most of the patients that I see speak Spanish, and I know that many of them sort of breathe a sigh of relief when they see that they can communicate directly with me without an interpreter. I can only imagine how important that sensation is when they’re talking about something as private as their mental health issues. And oftentimes related to mental health issues are other socially stigmatizing conditions, like struggling with food insecurity, struggling with finding housing, struggling with intimate partner violence, a lot of issues that are deeply private and are hard to talk about with anybody, let alone someone who might not share the same background or be able to communicate directly in the same language. Rath: Over the last few years, especially since the pandemic, we’ve talked a lot on this program about community health centers and their importance in serving communities that we’re talking about here—that are underserved. Is there a role for community health centers in getting out this perinatal care to these communities that need it?Dr. Molina: Absolutely. Really, community health centers are the backbone of the health system, and we reach the most marginalized communities in a welcome, inclusive and geographically accessible way. Health centers are super important, and I think are the backbone and need to be at the forefront of expanding mental health for pregnant individuals. Rath: So, with this moment of attention, then, how would you like to see things expand? What would be ideal for you to see in Massachusetts as we go forward?Dr. Molina: One of the things that the Moms Matter Act would do is provide more funding to community-based organizations that do a lot of the frontline support in helping birthing people welcome new babies into their lives. So I think that we need to build more connections between community-based organizations and the healthcare system, particularly in this space of mental health. So thinking about who mental health workers are—whether they are social workers, licensed mental health counselors, peer specialists—all of those folks need training and need support in their professional development to be able to continue to reach people where they need. So I think really thinking broadly about who the behavioral health workforce is—not only thinking about the people who sit within clinics but also the people who live and work in communities and how we can provide the best training for those individuals to also provide mental health support and counseling for the individuals who need it to really meet people where they’re at.Rath: And finally, you mentioned earlier some of the warning signs to look out for. For anybody who’s listening who is in this part of their life, if you’re not really up on the latest in mental health, what are warning signs to look out for, and what should people do to get help? Dr. Molina: The most common mental health conditions we see in the pregnancy period are depression and anxiety. These are both mood disorders and any sort of symptoms around feeling down, sad, depressed, lack of energy, having problems with sleep, changes in appetite, feeling more irritable; all of these things can be symptoms of depression, particularly in the postpartum period.It’s important for new moms to think about their well-being in the context of the first few weeks. That can be challenging because in the first few weeks, we know most people are not sleeping. Their eating might also be a little bit erratic as they’re taking care of a newborn, especially if they start to have thoughts of harming themselves or harming other people, including their babies. So we certainly encourage anyone who thinks those symptoms apply to them to reach out—whether it’s their midwife, OB-GYN, or whoever they see for pregnancy care—to reach out and have a conversation about those symptoms.And for anyone who is in need of urgent mental health support, they can always call 1-800-981-4357. There’s also a statewide behavioral health helpline for anyone in Massachusetts, and the number for that is 1-833-773-2445.",National,"Wed, 12 Jul 2023 18:32:38 EST",3f78c8e13eddc2850e2f60f550f3e3f3
737,Massachusetts US Attorney Rachael Rollins to resign after Justice Department ethics probe,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/05/16/massachusetts-us-attorney-rachael-rollins-to-resign-after-justice-department-ethics-probe,The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation.,"Updated May 16 at 5:29 p.m.BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins will resign following a monthslong investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general into her appearance at a political fundraiser and other potential ethics issues, her attorney said Tuesday.The Justice Department's watchdog has yet to release its report detailing the findings of its investigation, but an attorney for Rollins told The Associated Press that she will be submitting a letter of resignation to President Joe Biden by close of business Friday.The resignation of a U.S. attorney amid ethics concerns is an exceedingly rare phenomenon and is especially notable for a Justice Department that under Attorney General Merrick Garland has sought to restore a sense of normalcy and good governance following the turbulent four years of the Trump administration.Rollins' attorney said she has been “profoundly honored” to have serve as U.S. attorney and proud of her office's work but “understands that her presence has become a distraction.” Attorney Michael Bromwich — a former Justice Department inspector general — said Rollins will make herself available to answer questions “after the dust settles and she resigns.”""The work of the office and the Department of Justice is far too important to be overshadowed by anything else,” Bromwich said.The Justice Department didn't immediately comment Tuesday. The inspector general's office declined to comment.Rollins was a controversial pick to be Massachusetts’ top federal law enforcer and twice needed Vice President Kamala Harris to break a tie for her nomination to move forward in the Senate amid fierce opposition from Republicans, who painted her as a radical.Before taking the high-profile U.S. attorney job, she was the top prosecutor for Suffolk County, which includes Boston. In her role there, sparred with Boston’s largest police union and pushed ambitious criminal justice changes, most notably a policy not to prosecute certain low-level crimes such as shoplifting.She was the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts and the first Black woman to become U.S. attorney for the state.The Associated Press was the first to report in November that the inspector general’s office had opened an investigation into Rollins over her appearance last year at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser featuring first lady Jill Biden. The inspector general’s office generally investigates allegations of fraud, abuse or violation of other Justice Department policies.People familiar with the investigation told the AP at the time that the probe had expanded into other areas, including Rollins’ use of her personal cellphone to conduct Justice Department business and a trip she took to California that was paid for by an outside group.The inspector general’s office scrutiny into Rollins began after she was photographed last July arriving at a home in Andover, Massachusetts, where the DNC fundraiser with Jill Biden was held. That was according to two people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the probe.Rollins said in a July tweet that she “had approval” to meet the first lady and left the event early to speak at two community events. One person familiar with discussions before that event told the AP that Rollins was only given limited permission to meet Jill Biden outside the home.Rollins acknowledged the investigation during a December meeting with reporters, saying she doesn’t want her office to be “distracted” by the probe.“I certainly think any time there’s an investigation into anyone — and I’ve been the chief law enforcement officer in two different roles — it impacts you for sure,” Rollins said at the time.The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, another federal watchdog agency, has also been investigating whether Rollins’ attendance at the fundraiser violated the Hatch Act, a law that limits political activity by government workers. The status of that investigation is unclear.In addition to probing the fundraiser appearance, the inspector general’s office copied the phone contents of some employees in Rollins’ office as part of their probe into her possible use of her personal phone for Justice Department business, one person familiar with the matter told the AP last year.The inspector general also examined a trip Rollins took to California that was paid for by an outside group, even though Justice Department employees are not supposed to accept payments for travel. The trip was for CAA Amplify, the annual gathering of entertainment, business and political figures run by one of Hollywood’s leading talent agencies, the Creative Artists Agency.___Tucker reported from Washington.___This story has been corrected to reflect that Rollins was the first Black woman, not the first Black person, to serve as Massachusetts U.S. attorney.",Politics,"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:43:33 EST",dcabeff4b25e3e5d5f154c329ecfc13a
1222,Residents in one western Maine town look to curb Poland Spring’s appetite for water,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/14/residents-in-one-western-maine-town-look-to-curb-poland-springs-appetite-for-water,"In the small town of Denmark, near the New Hampshire border, some residents are calling for more accountability from bottled water giant Poland Spring, which extracts water from land it owns in town. Climate change is fueling concerns about protecting the local water supply.","In the small town of Denmark, near the New Hampshire border, some residents are calling for more accountability from bottled water giant Poland Spring. The company extracts water from land it owns in Denmark and then sells it to consumers. The town isn't compensated for what is withdrawn. And climate change is fueling concerns about protecting the local water supply.Last November, on the north end of Long Pond, Jim Metivier stood on his backyard dock and explained how water levels on his property have gradually receded. At first, he said the dock needed two platforms to access the pond from the shore.""And then, probably about seven years ago, I had — one, two, three, four five,"" he said pointing to dock several dock extensions. ""Plus, there's a floating one at the end that's all still in the mud.""Metivier's family has had a home here for 30 years. As ponds go, this one is small, about four miles long and 19 feet deep. In the spring, he said the water is high enough to launch his canoe from the dock. But for the past two summers and into the fall, the dock has literally been stuck in the mud.""I haven't been able to get my canoe out since July,"" Metivier said.While Poland Spring does not withdraw water from the pond, a state permit for ""large-scale pumping or extraction of groundwater, spring water and water from aquifers"" was first approved in Denmark in 2005. That year, and again in 2008, several pumping tests were conducted as surface and groundwater levels in the vicinity were monitored.The results were reviewed by a hydrogeologist at the Department of Environmental Protection. Department staff also visited the site. Ultimately, they determined that the proposed pumping operation would not ""have an undue unreasonable effect on waters of the State"" or violate any state water quality law.Records show there has been less precipitation since 2005, but those same pumping tests have been referenced each time Poland Spring's permit has been renewed.The company is allowed to withdraw up to 432,000 gallons of water per day and no more than 105.1 million gallons in any 365-day period. That's a fraction of the water that's available, according to estimates from a Portland engineering firm that helped with the application.In return for the extraction, Poland Spring pays about $34,000 in annual property taxes and has donated money to several local causes, including the Denmark Fire Department, a local culvert project and installation of lights on the town ballfield. Critics say it's hardly an equitable exchange.""When the property was purchased, I think the conception was that having Poland Springs as a neighbor was going to be a good thing,"" said Michael Fitzgibbons, who owns a vacation home with his partner on Long Pond.Poland Spring pumps water from two bore holes on its land near the pond. One is less than half a mile from Fitzgibbons' house. The water is then piped to a loading dock and trucked to bottling plants about 30 miles away. Last summer, Fitzgibbons said his backyard was more suited to a golf course than it was for launching a boat.""My water receded 15 feet,"" he said. ""We've seen several years of drought now. That's why it's absolutely critical that we pay attention to what we have. And if we're going to basically give that prized commodity away, we better do it knowingly and it should be controlled by the state.""""We're not causing it to be low. It's naturally low,"" said Mark Dubois, the natural resource manager for Poland Spring, whose parent company, Connecticut-based Blue Triton Brands, was formerly known as Nestle Waters North America.""When it rains, the pond will fill up. When it doesn't rain, the pond does get low,"" Dubois said. ""But it's not involved with our operation.""Asked whether the pond is spring fed, Dubois answered, ""Not to my knowledge.""But a 1952 study by the U.S. Geological Survey describes Long Pond as a ""small, spring-fed trout pond."" John Mullaney, a hydrologist with the USGS New England Water Science Center, said that's the same as being ""groundwater fed,"" which means it likely does have some connection to the aquifer.And, while he hasn't studied the pond, Mullaney said if that's the case, pumping operations could affect water levels, along with drought and other factors.""Changes can be rather subtle from pumping,"" he said. ""When groundwater is extracted, there's ultimately going to be less water coming out somewhere. And that's the question is always where and to what degree is that allowable?""Over the next year, Mullaney will be taking a closer look at Denmark's water supply as part of a national study on bottled water extraction in several parts of the country. The headwaters of the upper Saco River is one of the areas being reviewed. The study will include modeling for climate change factors such warmer temperatures and less snowfall.Last summer, during a widespread drought, Poland Spring proposed to double its water withdrawals from one of its bore holes in Hollis. The proposal received DEP approval. But local residents, including some whose wells had run dry, turned out in force at two public meetings to object. The company later pulled its application, telling the Maine Monitor, ""Consistent with our principle and longstanding practice of being a good neighbor, we have determined it is in the best interest of everyone not to proceed at this time.""Meanwhile, in the town of Denmark, Dubois said Poland Spring tries to be responsive to drier conditions, cutting back pumping operations when necessary. Monthly water summaries, however, show that more water was extracted in July and especially August than in the month of April during spring runoff.As part of the company's permit, surface water, springs and more than two dozen wells, including domestic ones, are regularly monitored. The data are reviewed by outside experts, including the Maine DEP and by a geologist hired by the town of Denmark. They are also shared on the town's website.""We can ensure that we have no adverse impact on area water supplies. But also, we can see that things are pretty stable here in Denmark,"" Dubois said.Some residents are skeptical. Given what's happening out West, they say there should be more regulation of the water resource. They also question the independence of the town geologist, whose costs are reimbursed by Poland Spring and whose predecessor was recently hired by an engineering firm that works closely with the company.""It's hard for us not to feel sometimes like there is a conflict of interest,"" said Laurie LaMountain, who serves on the town planning board and on a committee that is currently reviewing the town's water extraction ordinance.During an October workshop on the aquifer, LaMountain asked the town's current geologist, Brian Bachmann of the St. Germain environmental consulting firm, about his allegiance to the town of Denmark.""Our obligation is based on our code of ethics,"" Bachmann said. ""We're obligated to represent the best interest of our client.""""And the client being?"" LaMountain asked.""In this instance it would be the town,"" Bachmann said.But over the past few months, Bachmann has been absent from meetings to discuss strengthening the town's water extraction ordinance, which is now more than a decade old. Meanwhile, Dubois and other representatives for Poland Spring are regular, active participants.Denmark Town Manager Betty LeGoff said in an email that only a small amount of money was budgeted for the committee's work. So, she said it was determined that Bachmann should not attend. She also declined to allow him to be interviewed for this story, calling it an ""unnecessary expense"" for a contractor for the town.Not far from Long Pond, Chris Doyle of Denmark has a small, energy efficient house and a shallow well that was dug two years ago. It's just outside what's known as the ""zone of influence"" — the area of groundwater affected by pumping. There's just one problem. Doyle said at certain times of the year it runs dry.""This (past) spring it was full. And then we realized it wasn't coming back after about a week or so. So, we stopped using it completely,"" she said.Doyle can tell how much Poland Spring is pumping by looking at the town's website. She's convinced that her water level drops when extraction rates increase. But the company stands by its monitoring of other wells that shows groundwater levels are adequate. Bachmann said at his workshop that it would be helpful to have even more data to understand what's going on in the aquifer.""Just more information around the pond to help you guys make your decisions here is really kind of the ultimate goal,"" he said.The town's ordinance includes action and alert levels. If water drops to a certain point in Poland Spring's monitoring wells, pumping can be reduced or halted. But LaMountain said that hasn't happened in more than a decade, not since the town select board agreed to relax the threshold at the company's request.That's why she and others are hopeful that the Water Ordinance Review Committee can strengthen protections in the coming months.""We're living in a changing climate, LaMountain said. ""And it's just a lot of water to be taking from this aquifer.""A final decision on the ordinance will be left to the town select board. Dubois said he hopes what emerges will be based on science. Denmark residents, meanwhile, say they're just looking for some additional control.SeparatorThis story was originally published on Maine Public.

2888,What you need to know about blue checkmarks on Twitter,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/05/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-blue-checkmarks-on-twitter,GBH’s social media strategist breaks down the latest social media headlines.,"Roses are red, checkmarks are blue. But if you don't have one, then what do you do? There's an endless stream of conversations about blue checkmarks on Twitter. And last week, New York's public transit system, the MTA, announced it would no longer be using Twitter for service alerts and information. GBH's Social Media Strategist Zack Waldman joined GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about what’s happening in the social media zeitgeist. This transcript has been lightly edited. Paris Alston: So, Zack, where does Twitter stand on blue checkmarks right now? Zack Waldman: With the blue checkmark, that's an indication of, in theory, whether or not you have signed up for the new Twitter Blue subscription verification program. Twitter Blue costs $8 per month for individuals, and it goes for actually $1,000 per month for organizations. Checkmarks previously were always a symbol of authenticity and credibility. In the last six to 12 months, that is now certainly up for debate and in question. Alston: Because anybody can buy one. Waldman: Anybody can buy one. All it takes is this subscription fee per month to get that checkmark next to your account name on Twitter. There is certainly not as much trust in the checkmark. It has lost really significant luster. Alston: Jeremy and I were both sad to lose ours. He was probably even more sad because he loves Twitter. But I mentioned the MTA, and our very own transit authority here, the MBTA, has told GBH News that it applied for free verified organization status and an associated gray checkmark from Twitter and that it has no plans to subscribe to Twitter Blue or to pay for verification status. Now, it is important to note that both of those organizations are still on Twitter. GBH is too, and we know that our mothership, NPR has left. What goes into an organization's decision to stay or to leave or to treat Twitter differently? Waldman: We certainly gave a ton of time, effort, energy and thought into whether or not we wanted to remain active on Twitter. As a foundation, we represent so many differing production units and programs, individuals, at this company, and we made the decision that we felt like our audience was still there and we still owed it to them to be serving them with the content that we produce. And I think it's also worth noting with the MTA specifically, is that decision that they made was very much based on no longer having free access to API, which is kind of the back end of Twitter's platform. One MTA official said that it was going to cost them upwards of $50,000 per month if they wanted to continue to access the API and therefore be able to send out those emergency alerts that are so critical to informing their audience, their commuters of what's going on with the MTA in New York. So paying to be able to continue to tweet at the rate and frequency that they were doing so before, it just didn't make sense literally for them. And it may mean where they're going to have to just beef up their communication levels on other platforms, be it email, newsletter, apps, website, so on and so forth. Alston: Well, speaking of other platforms, let's talk a little bit about TikTok, because I heard that it's being used as a search engine now, for instance. Waldman: It's kind of right there in the mold of a Google in terms of how it's being used by Gen Z-ers who are looking for search results on big time topics, whether it be in the news or pop culture. They actually just created this new feature called Featured Snippets. That's when a user on the platform will type in anything, whether it be bread baking or maybe information on a new legislative bill or more information on something going on in sports with the NHL or NBA playoffs. So now TikTok will give additional written context towards the top results that populate when they put in that search. Alston: So instead of going to Google, you could just go to TikTok.Waldman: It becomes a one-stop shop and you're seeing this across the board with so many social media platforms, where they're trying to make your experience on that platform A to Z, start to finish, where you don't have to go anywhere else for whatever you're looking for. Alston: Well, lastly, Zack, since we are talking about TikTok, what's the latest on the ban that some people have been pushing for? Waldman: It's been a little quiet recently, to be honest with you. The big story was that the current Biden administration was looking to ban TikTok across the board, which is a huge undertaking, a huge endeavor. It remains to be seen what hurdles and what challenges they'll face when it comes to First Amendment rights within the courts. They have also asked, almost demanding in many ways, that ByteDance, which is the Chinese parent company of TikTok, sell to a U.S. company due to security concerns for U.S. users. And there are, I think, around 150 million users of TikTok in the country. It's no small number. So as a strategist, I would say it's very unlikely that TikTok is going to be banned anytime soon. Alston: That is GBH's social media dtrategist Zack Waldman. Thank you so much. Waldman: Thanks, Paris. Appreciate it.",Science and Technology,"Wed, 03 May 2023 11:11:04 EST",2c6ba60db23d50bc2b0d3004595d61b3
1722,Feeling thrifty: How the secondhand market is changing the fashion game,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/20/feeling-thrifty-how-the-secondhand-market-is-changing-the-fashion-game,"While thrifting has a smaller carbon footprint than fast fashion, it can still take an environmental toll.","The fashion industry has changed a lot over the decades, from the booming days of the department store to the more recent shift toward online shopping and fast fashion.But in the racks of Raspberry Beret in Cambridge, shoppers are searching through a sea of colorful sweaters for the perfect thrift. It can be a long process.""I would say like 99% of my wardrobe is probably just all secondhand,"" said Maria Mendoza, who has been working as a sales associate at Raspberry Beret for around four years. ""There's a lot more reward, I would say, behind every piece that you find. It feels more intentional and like you're giving something a chance at life, and a lot more of your character and personality shows through that.""She added that in even just the last few years, thrifting has become a popular hobby for all kinds of people.""I think it definitely used to be like an older crowd,"" Mendoza said. ""More recently, we've noticed more college students coming in. Even high school students are starting to come in. I think the internet had a lot to do with that, too.""A 2022 study by Boston Consulting Group found the secondhand clothing market is already worth 3% to 5% of the overall apparel sector, with more people citing sustainability as a factor in what they choose to buy. And while thrifting has a smaller carbon footprint than fast fashion, it can still take an environmental toll.""The longevity of our garments needs to extend,"" said Jasmina Burek, an assistant professor at UMass Lowell who studies sustainability. ""All the manufacturers need to be clear about the expiration date. If you throw this garment [away] after one year, this is the impact you're creating. ... If this polyester T-shirt goes around for five years, that's great. But in the end, if it ends up at the landfill and it's decomposed there for hundreds of years, it's not a good system that we have.""Burek said one of the larger issues at play is not just where people are shopping, but how our clothes are made.""So we have a Goodwill who accepts everything, and among this everything, there is a lot of textile. And a lot of textile is not usable anymore because people either discard the garments which are stained or garments which are already worn out or taut, have a tear,"" Burek said. ""And half of the stuff, it's garbage, and then it ends up at the landfill again.""A 2021 report from the World Economic Forum found that fashion is the planet's third-largest polluter, after food and construction industries. One option for consumers hoping to find alternatives to buying new products is a clothing swap — like the one Jessica Fixsen, a sustainability manager at the Harvard Business School, organizes every year. Employees can trade donated pieces instead of acquiring new ones.""And then the reuse center is just right next door as well,"" Fixsen said. ""It's a chance for items to find a new home right there. ... and anything that's clean and not moldy, things like that will go down to the textile recycling.""Sifting through the piles of donations at Fixsen's latest clothing swap was 22-year-old Lydia Begag, a research associate at Harvard Business School and an avid thrifter.""I think it's just being mindful of how much you spend on clothes in a given season,"" Begag said. ""I feel like there's a huge rotation of trends. I’ve become more cognizant of buying staples instead of, you know, just trying to buy the coolest thing that I see on Instagram or TikTok, and try to be more sustainable in that way.""The Harvard Business School clothing swap is just one of several in the Boston area that are reducing clothing waste. The practice is growing in popularity among organizations, niche communities and within friend groups.""I think sometimes when people think about sustainability, they equate the word with sacrifice,"" Fixsen said. ""But activities like a clothing swap are a way to remind folks that sustainability is about solutions.""As sustainability becomes an increasingly important factor in the clothing industry, the rise in thrifting and swapping is a promising start to reducing our carbon footprint. The hope for advocates moving forward is that fashion manufacturers will follow in their lead, and create more environmentally friendly options for people to purchase.",Local,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 05:00:58 EST",ab012857a0e6a9c5d353f2438e823074
3847,The COVID emergency is expiring in Massachusetts. What happens now?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/11/the-covid-emergency-is-expiring-in-massachusetts-what-happens-now,"State drops mask mandate in hospitals, rapid antigen tests not covered by insurance. But not everything’s changing.","More than three years after the COVID-19 crisis prompted federal and state officials to declare public health emergencies, those declarations came to an end today.With those expirations come notable changes to some policies and practices that have just become part of everyday life — as well as some changes that most people won't notice but that have been central to how government and health officials responded to the pandemic. Here’s what’s changing, and what isn’t, after May 11.The statewide mandate that all health professionals and visitors at hospitals, doctor's offices and other health care facilities expires. They still have the option to require masking, but many major hospital systems have announced that masks will be optional in most circumstances, including at Mass General Brigham, Tufts Medical Center, Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Lahey Health. Masks are still required at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""At Dana-Farber, we see many people who have weakened immune systems due to illness or certain types of treatment, and face masks remain an important way to help protect these patients,"" the hospital said in a statement on its website.Masks are ""optional and encouraged"" across most of UMass Memorial Health in Worcester, but the hospital specified in a note to staff last week that it is requiring masks in emergency departments, oncology clinics, and with transplant patients.The masking requirement was not a national one. Dr. Robert Goldstein, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said on Tuesday he believes Massachusetts was the last state in the country to require masking at health care facilities.""Neighboring states have similarly moved away from mandatory universal masking in health care and have pivoted to a strategy based on individual facility level criteria,"" Goldstein said at a press briefing. ""Importantly, as we make this change, we have also asked all health care facilities to develop a proactive plan that uses real-time data to identify when and where COVID-19 prevention strategies should be used, including a return to masking if necessary.""The state's decision to change the hospital masking policy has drawn protest from some activists, who say it puts immunocompromised people and many with disabilities in danger. “Universal masking has been a life saver for many people with disabilities,"" said Colin Killick, executive director of the Disability Policy Consortium in a statement. ""The fact that hospital mask mandates are being lifted this week ... will once again needlessly endanger the lives of those who are at greater risk because of their disabilities.""For many, rapid antigen tests became a trusted way to return to something closer to a normal life while making sure not to spread COVID-19 to family and friends. That became especially true since early 2022, when the tests became available from pharmacies with full coverage from insurance companies. As the emergency declaration ends, that mandated insurance coverage becomes a thing of the past.""People are going to be less likely to think about sniffles or coughs in light of COVID-19, and there will be a further barrier to getting tested because of the cost that these tests might involve,"" said Dr. Cassandra Pierre, associate hospital epidemiologist and medical director for public health programs at Boston Medical Center. ""And it's not a negligible cost.""Rapid antigen tests typically sell for roughly $10 each. Pierre noted the expense of the tests would be hardest for low-income communities who have already been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.Goldstein, the state public health commissioner, said this week that the state has a ""cache"" of rapid tests and can make them available where needed.""We have over 2.5 million rapid tests available if someone were to need those — any health care facility or community,"" Goldstein said. ""We're going to have to think through how do we make sure that all of the community organizations have the tests that they need, that they had access to previously. They're not going to have the same stream that they had before and the same reimbursement that they had before. But we're working to make sure that everyone who needs a test or wants a test can have a test.""States are no longer required to share the same level of data related to COVID-19 cases that they've had to for the last three years, including daily reporting of new cases. Data on new cases had already become increasingly inaccurate as more people self-diagnosed using home tests, and wastewater data has become a more reliable metric for community exposure, Goldstein said. But there are also changes in other reporting requirements.""We'll see changes in the hospitalization reporting,"" Goldstein said. ""We were previously getting reporting on a daily basis and we'll shift to a weekly basis, which does make sense at this moment in this pandemic and will allow us to continue to stay up to date on what's happening in the hospitals.""The state will also report new vaccinations on a weekly basis, rather than a daily one, he said. ""We're working through all of those changes to make sure that the information that's necessary for communities and for health care settings will continue to be available, accessible, understandable, so that they can make local decisions about what they need to do to protect themselves against COVID,"" Goldstein said.But some public health experts say they're concerned the changing data requirements will make it harder to track the virus's spread.""I do think that we will not have as much information to go on, when and if we decide it's time to pull back or reinstitute some of our former recommendations, for the good of both infection prevention in the hospital and infection prevention in the community,"" Pierre said.The reduced reporting requirements will make studies of vaccine effectiveness more difficult, said Andrew Lover, assistant professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst. That's because negative COVID tests will no longer have to be reported.""Those studies have been reasonably easy to run through testing sites, but they're going to be a lot more complicated now that the testing will be set up quite differently,” Lover said. For years now, the federal government has bought and distributed doses COVID-19 vaccines and theraputics. The system is transition to a more commercial model, but that process hasn't started quite yet.""The timeline for commercialization is more towards the fall and winter of this coming year,"" Goldstein said Tuesday. ""And so on May 11th, folks can still go and get a vaccine wherever they were getting a vaccine before. And the cost of that vaccine will still fall to the federal government. So nobody should be limited in their access to vaccines.""But some local boards of health say they're worried about their future ability to continue offering vaccination clinics.""If we had a clinic tomorrow and I had 500 people show up, I could ask the state for vaccine and receive it,"" said Tim McDonald, director of Health and Human Services for the town of Needham. That's because the state has a stockpile of vaccines, McDonald said.""That is there until it's gone,"" he said. ""And the state projects [its supply] will last into September, potentially October. The state isn't getting any more for free from CDC. Once the state stops getting more for free from CDC, it doesn't give local [boards of health] any more for free. And locals have to then enter the commercial marketplace just like a CVS or a Walgreens, and try to purchase it at quite an expensive cost.""The cost of those vaccines would be reimbursed by insurance coverage, but getting the doses would require a significant up-front expense for local boards of health.""They'll get the money back. It'll come back, you know, nine to 12 months later, in insurance reimbursements,"" McDonald said, adding many cities and towns don't have the funds to foot that bill up front.During the pandemic, the state allowed hospitals to use non-clinical spaces for uses like testing, vaccination and other services related to the pandemic. Boston Medical Center, for example, set up a testing facility in a former restaurant.""And it was a godsend to be able to do that, because otherwise it would have been open-air tents, which would not have worked in the fall and winter,"" said Dr. Pierre.It was set to revert on May 11, but the state chose to extend the exemption.During the pandemic, the federal government loosened restrictions around the prescription of buprenorphine — commonly known by its commercial name, Suboxone — which is used to treat opioid use disorder and help prevent overdoses. Previously, doctors were required to see patients in-person before prescribing the drug, but a pandemic rule change allowed them to prescribe it following a telehealth visit. That option was set to expire with the emergency declaration, but the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has put that change on hold.""They got more than 30,000 comments in response to that proposed rule change,"" said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center. ""So they're processing all of that, and they said we're going to take a pause and we're going to get back to you once we've thought this all through.""Komaromy said she regularly prescribes the drug, and the ability to do so by telehealth appointments is especially helpful for patients admitted to treatment centers that they can't easily leave.""This is a life-saving drug,"" Komaromy said. ""There's tons of evidence that this medication decreases risk of HIV, of hepatitis, of going to jail, helps people get back to work, helps prolong life, helps prevent overdoses. So super critical medication for people to have access to when they have opioid use disorder. So,we want to take away barriers to this medication and help people to have access to treatment.""",Local,"Thu, 11 May 2023 13:07:55 EST",8292055656fe1561bcc0e5a53906ffcd
4610,"As Massachusetts weighs physician-assisted death, a California reporter explains her state's rollout",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/15/as-massachusetts-weighs-physician-assisted-death-a-california-reporter-explains-her-states-rollout,California legalized medically assisted suicide in 2016 under then-Gov. Jerry Brown.,"Earlier this month, new polling showed that nearly three out of four voters in Massachusetts support a bill that would allow terminally ill adults the option to be given life-ending medication. Should legislation advance in the State House, Massachusetts would join the 10 states and Washington, D.C. that have already legalized physician-assisted death.One of those states is California, where the legislation passed and was signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016. Health reporter April Dembosky of California’s KQED station covering the Bay Area joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the rollout of physician-assisted death in California. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: There are a few different terms and euphemisms for the process: medical aid in dying, physician-assisted suicide, the right to die, to name a few. You’ve written about these euphemisms. What is the evolution of it? Is it all about just moving away from the term ""suicide""?April Dembosky: It’s interesting. I covered the debates around this bill throughout the time that it was moving through the Legislature. And throughout that time, I was actually lobbied by people on both sides about what terms to use. At the time, in California, we started out referring to the practice as assisted suicide because that was the term that people knew and because this was the style that was recommended by the Associated Press. But during that time, proponents really argued that that term was not accurate. They said, you know, suicide refers to someone who wants to die, whereas people who were seeking this kind of care wanted to live but were already dying, and the process was about hastening their death, not causing it. At the same time, the terms that proponents were using tended to be jargony or, as you said, euphemistic. They were difficult to grasp. You know, especially back then — aid in dying, death with dignity — people didn't really understand exactly what those terms meant. What we ended up doing was we ended up trying to avoid using either side's preferred language. We would just try to put the law in context and say, this is a law that allows terminally ill people to take lethal medication to hasten their death. I will say once the bill became law here, we did become a little bit more sympathetic to the proponents and started to veer away from using terms like assisted suicide, although I do believe that is still the official term used by the AP.Rath: Tell us about how the process has worked as it’s been rolled out over the last several years.Dembosky: The first thing to say is that since this became law, not a lot of people have actually taken advantage of it. In the last three years, our state data shows that less than 500 people a year will take these lethal medications to end their lives.Rath: For a state the size of California, that’s not a lot of people.Dembosky: It is .001% of the number of people who die in California every year. So it’s a very, very small number. Part of this is because a lot of people aren’t interested, or a lot of people don’t know about it. But especially in the earlier years, there was also an issue with being able to find a doctor who was willing and trained to provide this kind of service. So even people who didn't know about it and wanted to take advantage of it couldn't necessarily find someone to help them. Our law in California was quite clear that this is optional, that no doctor has to do it if they have objections to it. So, for example, all of the Catholic systems in our state actually forbid their doctors from participating. But other large health care systems, like Kaiser Permanente and Sutter, started programs where they started to reach out to physicians to find out who was interested. And then they started to do training and education so that they would understand all the protocols and science around the medication. We also had a nonprofit group that began a centralized referral system. It's called the American Clinicians Academy on Medical Aid in Dying. Patients can go to this website, fill out an intake form, and if they qualify, they'll be matched with a doctor near them who's willing to provide the service.Rath: So overall, on the patient’s side, for people who do want to pursue that option, how difficult is it to go through legally?Dembosky: It's interesting that you phrase it as difficult, because I think some of the early adopters, if you will, who did try to take advantage of this law made complaints that it was too difficult. I think if you were to ask some of the opponents of the bill, that was, by design, there was really fierce debate around this bill. Most of the opposition came from disability rights advocates who feared that there would be coercion, that people who were living with disabilities might be pressured by their family members or even by doctors to give up on life-saving care that was perhaps expensive and choose this option to end their lives. The people who were pushing the bill really listened to these concerns and worked a lot of safeguards into the bill. For example, two doctors have to verify that the person has a terminal illness and has six months or less to live. The patient has to request the medication three times before they can get it, and one of those times has to be in writing. And then there's also a waiting period of 15 days between the first two requests. One of the early studies that was done around the practice actually found that close to a quarter of the people who wanted this medication were actually dying during that 15-day waiting period and were unable to have the deaths that they had hoped for. Rath: Obviously, this being applied disproportionately to the disabled or to the elderly or to people who might be poorer or other kinds of disadvantaged communities is kind of a nightmare scenario that people who are opposed to these laws tended to lay out. How much are those other fears coming into play?Dembosky: The data we have from California shows that these fears or assertions are not actually being borne out. I would say from a demographic perspective, physician-assisted death or aid in dying has been largely a white enterprise. To date, 87% of people who have taken these medications in California are white. Overwhelmingly, they are highly educated, having at least some college education, if not a college or a graduate degree. The vast majority of people who take the medication take it for a terminal illness like cancer, so 70% of people who have taken it have some kind of cancer. After that, it's 11% that have a neurological disease like ALS or Parkinson's. And then after that, it's heart disease or respiratory disease. We're also not seeing some of the fears around people with disabilities. So we don't know what percentage of people who have taken the drug have a non-terminal disability. But what we do know is that if they took the drug, it's most likely because they also had a terminal illness, most likely cancer. Rath: I’m wondering if, on the other side, if those disparities reflect, say, people of color or people who are economically disadvantaged are not getting as much access to these services or maybe other aspects about why they’re not opting in?Dembosky: The proponents of this practice would certainly argue that that is the case. They would say there hasn’t been enough outreach to let people know that this is available.",National,"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:58:17 EST",637206047a0a2221887bd661c2bd424b

William Prescott.The original monument was a wooden structure dedicated to Warren, whose leadership and death in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, made him an early martyr for the American Revolution. Warren was a doctor — and a slaveowner — who refused a position of command and instead marched as a regular soldier and died on the battlefield.The battle was a defeat for Patriot forces who ultimately retreated. But the British suffered devastating losses, and news of the fight ignited the colonies. An 1851 history text describes the Battle of Bunker Hill as “kindling that blaze of glory which finally triumphed in the deliverance of an oppressed people, and in the foundation of a great empire.”A story less told — though now part of exhibit in the museum across the street — is that the 1,500 or so Patriot soldiers in the battle included about 150 people of color, including at least two dozen who were servants or slaves, or who were formerly enslaved.And — like much of the history of enslavement linked to sites on the Freedom Trail — this information isn’t new. Nearly 20 years ago, the National Park Service produced a report that documented the service history of soldiers of color who fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Those include Peter Salem, an enslaved man credited with killing a top British officer, Maj. John Pitcairn, and Cuff Whittemore, a legally free man who historians say was injured in the battle but bravely ""fought to the last."" One formerly enslaved soldier, Salem Poor, who had purchased his freedom six years earlier, performed with such bravery in the battle that 14 officers signed a petition to the General Court honoring him. No other soldier present at the Battle of Bunker Hill was singled out for commendation.Poor died in 1802. He was buried, anonymously, in Copp's Hill Burying Ground.SeparatorThis story is part of the project Enslavement History of the Freedom Trail, a collaborative effort between GBH News and Boston University students to detail the mostly hidden history behind some of Boston's most well-known sites.",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 05:00:58 EST",a059c279f97bc4d38496c8bc4c35d87b
1403,'The Super Bowl of internet law': Local expert weighs in on Supreme Court Section 230 cases,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/23/the-super-bowl-of-internet-law-local-expert-weighs-in-on-supreme-court-section-230-cases,"“We could end up with an internet that is very, very different than what we’ve seen.”","Big tech was on Capitol Hill this week defending itself from allegations that the platforms helped aid and abet terrorism through their algorithms. Google and Twitter are shielding themselves behind the statute known as Section 230, or the Communications Decency Act of 1996. This landmark law, which came to be while the internet was still in its infancy, basically lets the social media platforms off the hook for what its users say online. Section 230 critics argue it allows tech companies to propagate harmful content that could incite violence, as it did for Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed by ISIS terrorists in 2015. Section 230 supporters say repealing it would threaten free speech as we know it, while hampering the creativity and innovation that comes from diverse online communities and platforms. It's hard to believe that the fate of a 26-word statute could upend the future of the Internet. UMass Amherst Professor of Public Policy Communication and Information Ethan Zuckerman sat down with All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss what he calls the ""Super Bowl of internet law."" The following is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: Section 230 almost has as much history as the Super Bowl. So frame this for us, because people talk about this law or this statute going back to 1996 as being responsible for the internet as we know it. Is that an overstatement? Ethan Zuckerman: It's not an overstatement. Let me set this up for you. As the early internet is coming into focus, there's a really interesting question about how we should think about internet service providers — big internet companies that are hosting lots and lots of users. One of those companies, CompuServe, get sued in 1991, and someone essentially says, ""Hey, someone posted a comment on CompuServe. It was defamatory. CompuServe, you're responsible for it."" And in that case, Cubby v. CompuServe, the court found that no, CompuServe is not the publisher. CompuServe is more like a digital library. Then in 1995, someone took Prodigy, which was another one of these online platforms, to court. Same basic circumstance: someone is defaming someone on the message boards. Because you are doing moderation on these message boards because you're taking down some content, you are, therefore, a publisher. And in that case, the New York Court does find that Prodigy is more analogous to a book publisher than to a library or a bookstore. And so this comes in front of Congress in 1996. The idea behind it, the reason this is part of something called the Communications Decency Act, is that the web is very, very new in 1996. People are really concerned about the spread of adult content. What Congress wants to do is allow companies to take down content that violates their terms of service. So they end up saying, ""If you are taking these steps to edit your communities — if you are cleaning them up, if you are moderating them — you are not going to be liable for the users' speech."" That happens in '96. Most of the Communications Decency Act gets overturned. So this is the one sort of surviving little bit of a piece of legislation that was found unconstitutional. It survives because so much of the contemporary Internet is really hard to imagine happening without this shield. Rath: Tell us about how yesterday's case went. It seemed like the justices were pretty skeptical of the takes to take away the shield of Section 230.Zuckerman: Well, following the Super Bowl metaphor, we've really had sort of two halves. We had an argument in a case called Gonzalez v. Google, and then yesterday, we had an argument in Twitter v. Taamneh. In both cases, what's happening is the petitioner is arguing that a big internet platform — YouTube, in one case, and Twitter, in the other — failed to take steps to prevent ISIS from putting content online. In that Gonzalez v. Google case, the argument is that YouTube's algorithms end up recommending ISIS content, and therefore YouTube is at least partially liable for an ISIS attack that killed Nohemi Gonzalez. In Twitter v. Taamneh, it's a slightly less direct case. It's really more making the argument that Twitter might bear liability for ISIS' actions in the same way that a bank that's engaged with terrorist financing might be liable. Somehow, Twitter is making it possible for ISIS to recruit on its platform, and by contributing to ISIS being able to reach a larger audience, Twitter might share the responsibility for an attack — in that case, in Istanbul, Turkey, that killed the client. So in both cases, what people are trying to do is say, ""These platforms have to take some liability, not just for the content that's on the platforms, but in particular for recommending that content"" — for putting it in front of users and making what seems like it might be an editorial choice. But, as has become very, very clear, almost every web platform that hosts lots of user content uses some sort of algorithms to deal with the enormous explosion of content, the huge amount of information that's out there. If we argue that YouTube is liable for recommending some of these videos, where does that liability stop? Does a search engine become liable for giving you information that you have searched for? If we find that in that case, the internet as we know it is going to change quite radically. Rath: Sitting judges on the Supreme Court may not be the most tech-savvy. Are they the appropriate group of people to weigh in on a statue like this that's as complicated as you've laid out? Zuckerman: Well, Elena Kagan actually made that point — that the nine justices were not, in fact, the most tech-savvy group and got a good laugh from all involved. I have to say, from what I've heard in the hearings and what I've read from fellow commentators in the space, I think the petitioners came up as weaker than expected, and I think the Supreme Court came up as more nuanced than I expected. The questions that got asked were actually pretty good. It's one of those moments where you could hear the Supreme Court ask the lawyers presenting in front of them for a possible solution. What happens when a technology platform is promoting COVID-19 misinformation? What happens, as is in these cases, when tech platforms are promoting terrorist information? Are these platforms, in fact, fair in terms of ideological bias on these things? So we see this happening at the Supreme Court rather than happening at the legislative level, which is perhaps where it'd be more appropriate for it to be happening. Rath: If the court, say, rules against the tech companies here and say, ""You know what, you're not protected by this,"" does that mean that the big companies have to staff up with a lot more content moderators and have a lot more legal bills, and the smaller sites maybe go out of business?Zuckerman: Well, Google's counsel made basically that argument. Google basically said, ""Look, without Section 230, the internet is going to go in two different directions. You're going to have some platforms that are essentially a toxic swamp. They're going to be wholly unmoderated because the danger of moderation will end up being so high. If being involved with moderating and recommending means that you're a publisher, some people will run platforms that have absolutely no moderation. There will also be a set of platforms that are likely to be very heavily edited. Things will be as carefully chosen as stories in a magazine or a newspaper because there will be the possibility of lawsuits associated with it."" Brett Kavanaugh, I believe, suggested that this is going to be a lawsuit machine, but we could end up with an internet that is very, very different than what we've seen.",National,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 18:01:09 EST",d7255e0b61e2ca960d2d9dd8f3955734
5131,"Potential 2024 ballot questions: rent control, voting rights, psychedelics and more",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/08/03/potential-2024-ballot-questions-rent-control-voting-rights-psychedelics-and-more,Attorney General Andrea Campbell will announce next month which ones can move forward.,"The 2024 state election is still more than a year away, but the portion of the ballot that asks voters to weigh in on various policy proposals is starting to come into focus. Eighteen groups filed 38 proposed laws and four proposed amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution by a Wednesday deadline, the first step in a long path toward putting their ideas before voters as ballot questions. Broadly, the topics range from education policy to legislative transparency to voting rights. Some specific proposals seek to formally establish the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples Day in Massachusetts, raise the minimum wage for tipped workers, suspend the state’s gas tax if fuel prices cross a certain threshold, and decriminalize natural psychedelic substances like psilocybin mushrooms. Attorney General Andrea Campbell plans to announce on Sept. 6 which proposals filed with her office are constitutionally valid. The backers of those petitions, if they’re seeking to place a potential law on the 2024 ballot, will then need to gather and file the signatures of more than 75,000 registered voters by Dec. 6. The groups proposing constitutional amendments, which need to be twice-approved by the Legislature, are working toward the 2026 ballot. Here’s a look at some of the issues that could wind up on the 2024 ballot. Massachusetts voters passed a statewide ban on rent control in 1994. As cities like Boston pursue a winding path through the Legislature to try to impose local rent-stabilization policies, one state lawmaker is hoping to take the concept to voters once again. Cambridge Democrat Rep. Mike Connolly, who said he was acting in his “personal capacity as a renter,” filed a petition that would lift the ban and revive rent control as an option for cities and towns that choose to adopt it.An industry-backed coalition that wants to ensure drivers for platforms like Uber and Lyft retain their status as independent contractors is back for round two. But this time, organized labor is in the mix with its own question. The Supreme Judicial Court struck from last year’s ballot a question that would have written into law that the drivers are contractors rather than employees, leaving unsettled a fight that’s been simmering for years on Beacon Hill about the drivers’ status, rights and benefits. This year, the coalition filed nine versions of their question, trying to find the right language to fend off a potential court challenge. Backers of the question say contractor status allows for the independence that many drivers prize, while opponents say it denies them the rights and benefits guaranteed to employees.The labor union 32BJ SEIU, meanwhile, put forward its own question that would allow the drivers to unionize, with the goal of being able to negotiate their working conditions.Another union with its sights on the 2024 ballot is the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which for years has been calling for changes to the state’s MCAS assessments. The MTA backs a question that would end the use of MCAS tests as a high school graduation requirement, and its board plans to decide at a Sunday meeting whether to launch a full union campaign in support of the initiative. A similar question was also filed by a Lexington mom. Critics of the MCAS say using the exam as a graduation requirement can be punitive, especially to students with special needs or those from marginalized groups. Supporters say it’s a crucial tool for ensuring uniform standards across districts and tracking whether students are getting the instruction they need. Petitioners filed eight different versions of a question that would require voters to show an ID at the polls. A similar proposal, which was backed by the Massachusetts Republican Party, failed to make last year’s ballot after its supporters didn’t gather enough signatures. Other election-related questions would expand voter registration options and create a non-partisan election system where the top five candidates of any party advance after a preliminary contest for state-level and Congressional elections. One of the constitutional amendments eyed for 2026 would restore voting rights to Massachusetts citizens incarcerated for felony offenses. That would effectively reverse an amendment voters approved in 2000 that prohibited people from voting while in prison serving felony sentences. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio and top lawmakers have for months been in a standoff over whether DiZoglio has the authority to audit the Legislature. House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka say it would violate the state Constitution, while DiZoglio maintains that an audit would boost transparency in a body she’s described as a “closed-door operation.”DiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat, last week requested AG Campbell’s support in bringing the matter to court, and now she’s backing that up with a ballot campaign as well. DiZoglio is one of the petitioners on an initiative that would expressly authorize her office to audit the Legislature.",Politics,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:27:31 EST",74b296a9bbcaef40521397d34133a464

Sure, you’ve banned books by Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation. The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.” As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — because today is rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl, both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans. My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstar LeBron James toppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history.",Commentary,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 05:00:53 EST",56c163d7bc89c1725e2c1a6f2fa9dcfd

Public water utilities in Massachusetts are required to regulate six PFAS chemicals at 20 parts per trillion. The new federal regulations would limit six PFAS chemicals — including two that are different from what state regulations cover — to four parts per trillion.""Lowering that to four is definitely going to trigger violations for a lot more communities across the entire country,"" said Kirsten King, executive director of the New England Water Works Association. ""And that's simply because PFAS is absolutely everywhere."" Installing systems to filter out those chemicals is no small feat, said Don Bunker, the New England Water Works Association's deputy director.""We're talking probably in the millions of dollars [per facility], depending on the size and depending on what already exists,"" Bunker said. ""Depending on the size of the utility, we can be talking filters that are 10 to 12 feet diameter, 20 feet tall, and you may need six of them. It's a building. It's not just a couple of things under your sink. And so that's going to take time to design, permit install, get up and running.""And with water systems around the country needing to upgrade or install filtration systems at the same time, there are likely to be significant supply chain challenges on the necessary equipment, Bunker said.""There's only so many manufacturers and places where this can come from,"" Bunker said. ""So how are all of these utilities now all at once going to be able to meet the timeline and put these [filtration systems] in?"" According to the Massachusetts Water Works Association, 170 public water systems in the state are currently working to address PFAS contamination, and more would likely need to install expensive filtration systems or find new water sources given the proposed federal standards.""We're suspecting that there'll be a good number of water systems who will now have to move forward with treatment or finding an alternative source, given that the standard is going to be set at four parts per trillion,"" said Jennifer Pederson, executive director of the Massachusetts Water Works Association.Most PFAS treatment is being funded through loans managed by the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust, Pederson explained.""But it is a loan and it's not a grant. It needs to be paid back by the ratepayers in the communities,"" Pederson said. ""Certainly we want to provide high quality water, but the expense is enormous. And and so we are mindful that it will fall to our ratepayers to fund that expense.""Last month, the Biden administration announced $38 million from the federal infrastructure law would go to Massachusetts for addressing PFAS contamination. But experts said that funding won't cover what needs to be done.""It doesn't even remotely come close to touching the amount of money that's going to be needed in order to install the treatment systems,"" King said.In some cases, including near military bases that were responsible for contaminating groundwater, remediation has been paid for by those responsible for releasing PFAS. But Pederson said the source of the contamination often remains unknown.""I think the problem we are seeing in Massachusetts is that we have so many detections right now,"" she explained. ""You know, we are at 170 public water systems — DEP hasn't had the capacity on the waste site cleanup side to follow up with all of those detections and try to find a responsible party.""Last May, in an effort to secure cleanup money, Massachusetts joined a multistate lawsuit against more than a dozen manufacturers of firefighting foams that contain PFAS.For some local water systems, a more affordable option might be finding alternative, uncontaminated water sources. So far, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority system, which serves 61 communities in the Boston metro area, has not detected PFAS, said Fred Laskey, MWRA's executive director. ""Or if we do, it's very small trace amounts that are barely measurable,"" Laskey said, adding that the MWRA has the capacity to add more communities to its system.""We're just watching closely to see how that develops with communities who do have PFAS who are close enough to us to to make a connection,"" Laskey said. ""Some people want to maintain their independence. We understand that. Others want to take a look at the MWRA and our water and the value of it. It's great water.""

7230,‘A chaotic mess at any turn’: Why Worcester City Council meetings can be a spectacle,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/15/a-chaotic-mess-at-any-turn-why-worcester-city-council-meetings-can-be-a-spectacle,Councilors meet every Tuesday. You never know what will happen.,"Idella Hazard can tick through one memory after another of bizarre moments from weekly Worcester City Council meetings. There have been times when speakers have cursed out counselors. And when the mayor has threatened to have people arrested for speaking too long during the public comment period. Last year, councilors debated international nuclear weapon disarmament. “I don’t know what the heck that has to do with the city of Worcester,” said Hazard, who’s been regularly watching the city council meetings for more than four decades. “I’ll be honest, I’ve sat there a couple times laughing out loud and getting dirty looks from a couple of the councilors and the mayor.” She’s far from alone. Local journalist Bill Shaner calls himself the “Jane Goodall of the Worcester City Council” and organizes weekly council watch parties.“I kind of like to default to watching it like a reality show,” Shaner said. “Just sort of see the humor in all of it.” Traditionally, council meetings like Worcester’s are a way elected officials in Massachusetts cities and towns oversee local operations and pass new policies and laws. But Worcester’s meetings are unique because they can be an unpredictable spectacle. They often run for at least three hours and can involve long discussions about trash and rats, passive-aggressive barbs between councilors, and votes on issues as minute as whether to place a single accessible parking spot in front of an apartment complex.“It could become a mess, a chaotic mess at any turn,” Councilor Thu Nguyen said. “There’s meetings where I’m like, ‘Oh this is going to be a 45-minute meeting.’ And the next thing you know, it’s three hours.”The cast and characters of the “reality show” include all 10 councilors, the mayor, city manager and city clerk, along with guest stars from the public. Although the drama during the meetings sometimes involves more significant issues like housing or policing, it more often arises from drawn-out discussions of minute problems that impact small groups of people. Take the story of the Indian Lake watercraft ban. People with homes along the lake asked councilors to ban motorized boats and personal vessels, like Jet Skis, in 2021. And they did. When the ban came back up for renewal a year later, a city council subcommittee recommended councilors continue it. Instead, councilors delayed a vote on the issue using a procedural maneuver known as a hold. They then engaged in an hours-long debate over two meetings on the ban, which eventually passed 9-1. “People hold a lot of things and it just prolongs things,” Councilor Sean Rose said. “That can be frustrating.”Another common practice that takes up time? Shaner and Hazard said councilors constantly repeat each other during debates — even if they agree on the issue.“There's no way of knowing which item is going to be one of the items where everyone has to speak on it,” Shaner said. “There's a tendency for Worcester City Council to see themselves as deserving of the limelight that the position affords — that the point of the job is speech time.” While the time spent on random, less significant issues can be a form of theater for residents watching, Nguyen and Rose said the meetings take a toll. Nguyen, a first-term councilor in their second year, has suffered from anxiety as a result of the unpredictability of meetings each week. The councilor usually tries to manage through the meetings with coffee, chocolate or gummy bears. “It gets tiring,” Nguyen said. “It’s really hard to focus. Sometimes I just start doodling.” Rose added when he first joined City Council about six years ago, he was so excited for the meetings that he ran into City Hall for them. Now, it’s more like a slow “Army crawl,” he said.Worcester councilors and officials attribute the length and unpredictability of the meetings in part to Worcester’s form of government. Unlike Boston and dozens of other cities where a mayor is in charge of all operations, a city manager is the chief executive in Worcester. City councilors and the mayor hire and oversee the manager.However, Rose said because council positions are part-time and councilors share just one full-time staff member, they have little time and assistance to supervise the city manager on a day-to-day basis. As a result, city council meetings are a main opportunity to seek information from the manager on mundane issues like pothole repairs and snowplowing. For comparison, city councilors in Cambridge and Springfield are also part-time positions, but both councils have more people working for them. The staff help the councils keep in regular touch with city leaders about municipal operations, letting councilors focus more on bigger policy issues during meetings. “[Meetings are] always extremely efficient,” Springfield City Clerk Gladys Oyola-Lopez said. “There’s always real work that’s getting done. … For [Worcester’s] council to not have a dedicated staff, that would be a huge problem.” Worcester City Clerk Niko Vangjeli has looked into staffing in other municipalities at the City Council's request as a step toward possibly hiring additional staff. However, the council has yet to take action on the information. Some Worcester city officials and watchdogs say there are benefits to councilors meeting so often and discussing such a wide range of issues. David Rushford, who spent 37 years as Worcester’s city clerk before retiring, said the meetings help make the city’s government process more transparent. Still, he added that modifications other than hiring more staff may be necessary to help City Council meetings run smoother. He suggested councilors go along with subcommittee votes more regularly. Each committee consists of a different group of councilors. Too often, Rushford said, the council holds long debates on issues that a committee has already discussed and made a recommendation on — like the Indian Lake watercraft band. “The rules are [that subcommittee] is where the work is done,” Rushford said. “If the councilors are routinely taking up items in council that were already handled in committee, then they're making life miserable for themselves.” Idella Hazard, the longtime City Council watchdog, would appreciate more efficient council meetings. She values City Council as an essential party of democracy, and she walks 15 minutes from home to City Hall every Tuesday to send a message to councilors that the public is watching them. But sometimes she fantasizes about doing something else on a Tuesday night. “I would go to the library and do some arts and crafts there,” she said, adding that attending meetings every week is “exhausting.”",Local,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 05:00:45 EST",bd7674928931748bfe122bfa91a24829
1618,What lessons have we learned from the COVID pandemic?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/26/what-lessons-have-we-learned-from-the-covid-pandemic,"The United States is moving on from COVID-19. Well, at least the federal government is.","The United States is moving on from COVID-19. Well, at least the federal government is. President Joe Biden signed a resolution to end the national emergency to respond to the pandemic. In May, the White House also plans to disband its COVID response team. More than three years into this pandemic, the federal government never created an official commission to investigate, something regularly done after national emergencies. Efforts to create it stalled in Congress.The nonpartisan Covid Crisis Group took matters into its own hands. On Tuesday, it released its investigative report, titled ""Lessons from the Covid War: An Investigative Report.""NPR's Mary Louise Kelly spoke to the head of the group, Philip Zelikow, about the report's findings. He is also the former executive director of the 9-11 Commission.This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Interview highlightsOn the findings from the ""Lessons from the Covid War"" reportThe key to this crisis and the key to what went wrong was we weren't really ready to meet an emergency. We had the best science. We were willing to spend the most money. That wasn't the problem. The problem was in knowing what to do and being ready to do it. I think the reason we wrote the report was so that people would actually have a better idea of what you really need to do in an emergency like this. And I think anyone reading this report will just say to themselves, ""Oh, I think I understand this now. I think I understand why things went so wrong in all these different ways."" And also, they'll notice a lot of things that went right, a lot of improvisations that began to work. And then we want to hold those lessons and not lose them.On the central questions they were trying to answer Instead of going back afterwards and trying to do a hindsight analysis of the statistics and correlations, we instead went into this asking ourselves, ""Why did people make the choices they made? What information was available to them when they made these choices? What tools did they think they had to choose from? What institutions ... or capabilities did they have or not have?""After the initial lockdowns – which actually folks at the time thought would only last for a few weeks – people really didn't know what to do ... With no tools, flying blind, we had to rely on all these blunt instruments, which then polarized the country.On developing a vaccine and Operation Warp SpeedIt was a success. Actually, President Trump himself had almost nothing to do with it. I think we have the best account of the origins of Warp Speed that's available in print right now. And we kind of explain what it is about it that actually worked, and also what about it really didn't work. A lot of people think of it, for instance, as a research and development program. Mostly it wasn't. Pfizer actually refused to participate in Warp Speed in developing its vaccine. It was, above all, a manufacturing and distribution program. And Pfizer, in fact, did participate in that part of it, and that's where it achieved its great successes.If politics were at play in creating the vaccineWell, politics are always in play when you're developing health decisions for hundreds of millions of people. And politics were in play here, too.Actually, the remarkable thing about Warp Speed was that it was relatively insulated from the cronyism and chaos that characterized so much of the Trump administration. It was insulated partly because a lot of it was lodged in the Department of Defense. And both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs helped to insulate the program from political interference. And actually, we give some credit to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who helped to insulate the program's management from some of his colleagues in the administration who would have interfered more with it.What lessons did you learn from the messaging around the vaccine?Well, the communication was terrible, if I may be blunt. The good news is that we have actually learned a lot about how to do good communication with people in a crisis. The bad news is we disregarded practically all of that knowledge and those lessons in this crisis. The persuasive efforts that worked – and people did some of this – is where you actually reached out to leaders in local communities ... Some of those efforts worked quite well in persuading people to use the vaccine. But in general, at a national level, the communication efforts were poor. And actually those problems extended on into the Biden administration as well.What is the teachable moment for the next virus?I mean, this is really a crisis of competence. It's not a crisis of science. It's not a crisis of unwillingness to spend money. It's not a crisis in the sense that, ""Gosh, no one had ever heard of a pandemic danger."" There were great movies and books about it, so people knew about the danger. They had science. They were willing to spend money. The failure was in knowing what to do and how to do it and then getting ready to do it. It's like an emergency doctor who has an emergency in front of them on the gurney and is given a textbook and a bunch of money. But that doesn't tell them, ""Yeah, but I need to punch a hole in this person's chest to relieve the pressure on their heart. And how do I do that and have the training and confidence to do that in a crisis?"" And this book really is kind of a revelation about, how do we restore a reputation for competence and problem solving?

7456,Translating difficult ideas into everyday life: Marcia Bartusiak on being a science communicator,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/23/translating-difficult-ideas-into-everyday-life-marcia-bartusiak-on-being-a-science-communicator,The author and journalist talked about being a woman in a male-dominated field.,"With Women's History Month underway, GBH’s Morning Edition is highlighting how women are excelling in fields that are traditionally dominated by men, like science, technology, engineering and math. There are still significant barriers to entry in those fields, including an exposure gap. One person looking to break those barriers is Marcia Bartusiak, an author, journalist and professor of the practice emeritus at MIT, who's been covering the fields of astronomy and physics for four decades. She joined Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel for a discussion. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: It's a pleasure to have you. So you're kind of a legend in the field. You were among the first to report on discoveries like dark matter and meteorites from Mars. You have a long and storied career reporting on science and writing about science. Tell us a bit about your trajectory, like how you ended up in the space in the first place. Marcia Bartusiak: I have a very unusual background. I started out actually in journalism. I myself was inspired while I was in high school by the first female reporter at a local TV station in the Norfolk, Virginia Beach area. And I was determined — ""Oh, I like that, I'll go into that."" So I went to school, got a degree in journalism, went back to Norfolk and became her rival reporter at another station. But the NASA Langley Research Center was nearby. And when I did stories there, I was in love with covering science. And I said, ""If I could do this 24/7, I would be in heaven."" So I actually went back to school to pump up my science background and ended up with a master's degree in physics, and then went on to combine those two fields to write on the field of science. Paris Alston: It's fascinating because science is sometimes something very complicated to communicate. Even like Jeremy and I, we do science stories here. We do our absolute best. I think sometimes we knock it out and then sometimes it knocks us out. How are you able to transfer and merge those two worlds to make something that's been digestible for everyday people? Bartusiak: Well, I like to quote The New York Times reporter George Johnson: ""to take the strange and make it familiar."" And that's my passion: to get people excited about something. They think, ""Oh, my gosh, I couldn't possibly understand that."" But that's the role of a science writer, is to take those, what seemed to be difficult ideas and, through metaphors and analogies, show how it affects your everyday life, or explain them with examples that they would be familiar with from their everyday life. And women can bring a perspective on this. I was thinking of one story I did — I was talking to some theoretical physicists about: What is the nature of space-time? And on the tiniest of levels, they had a theory that it was made up of these little loops of energy. And a male reporter who reported on this as well described it as a medieval soldier's chainmail. I preferred thinking of it as weaving a blanket of space-time. So a woman can bring a different perspective, different analogies. That's what we can add to these different viewpoints. Alston: Next time we talk about space, we've got to remember blankets. Siegel: Yeah, we'll bring our blankets. So as we're thinking about some of the lingering gender disparities in science fields, I've told Paris a number of times that I was a failed science major in college — started out as a chemistry major, and ended up switching to something different. But looking back at my time in college, which wasn't too long ago: especially in math and engineering classes, it was mostly men. And so even though we've made a lot of progress, there are still significant, lingering barriers for young women and girls entering STEM fields. As a science writer who is making these things more accessible to people who they might not be accessible to, how can we do a better job of talking about and writing about science? Bartusiak: Great strides have been made in the biological sciences. Women are now pretty much in parity with the men in terms of numbers. It's the physical sciences: engineering, mathematics. And for me, because it helped me to be inspired by a role model, I think the same can be true in science. More women science teachers to serve as mentors; of course, more women scientists; but also I think communicators like me and others can play a role. I think it's important for young girls, young women, to see a woman's byline in the newspaper or on the cover of a book, to hear a woman's voice on the radio. To see a woman's face on TV. And I have to give a shout out to those women scientists who are using social media, the great means of communications for the current generation on TikTok, on YouTube, to do these wonderful little short programs explaining various aspects of science. I think that can be very important. So it's also breaking down those stereotypes, that somehow if you're going to major in a hard science that, ""Oh, I'm not going to get that boyfriend."" But I think seeing these role models around them more and more, and seeing more women in science communication. And women are now the major science communicators! That wasn't the case when I entered the field in the 1980s. Men were the dominant science communicators. Now it's women. And I think that may be, not of a large part, but playing a role in attracting more young girls and young women. Alston: So in the 30 seconds we have left here, Marcia, I mean, what are some of the challenges that women face once they get into those fields? And how can the fields adjust to be more welcoming to them? Bartusiak: I think they have to know that sometimes women will have different reactions than a man in terms of how they're absorbing the material. And I think that all of the science instructors, male or female, have to understand that. Some women may not be as aggressive. I think I was fortunate in that I went back to school after having worked in the real world, so that I wasn't afraid of confronting a professor or asking a question in class. And I think those skill sets need to be addressed, perhaps even at a high-school level, that women know they can have a voice.",Local,"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 12:25:42 EST",e6160f0082a2ec9bfbded1243814b385
5846,Photographer Aïda Muluneh created public art for Boston's bus stops,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/photographer-aida-muluneh-created-public-art-for-bostons-bus-stops,Her exhibit is part of a global public art project.,"The other day, I was walking near a bus stop by the Common when I saw something interesting: At the bus stop, in that usual spot where you'd see an ad, there was this big, vibrant piece of art.But it wasn't actually a painting. It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: Aïda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. She’s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa. The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called “This is Where I Am.”“I have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,” Muluneh said. “I think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.”Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery. Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said. “I know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,” she said. “For those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.”She brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props. “I utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,” Muluneh said. “It's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.”This project is the first time in her career that she’s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square. “I liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,” Muluneh said. “To try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style. She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art. “It's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,” Muluneh said. “I enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.”",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:07:11 EST",12b2470c97737347d09baaf3708aee2a
497,Boston redistricting challenge kicks off in federal court,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/28/boston-redistricting-challenge-kicks-off-in-federal-court,At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty takes the stand for three hours as a witness.,"The process that yielded Boston’s latest voting map was both a strategy to protect incumbents and a “racial diluting” of the city’s long-held majority-minority seat in Mattapan, At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty testified in federal court Tuesday.His comments came during the opening hearing of the case challenging the legality of the voting map approved by the council and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last November.Flaherty, who is in his 20th year on the Boston City Council, argued fellow councilors who ultimately approved the map were less experienced with the redistricting process and wrongly focused on racial demographics. “We’re here today because people disregarded the advice of professional experts,” Flaherty proclaimed, pointing to a memo drafted by Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and adjunct professor at New York Law School. The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including “population equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.”“[The council’s] primary objective,” Flaherty argued, was “population balancing” — which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city’s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city’s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. “We didn’t need to do anything else,” he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council’s “rushed” adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.""I need to have this done by the end of April?"" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty’s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston’s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.“This case is ultimately about choices,” said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made “modest” changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city’s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city’s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city’s redistricting committee amid last year’s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday’s hearing and said his colleague’s testimony illustrated “just how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.”“I think it’s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs … and I think it’s pretty clear at this point that there’s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,"" he said. The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday.",Politics,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:32:10 EST",1ef343cc378be0db19c68c6b3ff0f19a

Herwick III embedded himself at the beloved drinking spot.","To say that Sligo Pub was a fixture in Somerville’s Davis Square would be something of an understatement.The small, nearly windowless hole-in-the-wall holds the oldest liquor license in the neighborhood, according to its website. And according to Tom Mannion, who ran Sligo from 1989 until his death last year, the space — once called Mahoney’s and prior to that Pat Connelly’s — has been a bar since at least 1932.Somerville’s Ivonne Blanco, a regular patron for years, described it as “a pleasantly gnarly dive bar.”No longer.We spent some time in Sligo during its final week talking with numerous loyal patrons to find out what set it apart from the multitudes of other bars, why its closure is hitting them so hard and how it will be remembered.“Everything else is like a bistro pub, it's a brewery. And this is just, it just screams, 'It's a bar,'” said patron Dave Wasserman.“The bathrooms are gross, they don't serve food, but it's all these things that kind of make it what it is” said Ulysses Lateiner. “It's the last bar of it's kind of just Davis Square and things definitely won't be the same when it's gone.” The rumblings of Sligo’s demise started to churn through Somerville in 2019, when real estate developer Scape purchased the block of Elm Street — home to Sligo and other restaurants and businesses — for nearly $10 million. Speculation at the time was that Scape would develop the block into a large residential building for students, a specialty of the British-based firm. But last year, Scape announced they would construct a four-story life sciences complex that will include lab and commercial space at the street level.When Somerville’s planning board approved the project in September 2022, Sligo’s operators said the deal most likely spelled its end. When the news finally broke this spring that Sligo’s was closing for good on June 4, it elicited everything from despair on social media, to elegies in the local press, to philosophical musings from Sligo regulars. “You catch me on a good day and it's like, well, that's the reality of the world,” said Tim Dalton, who’s been coming to Sligo for four decades. “Catch me on a bad day and there's just real anger that a lot of, you know, old Boston is disappearing.”“You meet a lot of different people – characters I guess you could call it,” said bartender Sean McDonald. “People are tethered to this place, or their friendship is tethered through this place.”",Local,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 09:18:24 EST",d192544b1e89ad093a2b3aa83758db6e

That didn't happen, for the most part. But almost three years on, some police departments are shrinking anyway.","During the George Floyd protests of 2020, many people called for the defunding of traditional police. That didn't happen, for the most part. But almost three years on, some police departments are shrinking anyway. A new criminology study of 14 large police departments found most have had an ""excess"" loss of sworn, full-time officers since 2020, a trend verified in core-city agencies such as the New Orleans Police Department. In 2010, NOPD had about 1,500 officers; a decade later, it was at about 1,200. Since 2020, the department is down by another 20% to 944. Despite doubled recruiting efforts, the department continues to shrink.""We're looking at a situation where the department this year has already lost almost 20 officers,"" says Jeff Asher, a public safety consultant who tracks the city's police staffing for the New Orleans City Council. ""It really impacts everything. You're seeing response times that have gone from an average of about 50 minutes for any type of call in 2019 to over two and a half hours last year. And, so far, a little bit worse this year.""Even lifelong residents of New Orleans say they see the difference. ""I am off the street every day by 4 p.m.,"" says Delores Montgomery, a ride-share driver. She says she was especially shaken by the recent killing of another ride-share driver, as well as her own experience last year, seeing a couple running after their stolen car at a gas station in broad daylight.""It's just one thing after another and you just sit there with your mouth open,"" she says. ""Criminals know there's not enough officers on the street! They know this!""New Orleans, which used to be ranked among the deadliest cities in the 1990s and late 2000s, likely reclaimed the dubious distinction of the worst per capita murder rate among cities with more than 250,000 residents last year. Rank-and-file officers say they're less able to be a presence in crime hotspots, because of the personnel shortage.""We're dealing with a 1,600-officer police department being operated by 900 officers,"" says Capt. Mike Glasser, a veteran with the New Orleans Police Department who's also the president of the Police Association of New Orleans (PANO).Glasser blames the dwindling staff on officer mistrust of leadership, as well as stair-step financial incentives that can cause officers to retire early. There's also been intense pressure from other departments, who recruit NOPD away to quieter jobs in the suburbs. Regardless of the causes, Glasser says it's time to accept certain realities.New Orleans Police Department is trying to get less risky duties off its plate""We really have never retooled the department,"" Glasser says. ""There are some things that we should probably abbreviate — or eliminate, temporarily — in order to basically triage the crime problem.""One thing NOPD is trying to get off its plate: Less-risky police duties, such as going to the scene of noninjury car wrecks.""Citizens still call 911, their call is still dispatched. However, it is dispatched to our agents,"" says Ethan Cheramie, founder of a company called On Scene Services (OSS). It employs unarmed, former police officers who go to the scenes of wrecks to take information and provide reports.""Our agents respond in a timely, efficient manner, to let everybody get on with their day,"" Cheramie says. OSS has had two cars responding to crashes in New Orleans for the past five years, and with the worsening officer shortage, the city has just signed an expanded contract for seven OSS cars — enough, Cheramie figures, to free up the equivalent of 15 fulltime officers for other duties.""You're going to continue to see alternative police response be divested from guys with guns over to civilians to respond to these nonviolent calls for service,"" Cheramie says. And yet, the city's follow-through has been slow. Last year, NOPD pledged to hire civilians for 50 new positions doing traditional police jobs such as fingerprinting and property crime investigations. There were more than enough qualified applicants, but so far the department has announced only three hires. In an email to NPR, NOPD cited the ""multiple steps"" involved in hiring civilians, but reaffirmed ""how crucial it is to hire both commissioned and professional staff.""The department would not make anyone available for interviews, citing the staffing shortage.Another factor that may be complicating the process is political turmoil. The department has experienced command reshuffles in recent months, and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell faces a possible recall election. Some of the resistance to civilianization may also be coming from the police themselves. PANO president Mike Glasser says the best solution to the officer shortage is consolidation —putting investigations under one roof— rather than just hiring more civilians. The problem with civilian hires, he says, is that they can do only the jobs they're hired to do. If the department suddenly needs extra personnel for, say, crowd control during Mardi Gras, they can't help.""Should we civilianize some things? Probably so, we should. Other things, I've got to caution, that's not a long-term, enduring philosophy,"" Glasser says.Nationally, more police are expressing interest in civilianizing some of their work. The union for Los Angeles police officers, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, recently proposed that civilians respond to more nonviolent 911 calls, such as welfare checks and loud parties. But, like New Orleans, cities that have pledged to move in that direction are having trouble following through — Baltimore City police, for instance. Last year the department said it would hire civilian investigators; a year later, their training has yet to start.

1466,"Ludlow's school library proposal, either a highway to censorship or a barrier to 'pornography'",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/29/ludlows-school-library-proposal-either-a-highway-to-censorship-or-a-barrier-to-pornography,The proposed policy would give elected school officials decision-making powers that could override librarians.,"The School Committee in Ludlow, Massachusetts, is scheduled to vote next month on a controversial proposal that could significantly alter the types of books and media allowed in the district’s libraries. It could also take away significant decision-making from librarians.At a School Committee meeting this week, parents and educators spoke their minds about the proposal for almost two hours.It was clear from the public comments: both sides showed up to protect their children, their beliefs and their freedom of speech.When parent Bella Soares stepped up to the microphone Tuesday, it wasn't the first time the district had heard from her about school library books she believes are inappropriate for students. That includes an illustrated book about puberty, ""Sex is a Funny Word.”Soares is part of an organized group called Ludlow Concerned Parents, according to a meeting agenda from a 2022 Select Board meeting.The recently proposed library policy echoes Soares’ activism of the last few years.At Tuesday's meeting, she first directed her comments to the parents and educators in the auditorium who disagree with her — who say the proposed policy is exclusionary, arbitrary and discriminatory against students who identify as LGBTQ.""Get this all through your heads,"" Soares said. ""You guys are the ones that are making it [about] LGBTQ. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with pornographic books in our school — drugs, rape, obscenity books. That's what we're trying to eliminate here.""Soares then read a passage aloud from a 2005 coming-of-age novel, John Green's ""Looking for Alaska."" Soares said the book is currently available to Ludlow sixth, seventh and eighth graders.The scene depicts the start and completion of a sexual act between a teenage boy and girl, while they're watching ""The Brady Bunch.""After reading, Soares said, ""So now you tell me if this is not pornography! This is definitely pornography!""That prompted shouts from others the crowd of about 150 people. It was one of several times that night the school committee chair asked people to settle down and follow protocol.It was Ludlow School Committee Member Joao Dias who a few weeks ago proposed the new library materials policy.On Tuesday, along with the rest of the committee, Dias sat at a table at the front of the room. Surrounding him were 10 books books he had taken out from the public library — to make a point.They don't belong on the shelves of a school library, he said, and he proposed the new policy because it's needed.""We've had complaints ongoing for the past six years. I think the chairman himself said that. [And] possible lawsuits from parents,"" Dias said, ""and that's a real thing, and that's based on what's going on now, not what might be from a civil liberties union that doesn't protect any civil liberties.""The ACLU of Massachusetts has called Dias' proposal unlawful and a not-very-veiled attempt to suppress literature about LGBTQ experiences.Dias said he found the policy online, from the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania. The ACLU has challenged that district's policy with a federal lawsuit.The proposed policy in Ludlow would give elected school officials like Dias decision-making powers about materials that could override librarians. Several were at the meeting and said they were not consulted by the school committee.The policy could also lead to the firing of school employees who don't follow the rules or who encourage certain books.The majority of people speaking out at the meeting were against Dias' proposal. One called it a moral crusade; another, a culture war.Mike Kelliher, a parent and former school committee member, said it’s very sad for him to have to address the committee in this way.""This policy originated from a hate group in Pennsylvania and somehow managed to find its way onto your agenda,"" he said. ""And I think we need to know how that happened. I hope that's something that will be discussed tonight because that's important. It's important to know who's pulling the strings behind the scenes on some of our committee members.""The rancor brought about by the proposal may cover up that some parents in Ludlow have real concerns their children have access to inappropriate material.Longtime Ludlow teacher Michelle Annecchiarico stood up at the microphone and said she understands that. She herself has questioned certain books available to middle schoolers, and questioned librarians.She's told parents she'll help them do likewise, and help but none have taken her up on the offer.But no one in the schools, Annecchiarico said, is pushing porn on students or trying to sexualize them.""We are up against cell phones, social media, all-access 24/7 TV, YouTube, TikTok, 'Squid Games' ... we have kids who are allowed to watch 'Squid Games!'"" she said.At the meeting, three out of five School Committee members made statements indicating their opposition to Dias’ proposal. Things get heated.Several people said the School Committee failed the district and are getting distracted by the loudest voices.Some came to the meeting to talk about the school budget — and maybe to ask the superintendent about the 25 educators, including a couple of librarians, who are slated to be laid off.That, they said, is what school officials should have been talking about.",Local,"Mon, 29 May 2023 05:00:34 EST",900d7ce84a99bb9f46d75699d9886a24
1616,Veterans group calls for stronger law enforcement action against neo-Nazis in New England,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/25/veterans-group-calls-for-stronger-law-enforcement-action-against-neo-nazis-in-new-england,Lengthy report on NSC-131 finds eight violent actions in recent years.,"A veterans group is calling on law enforcement across New England to take a harder stance against a neo-Nazi organization that has targeted Jewish, Black and LGBTQ communities in the region. The Task Force Butler Institute, a self described anti-fascist research group made up of U.S. military vets, released a 300-page report Tuesday documenting acts of violence carried out in recent years by the Nationalist Social Club-131, or NSC-131. The Anti-Defamation League describes NSC-131 as ""a neo-Nazi group with small, autonomous regional chapters."" Kris Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and founder of the nonprofit research organization Task Force Butler, said the group shared the report with law enforcement officials with one goal in mind. ""We hope that with 300 pages of evidence of violent hate crimes across four different states, that attorneys general, districts attorneys across various states and counties and cities will work together and treat NSC-131 like what it is — a violent gang — and get creative,"" he said. ""Use things like racketeering laws to dismantle them, charge them with hate crimes.""Last year, NSC-131 hung a sign at the St. Patrick’s Day parade in Boston that read “Keep Boston Irish.”New England actions by the group also include a fight that broke out during a NSC-131 protest last July outside of a drag story hour near the Loring Greenough House in Jamaica Plain, one of eight violent acts outlined in the report. The report points to a more recent NSC-131 disruption in downtown Portland, Maine on April 1 when members of the group paraded through the area making Nazi salutes and engaging in fights with counter-protesters. Task Force Butler veterans say charges filed in New Hampshire against the group in January are a step in the right direction. New Hampshire Attorney General John M. Formella charged the group and two of its leaders with violating the state's Civil Rights Act and conspiring to violate the New Hampshire Civil Rights Act after posting a banner over an overpass that read ""Keep New England white.""In interviews with GBH News last year, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins argued that NSC-131 should be classified as a street gang. The veterans group says that, among its priorities, is investigating white supremacists who have joined the ranks of the U.S. military, as documented by FBI arrest records of those who took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Task Force Butler researchers identified at least seven members and affiliates of NSC-131 as military veterans. The report is not for public consumption is being made available as a source of information for local, state and federal officials, news organizations and research groups focused on right-wing extremism. ""Most of the evidence that we have gathered has been posted by NSC-131 themselves,"" Goldsmith said. ""They have been operating throughout New England in what they feel to be such a permissive environment that they videotape their violent hate crimes. And really, honestly, so far, their behavior of years of posting criminal activity online and not having law enforcement seem to act on it, they have reason to feel invincible."" Goldsmith said the reason that he and other veterans are involved with exposing far-right extremism is because of their ""commitment to democracy."" ""We recognize that people respect the platform that we have, and that is why we are leveraging our veterans status to say we served our country and we are continuing to serve our country here at home in what is at least, speaking for myself, having served in Iraq, in a mission that is in every way much more aligned with defending democracy than anything I ever did in uniform.""",National,"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 18:11:20 EST",ce67d9e0c1d16c905957e62268d8c287

Levin's widower Peter DeMarco was the driving force behind the new regulations. He said on Greater Boston that the legislative process for Laura's Law was very long and challenging, but well worth the effort. ""Hospitals have all these regulations, all these nuts and bolts directing them on what changes they need to make, and that's an incredible thing to say,"" DeMarco said. Jan Carpman, an architectural sociologist and wayfinding consultant, says many factors can improve emergency department accessibility such as location, signage, parking, lighting, intercom system and more. ""All of those elements would have helped Laura that night,"" DeMarco said.Carpman recommended that people plan out hospital access before an emergency happens, and find out whether or not your insurance would cover the cost of an ambulance.

Maura Healey on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in connection with a sharp uptick in the number of migrant families arriving in Massachusetts and needing shelter. The governor coupled the order with what she called an “urgent and formal appeal” for the federal government to act on immigration policy. Nearly 5,600 families with children — more than 20,000 people total — are living in state-funded shelters, hotels, dormitories and emergency facilities across the state, Healey said. That number is up from around 3,100 families a year ago, according to the governor's office.“It’s more families than our state has ever served, exponentially more than our state has ever served, in our emergency assistance program,” she said. “Those numbers are being driven by a surge in new arrivals who have been through some of the hardest journeys imaginable. They are the face of the national — international — migrant crisis. They’re here because where they came from is too dangerous to stay. They’re here because Massachusetts has and will always be a beacon of hope, compassion, humanity and opportunity.”Healey sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying that while Massachusetts is adding shelter units by the week, she fears that ""without extraordinary measures ... we will be unable to add capacity fast enough to place all eligible families safely into shelter."" “We need action to remove barriers and expedite federal work authorizations,” Healey said at a State House press conference, flanked by advocates and members of her administration. “We need action and intervention for funding to help us in this time. The truth is, our new arrivals are most eager to work.” The letter cites federal policies on immigration and work authorization as one driver of the crisis, and asks the federal government to step up by removing barriers to receiving work authorizations, addressing ""outdated and punitive immigration laws"" and providing states with financial help.Healey’s declaration could open the door to increased help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Previously, municipalities in Texas that have declared similar states of emergency have been able to acquire funds from the agency, as have New York City and Chicago.Neither FEMA nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests for comment from GBH News.A state of emergency also allows for some rules in the state’s bidding process to be bypassed, and for expedited hiring of vendors and contractors for housing and social services. Healey told GBH News that her administration intends to keep existing contracts with the Brazilian Worker Center, which runs the Healey administration's Family Welcome Center in Boston, and with providers involved in another Family Welcome Center in Quincy. The center in Quincy has served 119 families since opening on July 31.The current surge in migrants locally comes as record-breaking number of immigrants arrive to the U.S. from Mexico, including Haitian and South American immigrants who are seeking asylum after fleeing political turmoil and gang violence. It also coincides with the end in May of Title 42, a Trump-era provision that allowed the immediate deportation of most migrants arriving at the southern border.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration has bused many of these migrants to Washington, D.C., and New York City. Advocates say some migrants have continued from New York City to Boston.Healey and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll also announced the creation of the Massachusetts Migrant Families Relief Fund, a partnership between the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and The Boston Foundation, kickstarted with donations of $100,000 from Eastern Bank and $50,000 from Blue Cross Blue Shield. The fund, Healey's office said, will help meet migrants' essential needs, including food, diapers, transportation and hygiene items, plus other assistance like English classes, legal assistance and health screenings.Driscoll also put out a call for Massachusetts residents to help in whatever way they can, from donating grocery gift cards to a college president or faith leader working with the state to set up extra shelter sites. “Most importantly, if you have an extra room or suite in your home, please consider hosting a family,” Driscoll said. “Safe housing and shelter is our most pressing need.”Anyone interested in hosting a family or learning more information can contact the Brazilian Worker Center, she said.Healey also cited a “longstanding shortage of affordable housing” as a contributing factor.Her letter to Mayorkas says the demand for emergency shelter ""has skyrocketed"" over the past six month, while the number of families leaving emergency shelter for safe, permanent housing has declined. It says the state of emergency will let her issue orders and recommendations to help protect people and property, expedite procurement and deployment of goods and services, and facilitate aid requests from federal, state and local partners.“This is a national issue that demands a national response,” Healey said.Massachusetts law allows a governor to issue a proclamation declaring a state of emergency when the state is facing a natural or human-made disaster, civil disturbance or certain other threats. A declared emergency grants the governor additional powers, including the ability to seize property and order business closures.The last state of emergency in Massachusetts was declared by then-Gov. Charlie Baker on March 10, 2020, as COVID-19 took hold. That designation ultimately lasted for 462 days before the state transitioned into a modified public health emergency that remained in place until this past spring. The flow of migrants has heightened in recent months, but they’ve been coming to Massachusetts for at least a year and a half in earnest. Esther, a young migrant from Haiti, said Tuesday that she arrived here with nothing to her name in September 2021.“I came with my child and I was pregnant,” she said. “I was hospitalized when I first came, and after they removed my baby, and they sent me to Immigrant Family Services Institute, which helped me find an apartment to stay.”Esther and her child, who was born healthy, were aided by the Immigrant Family Services Institute, which has been working with the state to support migrant families.Dr. Geralde Gabeau, the head of IFSI, said her organization has seen a number of migrant new mothers in recent months.Father Bill's & MainSpring, an organization that runs state-contracted shelters south of Boston, has been helping migrants coming here for some time, including those who were brought to Martha’s Vineyard by planes chartered by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last year. Of the 150 families that Father Bill's & MainSpring shelters every day, over 30% are migrant families, organization president John Yawzinski said. He noted that rate has been growing steadily.“We're really excited and thankful that the governor is basically opening up the tent and asking for the federal government, local officials, philanthropy, all stakeholders in the community to come together for this tremendous challenge,” Yawzinski said.Yawzinski added that a big challenge for migrants is obtaining work authorization, so they can earn money and access benefits like public housing. The president of Horizons for Homeless Children, an organization that contracts with the state to provide childcare services at emergency shelters, is eager to see what impact the state of emergency will have on the ground. “I'm hoping that what the state of emergency will do is bring funding into the state to help us find other healthier locations to put these families in and where we can have additional services, both for the children and for the parents onsite inside these facilities,” said Kate Barrand. She wants to provide on-site mental health services to the children at the shelters, which she says is direly needed. “A child in one of these shelters literally played out their experience at a Border Patrol crossing,” she said. “They lined up little tiny dolls in line with police cars all around them — that's a child processing trauma in a healthy way.” Federal funds acquired through a state of emergency could also trickle down to municipalities already in the thick of helping migrant families, like Boston.",Politics,"Tue, 08 Aug 2023 12:36:25 EST",ff26e905f11b9370d97d730388073c00

David Cicilline said he is stepping away from politics. Cicilline has represented Rhode Island in Congress for over a decade. During his time in office, he took on Big Tech and served as the House impeachment manager for former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. He is also openly gay and an advocate for LGBTQ rights. So with all that apparent success, why is Cicilline resigning?""There were a couple factors. One, he was offered a job as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the big nonprofit funder here in Rhode Island. He's going to more than triple his salary to $650,000 compared what he made in Congress,"" WPRI politics and business editor Ted Nesi told Under the Radar. ""And he acknowledged it was just less appealing to stay in Congress, in the U.S. House, as a Democrat who is now in the minority, with a Republican majority who has very little he agrees with them on. And if we're being honest, Cicilline tried and failed to get into senior leadership position when the House leaders were changing over."" Nesi said Cicilline's resignation was a shock to ""everyone in Rhode Island"" given the fact he was only a couple months into his latest term.Cicilline officially steps down on June 1. The special election to replace him will likely happen in November, so there will be several months without Rhode Island's 1st District represented in the U.S. House.Arnie Arnesen, host of “The Attitude with Arnie Arnesen” on WNHN, said she was angry with Democrats for not putting him in a leadership position and was sad to learn of his resignation.""Look at all these roles he played,"" she said. ""I actually kind of envisioned that maybe someday he might want to run for president. I really do think he has that kind of cred and credibility.""Also on Under the Radar's Regional News Roundtable, guests discussed the aging Bourne and Sagamore bridges. Tens of thousands of cars drive across the nearly 100-year-old bridges to Cape Cod each day. Though the bridges are in desperate need of repairs, the federal government has rejected multiple requests for funding — although President Joe Biden's latest budget proposal would include a ""down payment."" ""These bridges apparently have not a great design, and they're very difficult and expensive to repair. And it's that cost of repair — year over year — which is really driving the conversation here that they just have to be replaced entirely,"" said Steve Junker, managing editor of news at CAI. ""Right before the pandemic, they were talking about a price tag to replace both bridges of about $1 billion. And everybody thought 'Oh, that's a lot of money.' Now they're saying it could be as much as $4 billion."" Arnesen said now is the time to think big about the bridge reconstruction.""What the 'H' are you building? Because it's not just about a bridge. Because you're talking about also a bridge to the future. And what we know about the future is climate change. What we know about the future is maybe the desire for more public transportation. ... It's not just about a bridge, everyone. It changes the whole course of life.""And, lastly, Under the Radar guests discussed how a high school in New Hampshire is training students for the Granite state’s burgeoning outdoor tourism industry.

But not all job seekers have a computer, internet access or the digital know-how to submit an application.At a job fair at Greenfield Community College last month, 29 employers perched, ready, seated behind tables. One has five positions to fill. Another 50. One has 69 openings.With a labor shortage, people applying for jobs should be in the driver’s seat. But that hasn’t been the case for Jesse Morrison of Vernon, Vermont.""It’s a challenge. That’s all I can say, doing the stuff online,"" Morrison said. ""Doesn’t always go smooth.""Morrison spent more than half of his 51 years driving a propane truck. He wants to work. He has a computer and internet, but got stuck — at first — uploading a job application.""One said it had to be PDF form, when you tried to upload it. And you’re like, 'What is that? What kind of paper is that?' But it kept saying it wouldn’t do it because it wasn’t one,"" he said.Pershing Reid from Orange also has a computer and internet — and also has trouble applying online. The 72-year-old's work experience includes driving an MBTA bus in Boston. He is looking for a job driving a van or a bus.“I tried to [apply online] but I didn’t get very far,” Reid said. ""I went to the site ... of the company, but it just didn’t tell me how to get on. Because it didn’t tell how to get on, I could not apply.""Reid even visited the company in person, but they just sent him back to their website.Another company, Mativ, a plastics manufacturer in Greenfield, has 15 open positions. According to online job postings, some include a $3,000 signing bonus. HR Business Partner Crystal Fish said if an applicant is having problems submitting an application, she’d be happy to help them out.""We haven’t had anybody that’s had problems applying to our website or at least not that we’ve been made aware of,"" Fish said.In fact, most recruiters at the Greenfield job fair said they haven’t even heard of the problem.But Maura Geary, who organized the fair, knows it well. Geary is the executive director of the MassHire Franklin Hampshire Career Center.""Some people truly can't access the online application itself. So, they need to be walked through the online application,"" she said.The career center staff includes a digital navigator who offers job seekers three one-hour lessons on basics like setting up an email account and uploading a resume. The center also offers workshops.""A lot of first interviews are virtual,"" Geary said. ""We do trainings to get them up to speed on all of the different workforce tools that are necessary to get a job.""In the last couple of years, the career center has given away 592 Chromebooks. According to Geary, the state has given away 10,131 since December 2020.And if a job seeker can’t afford internet access, the center will help them apply for the Federal Communication Commission’s Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps pay for the service. The program will also help pay for a computer or tablet for eligible households.Compared to the rest of the state, Geary said Franklin and Hampshire Counties have more job seekers with disabilities, and slightly more who are 55 or over — some of whom face digital challenges.""We definitely work with mature workers who face technology barriers and also some ageism, frankly, in their search for new careers."" Geary said. Melanie Gelaznik, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Career Center, said people come in every day looking for help applying for online jobs.""People with a lower income and perhaps a lower education struggle more,"" Gelaznik said.Besides older adults and people with lower incomes, the digital divide disproportionately affects people with mental, developmental and intellectual disabilities or those with limited English, along with people who live in a place that lacks internet infrastructure.In western Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Census, Hampden County has the largest percentage of households without a computer.These digital barriers came to a head about three years ago, when a new verb entered the national lexicon: to Zoom.""We were locked-in, locked-down,"" recalled Frank Robinson, vice president for public health at Baystate Health. ""If I'm having trouble connecting, what about our consumers, residents, patients? How are they connecting to services?""Even getting a vaccine, at first, required fluency with online systems.But Robinson's concern wasn’t just about patients needing medical appointments.""How do you get food? How do you get, in those days, protective equipment? All that stuff was online. And if people weren't connected online, they were just outside any kind of protections,"" he said.He said the people most affected had experienced disparities before the pandemic.""Black, brown [people], folks living with disabilities, older adults would be also having problems because they already experienced significant inequities,"" Robinson said.Being connected and literate in digital tools is what Robinson calls a civil right and a human right.""If you don’t have that level of proficiency, you can’t fully participate in society,"" he said.In the summer of 2020, Robinson convened a meeting of concerned groups in western Massachusetts. Now 30 organizations strong, the coalition is called the Alliance for Digital Equity. It includes libraries, schools and at least one affordable housing provider.On a Tuesday night, about 10 students sit with laptops open, attending their second computer course offered by Way Finders in Holyoke. The topic that night was finances and digital tools that help people budget.Before Jose Angel Hernandez took the first course, the 58-year-old tried to submit job applications using his phone.""First of all, I didn't have a computer,"" Hernandez said, in Spanish. ""I tried to do it on my cell phone, but it was impossible because I can’t see.""That's a common problem for job seekers whose only device is a phone. As part of the course, Way Finders gave each student a Chromebook. Hernandez is practically hugging his.""This is mine,"" he said. ""Once they gifted it to me I was able to fill out the application and send my resume.""After taking his first computer course last summer, Hernandez submitted a job application online and was hired by November.""I love this job. I like to help. I love it,"" he said.He works at an office for the WIC program for Women, Infants and Children.Plus, he can shop, pay his bills, check his bank account online and have tele-health appointments with his mother’s doctor. And now — he has email.Hernandez said using a computer has helped him discover the world.""When I started to work on the computer, I realized how important it was for me. Because this opens your mind, it opens your eyes, you know, you discover the world using the computer,"" he said.His classmate, 59-year-old Grisel Monserrate, said she didn’t know much about computers before taking the courses. And now?""It makes me feel sure of myself that I can achieve many of the things that I want to,"" she said, in Spanish.Monserrate takes care of her mother, who has Alzheimers. And she started and runs a support group for other Spanish-speaking caregivers, called Cuidadores Unidos. She said her new computer skills allow her to do so much more for the group.""It makes me happy to be able to help other people,"" Monserrate said.Way Finders is about to offer computer classes for another 80 students this year with help from the Boston-based group Tech Goes Home. The first class for older adults in Springfield starts in May.Tech Goes Home teams up with organizations like Way Finders that have already built trust in their communities and trains them to teach people, some of whom have never used a computer before.Last year, Tech Goes Home had 4,000 graduates from their training workshops, all from eastern Massachusetts.Tech Goes Home CEO Dan Noyes said age, language, income and disabilities all contribute to the digital divide.""But what is even more nefarious is that the digital divide is a racial justice issue across almost every data point you look at,"" he said. ""There is a massive racial divide between those that have access and those that don't.""Noyes said the need for these skills is even more critical than it was before the pandemic, because so much of life has moved online — including in the job market.""The barriers to not only getting a job but keeping and succeeding that job are dependent a lot ways on having digital skills,"" Noyes said.In Holyoke, Monserrate said when she first came from Puerto Rico, someone told her she wouldn’t achieve anything without speaking English.""And all of this has made me feel like, 'Yes, I can.

But not all job seekers have a computer, internet access or the digital know-how to submit an application.At a job fair at Greenfield Community College last month, 29 employers perched, ready, seated behind tables. One has five positions to fill. Another 50. One has 69 openings.With a labor shortage, people applying for jobs should be in the driver’s seat. But that hasn’t been the case for Jesse Morrison of Vernon, Vermont.""It’s a challenge. That’s all I can say, doing the stuff online,"" Morrison said. ""Doesn’t always go smooth.""Morrison spent more than half of his 51 years driving a propane truck. He wants to work. He has a computer and internet, but got stuck — at first — uploading a job application.""One said it had to be PDF form, when you tried to upload it. And you’re like, 'What is that? What kind of paper is that?' But it kept saying it wouldn’t do it because it wasn’t one,"" he said.Pershing Reid from Orange also has a computer and internet — and also has trouble applying online. The 72-year-old's work experience includes driving an MBTA bus in Boston. He is looking for a job driving a van or a bus.“I tried to [apply online] but I didn’t get very far,” Reid said. ""I went to the site ... of the company, but it just didn’t tell me how to get on. Because it didn’t tell how to get on, I could not apply.""Reid even visited the company in person, but they just sent him back to their website.Another company, Mativ, a plastics manufacturer in Greenfield, has 15 open positions. According to online job postings, some include a $3,000 signing bonus. HR Business Partner Crystal Fish said if an applicant is having problems submitting an application, she’d be happy to help them out.""We haven’t had anybody that’s had problems applying to our website or at least not that we’ve been made aware of,"" Fish said.In fact, most recruiters at the Greenfield job fair said they haven’t even heard of the problem.But Maura Geary, who organized the fair, knows it well. Geary is the executive director of the MassHire Franklin Hampshire Career Center.""Some people truly can't access the online application itself. So, they need to be walked through the online application,"" she said.The career center staff includes a digital navigator who offers job seekers three one-hour lessons on basics like setting up an email account and uploading a resume. The center also offers workshops.""A lot of first interviews are virtual,"" Geary said. ""We do trainings to get them up to speed on all of the different workforce tools that are necessary to get a job.""In the last couple of years, the career center has given away 592 Chromebooks. According to Geary, the state has given away 10,131 since December 2020.And if a job seeker can’t afford internet access, the center will help them apply for the Federal Communication Commission’s Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps pay for the service. The program will also help pay for a computer or tablet for eligible households.Compared to the rest of the state, Geary said Franklin and Hampshire Counties have more job seekers with disabilities, and slightly more who are 55 or over — some of whom face digital challenges.""We definitely work with mature workers who face technology barriers and also some ageism, frankly, in their search for new careers."" Geary said. Melanie Gelaznik, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Career Center, said people come in every day looking for help applying for online jobs.""People with a lower income and perhaps a lower education struggle more,"" Gelaznik said.Besides older adults and people with lower incomes, the digital divide disproportionately affects people with mental, developmental and intellectual disabilities or those with limited English, along with people who live in a place that lacks internet infrastructure.In western Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Census, Hampden County has the largest percentage of households without a computer.These digital barriers came to a head about three years ago, when a new verb entered the national lexicon: to Zoom.""We were locked-in, locked-down,"" recalled Frank Robinson, vice president for public health at Baystate Health. ""If I'm having trouble connecting, what about our consumers, residents, patients? How are they connecting to services?""Even getting a vaccine, at first, required fluency with online systems.But Robinson's concern wasn’t just about patients needing medical appointments.""How do you get food? How do you get, in those days, protective equipment? All that stuff was online. And if people weren't connected online, they were just outside any kind of protections,"" he said.He said the people most affected had experienced disparities before the pandemic.""Black, brown [people], folks living with disabilities, older adults would be also having problems because they already experienced significant inequities,"" Robinson said.Being connected and literate in digital tools is what Robinson calls a civil right and a human right.""If you don’t have that level of proficiency, you can’t fully participate in society,"" he said.In the summer of 2020, Robinson convened a meeting of concerned groups in western Massachusetts. Now 30 organizations strong, the coalition is called the Alliance for Digital Equity. It includes libraries, schools and at least one affordable housing provider.On a Tuesday night, about 10 students sit with laptops open, attending their second computer course offered by Way Finders in Holyoke. The topic that night was finances and digital tools that help people budget.Before Jose Angel Hernandez took the first course, the 58-year-old tried to submit job applications using his phone.""First of all, I didn't have a computer,"" Hernandez said, in Spanish. ""I tried to do it on my cell phone, but it was impossible because I can’t see.""That's a common problem for job seekers whose only device is a phone. As part of the course, Way Finders gave each student a Chromebook. Hernandez is practically hugging his.""This is mine,"" he said. ""Once they gifted it to me I was able to fill out the application and send my resume.""After taking his first computer course last summer, Hernandez submitted a job application online and was hired by November.""I love this job. I like to help. I love it,"" he said.He works at an office for the WIC program for Women, Infants and Children.Plus, he can shop, pay his bills, check his bank account online and have tele-health appointments with his mother’s doctor. And now — he has email.Hernandez said using a computer has helped him discover the world.""When I started to work on the computer, I realized how important it was for me. Because this opens your mind, it opens your eyes, you know, you discover the world using the computer,"" he said.His classmate, 59-year-old Grisel Monserrate, said she didn’t know much about computers before taking the courses. And now?""It makes me feel sure of myself that I can achieve many of the things that I want to,"" she said, in Spanish.Monserrate takes care of her mother, who has Alzheimers. And she started and runs a support group for other Spanish-speaking caregivers, called Cuidadores Unidos. She said her new computer skills allow her to do so much more for the group.""It makes me happy to be able to help other people,"" Monserrate said.Way Finders is about to offer computer classes for another 80 students this year with help from the Boston-based group Tech Goes Home. The first class for older adults in Springfield starts in May.Tech Goes Home teams up with organizations like Way Finders that have already built trust in their communities and trains them to teach people, some of whom have never used a computer before.Last year, Tech Goes Home had 4,000 graduates from their training workshops, all from eastern Massachusetts.Tech Goes Home CEO Dan Noyes said age, language, income and disabilities all contribute to the digital divide.""But what is even more nefarious is that the digital divide is a racial justice issue across almost every data point you look at,"" he said. ""There is a massive racial divide between those that have access and those that don't.""Noyes said the need for these skills is even more critical than it was before the pandemic, because so much of life has moved online — including in the job market.""The barriers to not only getting a job but keeping and succeeding that job are dependent a lot ways on having digital skills,"" Noyes said.In Holyoke, Monserrate said when she first came from Puerto Rico, someone told her she wouldn’t achieve anything without speaking English.""And all of this has made me feel like, 'Yes, I can. Yes, I will achieve it.' And that makes me feel happy,"" she said.Her goal: start an in-home day care for children.SeparatorThis story was originally published on New England Public Media.

3128,Residents’ union push at Mass General Brigham moves to formal election,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/04/residents-union-push-at-mass-general-brigham-moves-to-formal-election,The state’s largest health care system opted not to voluntarily recognize the union.,"A long-brewing union effort at Massachusetts General Brigham hospitals moved forward this week after a majority of the hospital’s medical residents, interns, fellows and other trainees signed cards indicating their support for a union. The hospital declined to voluntarily recognize the union on Monday. For workers, the next step is a formal election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, something employees hope to hold by the end of April. If successful, the state’s largest health care system would join a wave of unionization at hospitals across the country. The union effort at Mass General Brigham began at the start of the pandemic, growing as pressure mounted on frontline workers, including trainees who were often pushed into different roles. “During COVID, people were pulled off of electives to work in the hospital,” said Dr. Sascha Murillo, a third-year internal medicine resident at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Things that were kind of career-defining were put on hold so that we could take care of patients in the hospital due to COVID.” Pandemic burnout was a major factor in the decision to move forward with a union, according to Dr. Kayty Himmelstein, a fifth-year infectious disease fellow at both Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s. “It was really scary and dramatic, but it was also something we were really proud to be able to do,” Himmelstein said. “All we really wanted was for our work to be respected, for our employer to compensate us fairly and to have concern for our safety and the well-being of our patients. Unfortunately, while all of our frontline providers were really doing our best to care for our neighbors, we didn’t really feel like our employer had our back.” In deciding not the voluntarily recognize the union, Mass General Brigham cited “the unreliability of union cards as an indication of employee support due to the fact that peer pressure is so often a factor,” according to a statement from Mass General Brigham’s interim chief academic officer Paul Anderson. The union effort seeks representation from the Committee of Interns and Residents, a local branch of the Service Employees International Union, for more than 2,500 employees in residencies, fellowships and training programs at Mass General Brigham hospitals including Massachusetts General Hospital, Mass Eye and Ear, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Newton-Wellesley Hospital, Salem Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Center. Himmelstein said residents regularly work 80-hour weeks and 24-hour shifts while struggling to make ends meet. “People are living paycheck to paycheck. They’re rationing food at the end of the month. They’re turning down the heat,” she said. “What we’re looking for is compensation that would allow folks to meet their basic needs, live close to the hospitals and continue to focus on our patients.” Grueling schedules take a toll on the health of medical residents, Himmelstein said, which trickles down to patients. “When we’re working 80 hours and sometimes more a week, we’re often not able to access routine primary care, dental cleanings, prenatal appointments and other things we need to do to take care of ourselves,” she said. “When we’re not able to care for ourselves, when we’re worried about our own survival, we’re not able to bring the best of ourselves to our patients.” Residents say they have been called into meetings with their supervisors to discuss the union effort, and multiple emails have been sent out to staff with information regarding the union. “If there were ever a time to not sign a card, that time is now,” an email from last month reads. The risk of unionizing, hospital representatives wrote, would mean that “your entire relationship with Mass General Brigham — including program and education leadership — would change, and in many ways you might not like.” Trainees who begin their first year of residency this summer will earn a salary of $78,540, according to Mass General Brigham’s salary scale. Last month, hospital officials announced a 10% salary increase for all residents and clinical fellows, a $10,000 annual stipend, and increases in health insurance benefits, according to a statement from a hospital spokesperson. Health insurance has been offered at no cost to all residents since last year, and that benefit will be extended to fellows starting in July, at the onset of staff turnover. The hospital says the wage and benefit increases were not related to union activity, but part of a “multi-year process” to adjust compensation and benefits, according to a web page created by the hospital to answer questions about the union effort. “Mass General Brigham has always been and remains committed to providing very competitive and attractive wages and benefits to our Trainees,” the website reads. “Our residents and clinical fellows are integral to patient care and represent our next generation of physicians.” These changes have been requested for years, Himmelstein said. “We’ve been describing how we’re struggling to afford to live in Boston and we haven’t really received much of a response, and so we’re really glad that our organizing effort has achieved this response,” she said. “We want to make sure that we defend it, and that it’s written into our contracts so that we can continue to advocate and so that our future colleagues who come after us will be able to advocate for the resources they need.”",Local,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 17:28:11 EST",2636dca971ebf6c03e40f0cacb65ad67
1650,What’s at stake in the college affirmative action case before the Supreme Court?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/06/14/whats-at-stake-in-the-college-affirmative-action-case-before-the-supreme-court,A ruling could end 40 years of improved diversity on campuses,"Updated at 11:09 a.m. June 15SeparatorThe U.S. Supreme Court is poised to issue a historic ruling this month affecting how colleges consider race in admissions. Here's what you need to know about the decades-long debate over affirmative action and the potential effects of the court's decision.The case could upend 40 years of legal precedent and fundamentally alter the landscape of higher education by making race considerations in college admissions illegal.Decades ago, colleges began considering race as one factor among many in the admissions process as a way to help remediate past discrimination, including the effects of slavery. If the Supreme Court ends affirmative action and colleges curtail the consideration of race as a factor in admission, campuses could become far less racially diverse.In the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court ruled that racial quotas in admissions were unconstitutional. That decision came after Allan Bakke, a white student, was twice rejected from UC Davis’ medical program, leading him to challenge the constitutionality of its affirmative action program. In his majority decision supporting UC Davis, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, a Virginian nominated by President Richard Nixon, held out Harvard’s admissions program was an example of how race can properly be taken into account in college admissions.""Race is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity, but it is only one factor weighed competitively against a number of other factors deemed relevant,” Powell wrote. “Under such a system, each applicant is treated as an individual regardless of race and is considered in competition for each seat in the class.""Nine years ago, a group called Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard University. Led by Edward Blum, a conservative legal strategist and longtime critic of race-based admissions, the group claimed Harvard held Asian-American applicants to higher academic and personal standards in the admissions process.Harvard denied those charges, arguing that race is just one factor in its admissions criteria. Harvard also noted that its population of Asian-American students doubled from 15 to 30 percent in the last 20 years. No Asian American applicants took the stand to testify that they were denied admission to Harvard because of their race. The plaintiffs relied on statistical analysis and administrative notes in the margins that they claimed exhibited implicit bias.In 2019, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants. Students For Fair Admissions disagreed. The group appealed the judge’s ruling and filed another lawsuit against the University of North Carolina. Those complaints have reached the Supreme Court.Last October, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and members of the majority conservative court asked questions from the bench that were deeply skeptical of the educational value of racial diversity. Many experts now predict the court will strike down race-conscious admissions.Thomas is expected to issue the majority opinion on the case, which ironically benefitted students like him in the 1960s. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester through a program designed to make the campus more racially diverse.In his 2008 memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" Thomas said he felt stigmatized by affirmative action because his classmates at Holy Cross and later at Yale Law School viewed him as a beneficiary of the program and not as an accomplished student.Nine states already have bans against race-conscious college admissions: Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington. States that have banned affirmative action have seen a growing gap between the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American high school graduates compared to the percentage of those students enrolled in large public universities.After California voters enacted a statewide ban in 1996, Black enrollment at the University of California's most selective schools dropped dramatically. At U.C.L.A., the percentage of Black students fell by more than half, from 7% to about 4% within two years. Colleges have said they will continue their efforts to admit a racially diverse student body and even boost their recruitment efforts. Some civil rights activists have said that’s not enough, and have proposed adopting slave descent as a factor in admissions.Such an approach is akin to “legacy admissions,” under which the children of alumni get prioritized in admissions, advocates have said. “Affirmative action, when it started, was aimed at addressing and remedying the history of discrimination against Black Americans and trying to open up opportunities for them,” said Ted Shaw, director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina. “It would be correct to return to the roots of these efforts.""Critics have questioned that approach, saying it would leave out other marginalized racial and ethnic groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who could be affected by a potential ban.SeparatorCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated which states have bans on affirmative action in college admissions.",Education,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 05:00:57 EST",41dd1045673074271a00f6a1ba205ed3
5459,Why more Pride parades are popping up in Massachusetts' small cities,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/31/why-more-pride-parades-are-popping-up-in-massachusetts-small-cities,"Organizers want LGBTQ+ residents to feel at home in small towns and cities like Newburyport, not just major urban centers.","On a blindingly bright morning, Paul Goldberg looked up a main street in downtown Newburyport, pointing out the route he helped plan for the small city's first Pride parade. This Saturday, the inaugural event will step off from the old court house. “We’ll walk down Green Street to the end,” he said, turning to look north, “cross over to the waterfront there and walk along the boardwalk, just a short way into Waterfront Park.” Just over a year ago, it’s an event that would’ve been a distant dream in the city of less than 20,000. Last May, plans for a queer youth dance were thrown into chaos when the venue, a local Masonic lodge, abruptly pulled out less than two weeks before the event. The social organization’s statewide leadership had gone over members’ heads and called off the dance, seemingly over concerns about hosting an event for LGBTQ+ youth with a drag queen. But just as quickly, Newburyport’s community responded with a rush of support. Five venues offered up their spaces. Locals put together a welcoming wall of neighbors, where more than a hundred people showed up to wave flags, celebrate and stand in solidarity with the high schoolers. And the Masonic lodge went against orders: they hosted the dance anyway. It was a turning point for the city. Beyond Newburyport, organizers in small towns and cities across Massachusetts are making a concerted push for their queer neighbors feel seen and supported in their own communities, without having to go to the nearest big city. And it’s an effort that’s taken on additional meaning amid a national rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation in state legislatures. “After the ‘Over the Rainbow’ dance last May, we kind of reflected on everything that had happened — and the biggest takeaway was just this overwhelming outpouring of support from the community for our young people,” said Tarah MacGregor, who is now one of the Newburyport Pride board chairs. “We were like, ‘OK, Newburyport needs a Pride, right?’” she said. The nine-person committee in Newburyport, which had its first official meeting in December, is now putting the finishing touches on a dozen events, including a flag-raising with Gov. Maura Healey. “Every time somebody attacks our kids, it backfires ... because the community comes back with more love and more support than we could ever have imagined,” said James Giessler, who leads NAGLY, the North Shore Alliance of GLBT Youth. It co-sponsored last year’s dance. “As we see in Newburyport, with all the ruckus that they had, now they’re going to have one of the most spectacular Pride observations on the North Shore.” The Pride celebrations popping up in smaller cities and towns often take cues from the original marches, which were political protests in major cities that go back 50 years to commemorate the Stonewall riots. But today, these smaller Prides focus more on celebration, promoting visibility and making residents feel safe. Newburyport is far from Massachusetts’ first Pride outside of Boston; it’s not even the first Pride on the North Shore. Hope Watt-Bucci wanted to fight back against hate in her own community after she witnessed an older gay couple being mocked in a local restaurant and heard stories of homophobic taunts and assaults circulated on the North Shore. So, in 2012, she founded North Shore Pride and its first parade marched through Salem that June. Watt-Bucci remembered thinking she’d be glad if a hundred people came to the group’s first event. “Thousands of people showed up,” she recalled. “And I thought that, ‘OK, yeah, we need to do this. We clearly need to do this.’”Last year’s parade in Salem attracted 20,000 celebrants. Enough Pride celebrations have cropped up over the last decade that Watt-Bucci started what she calls the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together organizers from different North Shore celebrations. She and a dozen other organizers gathered on a recent Tuesday evening at a Beverly restaurant. It was a logistics-dominated evening, talking through event insurance, food trucks and 501c3 paperwork. But the room often burst into applause as organizers reveled in the dozens of events that would be held in cities and towns across the North Shore in June: drag queen bingo in Wenham, youth Pride in Lynn and a flurry of flag-raisings. This year, Topsfield is hosting Tri-town Pride for the second year with Boxford and Middleton — though it’s the first year they’ll have a parade — in response to a protest at a Boxford drag queen story hour last year. A formalized nonprofit is organizing Pride in Lynn for the first time. Revere will host its second annual “Beach Pride.” Wenham and Hamilton will have their third joint Pride picnic. Swampscott had its first Pride in 2020, and this year there’s a new addition: a “Run with Pride” 5k. Parades and other celebrations are often just “the tip of the iceberg” of deeper changes in the towns that are hosting them, according to Kim Creasap, who researches small-town Pride events in the Midwest. She’s found Ohio towns where organizers are celebrating the passage of a local ordinance, scaling up the reach of local support groups or hoping that a big celebration could be an economic boon. “There was actually a lot of advocacy behind the scenes leading up to Pride,” Creasap said, referencing those Midwestern cities and towns. “So, in other words, the Pride parades — or picnics, or festivals — were kind of a more visible consequence of a less visible community organizing that has been going on.” Joan Ilacqua leads The History Project, which preserves archives of New England’s LGBTQ+ history. She thinks part of the reason that more towns are hosting Prides is to fill the “vacuum” left by Boston Pride, which last hosted a parade in 2019, and that the increase in small-town and small-city Prides is the sign of a real shift. “People are feeling more comfortable being visible where they are, being in community with their neighbors,” Ilacqua said. “It kind of proves that you don't have to go away to the big city to be part of the queer community.”In Wenham, the third annual Pride flag raising is being organized by the city’s human rights committee. Martha Brennan, the chair, thought back to when the committee was first formed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, with the goal of making residents of all backgrounds feel more welcome in town. “One of the really endearing things that happened after our first flag raising was that a lesbian couple said it was the first time that they felt comfortable walking down the street holding hands because there’s not a lot of visibility,” Brennan recalled, referring to her town with 5,000 residents. “It’s a very small town and people are unsure of what others are thinking. And so it’s a nice way to signal that everybody’s welcome.” For Newburyport, this new chapter started with a difficult launching-off point, but one that many community members are glad to turn into a positive change for their city.The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, in a written reply to GBH News, said it decided that it was not the right organization to hold the event, and that it would have been better suited for a school or public building. Last year, members of the Masonic lodge, which had initially canceled the queer youth dance on the organizers, ended up rebelling against the statewide organization.“The feeling was overwhelming, knowing that we were providing a safe space for them,” Michael Switzer, the former leader of the St. John’s Lodge, said when he thought back on that night last spring. “Knowing that even an ounce of that discrimination and pain that they felt came from our organization, we knew that we had to do the right thing.” It came with consequences. Many of the local Masons were reprimanded, suspended or expelled from the organization for their decision. But Switzer and others decided to form a new social club called the Wolfe Club that, this year, is sponsoring Newburyport Pride and is planning its own event to raise more funds for the Pride committee. “It’s really been fulfilling for us to come full circle,” Switzer said. “When you’re an ally and you make a sacrifice, it doesn’t have to be a sad, negative story. ... And it’s really been amazing to see what we’ve been able to accomplish in a year.” Seventeen-year-old Sully McLellan was one of the high schoolers at last year’s dance — one of at least 100 kids. “There was more food than we needed. We had, like, pints of ice cream that was donated that were never broken into,” he said. “It was just a really good experience. And the drag queen was really good, too.”This year, the youth dance will be held at City Hall. McLellan is taking the lead on organizing with a blacklight, outer-space theme. Members of the new Wolfe Club will be stationed outside, donning shirts that read “safety and support.” Hundreds of T-shirts and stickers are on their way for people and businesses around town to advertise their LGBTQ+ pride, and groups are readying to march their way down Green Street to the city’s waterfront on Saturday.For parade co-chair MacGregor, who grew up in a New Hampshire town just across the border from Newburyport, it’s coming full circle, too. “Growing up as a young queer person, I didn’t feel like I had community. And being able to be part of this volunteer mission, to create community where there is so much support and where young people can grow up and see these events happening and feel valued by their community?” she said. “That’s the goal.”",Local,"Wed, 31 May 2023 05:00:29 EST",cdbbfabf364193f3888c91adad2fa96c
4259,Boston’s police oversight office has yet to uphold a single civilian complaint,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/bostons-police-oversight-office-has-yet-to-uphold-a-single-civilian-complaint,Experts say it takes time to roll out new systems — and that continued scrutiny is key.,"Nearly two years after its executive director was hired, and roughly one year after it began to operate in earnest, Boston’s Office of Police Accountability and Transparency has yet to sustain any civilian complaints against the Boston Police Department or to issue subsequent recommendations for disciplinary action, according to a review of city data by GBH News. A data dashboard on the office’s website says that in 2022 OPAT, as the office is widely known, received 56 complaints from civilians about the BPD, which employs more than 2,000 officers, and that 21 of those complaints were deemed lacking. But according to a city spokesperson, that doesn’t include more than two dozen complaints that were quickly dismissed upon initial review rather than being sent to OPAT’s Civilian Review Board for deeper consideration. When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending. The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternate mechanism through which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them. As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD. The abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking — especially given the high hopes that accompanied Boston’s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case. Everett, who was appointed as OPAT’s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role. Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.“There are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,” Everett said. “They can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.” For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT’s existence may not be enough.“While we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don’t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,” she said. “I started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it’s also a very hard ask. They don’t know who I am. They don’t know who this agency is. ... We’re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.” OPAT, which was created by a 2020 city ordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD’s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review. Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under the ordinance that created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annual report sent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether. In that same report, Everett said OPAT’s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission — like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder. In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it’s often called, mandated that investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted. “Our department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,” Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement. Gianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected. “It’s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,” Irlando said. “You have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you’re going to have access situations — because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don’t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.” Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it’s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity’s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don’t know or trust a particular oversight agency — or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well. Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who is tracking and analyzing the proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts. “The best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,” Fairley said. “And what’s good about what’s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, ‘OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.’ And then that audience — the public — can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.” Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Board can be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainant claimed they’d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent “audit” of the BPD’s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which they believed officers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights. But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago’s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.“On paper, it looked fantastic,” Fairley said. “It was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have. “You are right to be watchful,” she added. “Because we want to make sure these entities as they’re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they’ve been given over time.”",Politics,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:00:15 EST",aee50f34f54c6b6ea45590bcd8ce7eae
7704,A new governor sets the agenda for Massachusetts — does it match up with yours?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/22/a-new-governor-sets-the-agenda-for-massachusetts-does-it-match-up-with-yours,"As Gov. Maura Healey dives in to the business of governing the Commonwealth, we want to know if her agenda lines up with your own.","Gov. Maura Healey’s first several weeks in office have been a time of foundation-building: putting together her team, reintroducing herself to top lawmakers, and publicly setting the goals that will define her tenure as she leads Massachusetts. She has sketched out a first-term agenda that keys on pressing issues facing the state, like the hefty price tags for housing and child care and the threats of climate change. As a candidate and now in office, “affordability” has been a common refrain for Healey. With her blueprints drawn up, the questions now become how she’ll deliver, and how her priorities match up with those of her constituents.Healey wants to tackle housing costs that make it too expensive for renters and homeowners alike to live in Massachusetts. She plans to name a housing secretary, turn unused state land into new housing, expand deductions for renters and help first-time homebuyers.She also aims to make sure education is accessible, and see that young people have the mental health care, food security and other resources they need to thrive. Her education agenda aligns with her goal of easing pervasive, economy-wide workforce shortages. To help workers learn the skills employers are looking for, she wants to make community college free for adults over 25 without degrees. Healey also promised the plan to fund the free community college program in the state budget she'll file next month, which will also include money for 1,000 extra workers focused on MBTA operations. The safety of the T — and its basic ability to function like it's supposed to — is another area the governor's zeroed in on, along with securing federal funding to help fix dilapidated roads and bridges across the state. As governor, Healey established climate as a focal point early on, adding a climate chief to her Cabinet on her first full day office. She wants to bet big on climate technology, research, innovating and manufacturing, and create jobs in the process. However, the overall cost of living is the key issue for Healey and other elected leaders, according to MassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela. He said more people think Massachusetts is headed in the right direction than not, but he sees some consistent concerns show up in his organization’s surveys. “Cost of living is right up there,” Koczela said. “It’s expressed in different ways. It's the cost of health care, it's inflation, it's the cost of living in general. All of those kind of tie back to the same thing.""This aligns with voter sentiment in a UMass Amherst poll in Massachusetts at the tail end of the 2022 campaign, in which people said they wanted the next governor to address inflation as well as the supply and affordability of housing. Tatishe Nteta, a UMass Amherst political science professor and director of the UMass poll, said this is a time when new governors typically seek to harness their public support to make progress on their major goals.“This is where leaders step up and articulate their vision for the future of the state, and the question is, is she going to do that or is it just going to be reactive to the problems that we have been dealing with, whether that’s the MBTA or issues of housing, the overarching issues or transportation and economic issues,” Nteta said. “Is she going to be proactive and visionary? Or is she just going to be reactive and managerial?”The actions Healey and her team take next will reverberate statewide, but they’ll feel different depending on where you are. Transportation needs differ in North Adams and Boston; the housing markets aren’t the same in Provincetown and Springfield. Follow our stories for the next several weeks and learn more as we work with reporters across the state to take a closer look at what the people of Massachusetts have to say about Gov. Maura Healey’s first agenda.SeparatorGBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

928,Dread clearing out that poison ivy? Time to bring in the goats.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/16/dread-clearing-out-that-poison-ivy-time-to-bring-in-the-goats,"The age-old practice of ""goat scaping"" is seen as a preferred alternative to pesticides, especially in areas with sensitive water aquifers.","The pastures and barns of Great Rock Farm on Boston’s North Shore have long been home to horses, sheep, ewes and herding dogs. But in recent years, it’s the farm’s goats who have stepped into the limelight as part of an agricultural trend emerging across New England.“In the early 2000s, we started going goat crazy,” said Michelle Aulson, who owns the farm in Georgetown with more than 200 animals. “Black brush and poison ivy control with all the goats.”Eventually, she said, the farm’s goat enthusiasm evolved into a business, Goats To Go. Known as “goat scaping,” it’s a way of managing vegetation that dates back thousands of years. Particularly for areas in Massachusetts where the ecosystems are more fragile, using goats instead of chemicals lets property owners remove invasive vegetation without harming the environment. And for the people who run the farms, they say they can’t keep up with the interest in renting out their goats. “There’s so many problems with pesticide usage and other things, and it’s a natural way of getting rid of vegetation,” Aulson said. “And it’s also fun to watch them do it.”Aulson transports her goats to cemeteries, parks and schools to clear brush. “Here in the Northeast, you've got urban settings. We've done a lot of dog parks. We've done ... a National Park service in Lowell. We've gone out there on their hillsides to maintain their vegetation.”According to the USDA’s most recent census figures, Massachusetts is home to 670 goat and sheep farms with $2.3 million in yearly sales.John Bennett, who bears the title of “chief goat officer” at Goats of Dover, started his business with three goats during the pandemic after he was laid off from his advertising job. He offers “cocktails with goats” and Zoom meetings with goats, too, but today, his company’s primary service is goat scaping.“And goats, thankfully, love most of the invasive species out there: dense, woody material like poison ivy, bittersweet and buckthorn and things like that,” Bennett said. “One of the main reasons we started is concern over the environment — and the fact that this is what goats were basically born to do is eat stuff like this, right? So why not put their talent to use in a way that's good for the goat and good for the environment.”Since 2015, Stacey Greaves has owned Goat Green Cape Cod, and she rents out her goats for landscape management. Given Cape Cod’s sensitive water aquifer, she says goat grazing is a smart way to approach landscape maintenance.There’s a lot of demand for her services; last year, she was staring down a waiting list of more than 50 potential customers, she said. But she’s hit a hurdle in growing her business: hiring more workers. Greaves says it’s difficult to find employees who are willing to take on part-time, seasonal work. “We need to start taking care of the land. And I just introduced the idea on the Cape,” Greaves said. “There's many, many goat scaping companies across the country, across the world. But it was new here to Cape Cod.” Landscape designer Laura Kelley of Littlefield Landscapes in North Eastham is familiar with environmentally sensitive areas like Cape Cod. “Goats are an incredible method and all-natural way to maintain our properties, and in a way that does not include any sort of toxic chemicals. And so, it's an absolute great way to have animals eat your problems away,” Kelley said. At the Carroll School in Lincoln, Wayland and Waltham, the grounds sometimes battle invasive species, like poison ivy and Japanese knot wood. Danielle Pedreira, the school’s facilities and capital projects director, has hired Goats To Go for years because the Waltham campus abuts wetlands and the reservoir that holds Cambridge’s drinking water. “And because we're in that buffer zone of the wetlands, we can't use any sort of chemicals or tools to try and remove the poison ivy or treat it,” Pedreira said. The goats themselves are pretty low maintenance, their farmers say. Bennett, with Goats of Dover, said the first step on a new job is to assess the property. While the goats aren’t picky eaters, there are a few plants they cannot eat, like rhododendron and milkweed, both of which can cause the animals harm.“We’ll do a site survey where we really walk every square foot of the land that the goats are going to be on to identify any harmful plants and to take measurements and things like that,” Bennett said. “Then we provide an estimate.”The cost can vary, depending on the size of the area and how long it takes the goats to clear the land. Different farmers said it could cost as little as $1,200 for a small penned-in area, while another started at $2,200 for a quarter acre. It may be more costly than pesticides but, to some, it’s worth it to use a more sustainable practice.After the assessment, the goat scaping company will erect a fence around the area where the goats will munch for a few days — up to a couple of weeks for a big job like a national park. Although goat scaping isn't always a permanent fix, farmers like Aulson say the animals come pretty close to controlling regrowth of invasive species the natural way.“They do fertilize,” said Aulson, who runs Great Rock Farm. “But the fertilization with a goat ... they don't re-germinate, which means their stomachs break down everything that's in there. And therefore when they poop out the other end, they're not re-seeding everything.” She said the region’s goat farmers help one another, too. Her farm helps others get into the business of goat scaping by running workshops, too, to teach farmers about the vegetation to keep an eye out for and the equipment that they’ll need — even selling them goats. “We are always trying to help other people get business,” she said. “We know the model.”Goat scaping isn’t a practice that’s regulated at the state level, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. Bennett says the rules with goat scaping vary by community, but he says he doesn’t run into problems with his farming practices. “Neighbors can’t complain about odor or noise as long as you’re doing things that you’re supposed to do,” Bennett said. “They love it. I mean, there's not a lot of things that are cuter than baby goats, believe me.”",Local,"Tue, 16 May 2023 05:00:05 EST",ebbe3f6e8d025feca62d18e5a59fdc3b
3810,Minority-owned firms see big jump in Massachusetts state contracts,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/04/minority-owned-firms-see-big-jump-in-massachusetts-state-contracts,The state's move to empower its Supplier Diversity Office appears to be showing dividends.,"Minority-owned businesses won contracts worth $217 million from Massachusetts state agencies last year, a jump of more than $50 million from the year before, according to new data from the state’s Supplier Diversity Office.The data in a new annual report covering fiscal year 2022 — which ended last June — also shows that minority-owned firms received another $133 million in subcontracting and other ancillary work from white contractors working on state projects. That brings the minority business total to $350 million for the year, or about 5.4% of state contracts. The increase comes as the state made a number of changes to the agency tasked with supplier diversity, giving it more teeth to enforce the commonwealth's goals and creating more tools for agencies to see their own progress. Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday touted the increase and told GBH News that her administration is ""committed"" to doing more. ""Massachusetts is home to so many incredible, diverse businesses that are the backbone of our communities and economy. We are glad that Massachusetts exceeded our goals for supplier diversity last year, with more minority-owned firms winning state contracts than ever before,"" Healey said in a prepared statement. ""Our administration is committed to building on this progress.""Whether or not the state met its goals depends on what contracts are counted. Gov. Charlie Baker's administration had set a goal for state agencies to hire minority-owned firms for 8% of their contract work. Similar to previous years, the Supplier Diversity Office report indicates that the agencies met that goal, because the report includes more than $230 million the state spent with nonprofits led by predominantly minority board members. But in 2021, GBH News surveyed a dozen other states and found only one — Connecticut — that included payments to nonprofits in its annual count of minority contracting totals. The survey was part of an ongoing GBH News investigation, launched in 2020, called The Color of Public Money. Among other findings, the series showed that the value of government contracts won by minority-owned firms in Massachusetts had declined over the past two decades, and that the state had begun counting other expenditures unrelated to state contracts that obscured the shortfall. Substantial changes came in November 2020 when Baker announced that he was elevating the Supplier Diversity Office into a standalone agency, giving it new authority and resources to force other state agencies to meet contracting goals. The change also created a new reporting system that distinguishes nonprofit spending from contracts with private businesses.The new office has allowed for much greater transparency around what the state has achieved. More detailed breakdowns reveal that Black businesses have benefitted more than other groups from the state’s new effort to work with diverse contractors — an effort motivated partly by the racial reckoning that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd.For example, in fiscal year 2020, Black-owned businesses won only $11 million in state contracts. Last year, that number rose to $76 million. Hispanic-owned firms saw their share of state contracts rise from $12 million in 2020 to $28 million last year. For Asian American firms, the total rose from $71 million in 2020 to $110 million last year.Reorganizing the Supplier Diversity Office also led to the creation of a compliance unit that would check and confirm statewide contractors’ claims that they had partnered with diverse firms. Companies getting state contracts are generally directed to meet goals for including minority-owned partners in the work, and they are required to submit reports on their spending. The office said that about one-third of the reports they examined were incorrect, but half of those errors were understating the amount spent with a minority partner, while the other half overstated it. The final totals included in the annual report reflect the corrected amounts. The state also launched a new online portal where agencies can track their own progress — and their contractors' progress — toward meeting the minority inclusion goals, and connect with certified minority-owned firms that are available to take on work.Nicole Obi, president and chief executive of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, said her group will be closely monitoring the state's effort. The council was a leading advocate of Baker's 2020 strengthening of the Supplier Diversity Office.""While we are pleased that there has been some progress, there is still a significant amount of improvement to be made in eliminating barriers and ensuring that the state is held accountable for realizing its procurement goals with Black and other diverse businesses,"" Obi said. ""Without transparency on goal-setting and accountability for implementing the necessary changes, the commonwealth will continue to fall short on equitable procurement."" Peter Hurst, who heads the Greater New England Minority Supplier Development Council, agreed new data shows a ""positive trend."" But he too wants to see more improvements. Part of the problem, he says, is that it's not the Supplier Diversity Office who makes the final procurement decision. Those choices lie with the individual state agencies. ""If you really want to see those numbers improved dramatically so that you're exceeding the goal instead of chasing the goal, what you need to do is push down accountability to the person who's actually making that procurement decision.""Hurst said that some of the work involves a change of mindset. He said people generally think of minority-owned businesses as small companies with limited capacity to fulfill large contracts. But in Massachusetts, he said, there are numerous minority-owned businesses with significant revenues and the capacity to not only fulfill government contracts, but also to mentor smaller firms. He said his council has identified about 150 minority businesses that, together, take in $1.6 billion in revenue. Helping minority-owned businesses grow is not just an ethical imperative, Hurst said, but it is also the key to economic growth statewide.""If you can do anything to help reduce the racial wealth gap by supporting minority business development, it inures to the benefit of everyone in the state — Black, white, brown, rich, poor. You know, it makes the economy stronger,"" he said. ""Anything that makes the economy stronger, we all should be supporting.""",Local,"Thu, 04 May 2023 05:00:50 EST",b634fdf1bea8d1a732f50ae026112502
677,'The Super Bowl of internet law': Local expert weighs in on Supreme Court Section 230 cases,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/23/the-super-bowl-of-internet-law-local-expert-weighs-in-on-supreme-court-section-230-cases,"“We could end up with an internet that is very, very different than what we’ve seen.”","Big tech was on Capitol Hill this week defending itself from allegations that the platforms helped aid and abet terrorism through their algorithms. Google and Twitter are shielding themselves behind the statute known as Section 230, or the Communications Decency Act of 1996. This landmark law, which came to be while the internet was still in its infancy, basically lets the social media platforms off the hook for what its users say online. Section 230 critics argue it allows tech companies to propagate harmful content that could incite violence, as it did for Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed by ISIS terrorists in 2015. Section 230 supporters say repealing it would threaten free speech as we know it, while hampering the creativity and innovation that comes from diverse online communities and platforms. It's hard to believe that the fate of a 26-word statute could upend the future of the Internet. UMass Amherst Professor of Public Policy Communication and Information Ethan Zuckerman sat down with All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss what he calls the ""Super Bowl of internet law."" The following is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: Section 230 almost has as much history as the Super Bowl. So frame this for us, because people talk about this law or this statute going back to 1996 as being responsible for the internet as we know it. Is that an overstatement? Ethan Zuckerman: It's not an overstatement. Let me set this up for you. As the early internet is coming into focus, there's a really interesting question about how we should think about internet service providers — big internet companies that are hosting lots and lots of users. One of those companies, CompuServe, get sued in 1991, and someone essentially says, ""Hey, someone posted a comment on CompuServe. It was defamatory. CompuServe, you're responsible for it."" And in that case, Cubby v. CompuServe, the court found that no, CompuServe is not the publisher. CompuServe is more like a digital library. Then in 1995, someone took Prodigy, which was another one of these online platforms, to court. Same basic circumstance: someone is defaming someone on the message boards. Because you are doing moderation on these message boards because you're taking down some content, you are, therefore, a publisher. And in that case, the New York Court does find that Prodigy is more analogous to a book publisher than to a library or a bookstore. And so this comes in front of Congress in 1996. The idea behind it, the reason this is part of something called the Communications Decency Act, is that the web is very, very new in 1996. People are really concerned about the spread of adult content. What Congress wants to do is allow companies to take down content that violates their terms of service. So they end up saying, ""If you are taking these steps to edit your communities — if you are cleaning them up, if you are moderating them — you are not going to be liable for the users' speech."" That happens in '96. Most of the Communications Decency Act gets overturned. So this is the one sort of surviving little bit of a piece of legislation that was found unconstitutional. It survives because so much of the contemporary Internet is really hard to imagine happening without this shield. Rath: Tell us about how yesterday's case went. It seemed like the justices were pretty skeptical of the takes to take away the shield of Section 230.Zuckerman: Well, following the Super Bowl metaphor, we've really had sort of two halves. We had an argument in a case called Gonzalez v. Google, and then yesterday, we had an argument in Twitter v. Taamneh. In both cases, what's happening is the petitioner is arguing that a big internet platform — YouTube, in one case, and Twitter, in the other — failed to take steps to prevent ISIS from putting content online. In that Gonzalez v. Google case, the argument is that YouTube's algorithms end up recommending ISIS content, and therefore YouTube is at least partially liable for an ISIS attack that killed Nohemi Gonzalez. In Twitter v. Taamneh, it's a slightly less direct case. It's really more making the argument that Twitter might bear liability for ISIS' actions in the same way that a bank that's engaged with terrorist financing might be liable. Somehow, Twitter is making it possible for ISIS to recruit on its platform, and by contributing to ISIS being able to reach a larger audience, Twitter might share the responsibility for an attack — in that case, in Istanbul, Turkey, that killed the client. So in both cases, what people are trying to do is say, ""These platforms have to take some liability, not just for the content that's on the platforms, but in particular for recommending that content"" — for putting it in front of users and making what seems like it might be an editorial choice. But, as has become very, very clear, almost every web platform that hosts lots of user content uses some sort of algorithms to deal with the enormous explosion of content, the huge amount of information that's out there. If we argue that YouTube is liable for recommending some of these videos, where does that liability stop? Does a search engine become liable for giving you information that you have searched for? If we find that in that case, the internet as we know it is going to change quite radically. Rath: Sitting judges on the Supreme Court may not be the most tech-savvy. Are they the appropriate group of people to weigh in on a statue like this that's as complicated as you've laid out? Zuckerman: Well, Elena Kagan actually made that point — that the nine justices were not, in fact, the most tech-savvy group and got a good laugh from all involved. I have to say, from what I've heard in the hearings and what I've read from fellow commentators in the space, I think the petitioners came up as weaker than expected, and I think the Supreme Court came up as more nuanced than I expected. The questions that got asked were actually pretty good. It's one of those moments where you could hear the Supreme Court ask the lawyers presenting in front of them for a possible solution. What happens when a technology platform is promoting COVID-19 misinformation? What happens, as is in these cases, when tech platforms are promoting terrorist information? Are these platforms, in fact, fair in terms of ideological bias on these things? So we see this happening at the Supreme Court rather than happening at the legislative level, which is perhaps where it'd be more appropriate for it to be happening. Rath: If the court, say, rules against the tech companies here and say, ""You know what, you're not protected by this,"" does that mean that the big companies have to staff up with a lot more content moderators and have a lot more legal bills, and the smaller sites maybe go out of business?Zuckerman: Well, Google's counsel made basically that argument. Google basically said, ""Look, without Section 230, the internet is going to go in two different directions. You're going to have some platforms that are essentially a toxic swamp. They're going to be wholly unmoderated because the danger of moderation will end up being so high. If being involved with moderating and recommending means that you're a publisher, some people will run platforms that have absolutely no moderation. There will also be a set of platforms that are likely to be very heavily edited. Things will be as carefully chosen as stories in a magazine or a newspaper because there will be the possibility of lawsuits associated with it."" Brett Kavanaugh, I believe, suggested that this is going to be a lawsuit machine, but we could end up with an internet that is very, very different than what we've seen.",National,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 18:01:09 EST",d7255e0b61e2ca960d2d9dd8f3955734
5061,Should students on the Boston School Committee be allowed to vote?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/02/23/should-students-on-the-boston-school-committee-be-allowed-to-vote,An under-the-radar aspect of the school committee scuffle.,"By now you’ve heard that Mayor Michelle Wu vetoed the proposal to restore an elected school committee and reverse Boston’s position as an outlier with the only mayor-appointed school committee in the commonwealth. What you may not know: She recently signed a separate piece of legislation that would make Boston an outlier in a new, different way by giving voting power to the school committee’s student representatives. The Boston School Committee currently has one non-voting student representative. The measure now headed to the statehouse would add spots for two voting student representatives and an alternate. The Boston Student Advisory Council would elect the positions.It’s an under-the-radar aspect of the school committee scuffle, but one that those at the intersection of youth and civic engagement say could have far-reaching implications if it clears the now daunting Beacon Hill process. Currently, Boston School Committee student reps — those that represent the interests of stakeholders with the greatest interest in Boston Public Schools — lack a say in the policies and decisions that directly impact BPS’ 49,000 or so students.Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director at the Tufts-based, nonpartisan Center for Information Research & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), says that’s an issue.“Student voice is essential. ... Young people have the most immediate, current and deepest knowledge about what's happening in their own classroom and in their curriculum. And nobody else can comment about what the actual student experiences are,” she told GBH News. “It's the kind of expertise the school board needs to be able to make decisions together with young people that actually reflect student views, experience and opinions.” Advocates like Kawashima-Ginsberg see student suffrage as a preferred way to promote civic engagement and do it while the youth are still in school, able to engage with their peers as well as adults.But Glenn Koocher, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, said Boston could be “opening up a can of worms” by allowing students to have a vote because of their stakeholder status. “Then the union president is going to want to vote, then the special education PAC is going to want to vote, and everybody is going to have a legitimate claim to demanding a voice at the table,” Koocher told GBH News. “So at some point you've got to default to the traditional rules of democracy and say if you're elected, you get a seat at the table and a vote.” In addition to the slippery stakeholder slope, Koocher said there’s “a legitimate question regarding how students become fully and responsibly aware of their obligations to think critically and fairly.” To be clear, the Massachusetts Association of School Committees generally abstains from taking sides on school committee governance questions in honor of local control.“We support the right of the community to make its own decision about how to elect its local elected officials,” Koocher said. “So whatever Boston determines is for Boston and not for us” to determine.The Boston School Committee, through a BPS communications official, declined to comment. The matter now moves to the Legislature, which, as it often does, will determine what Boston can and cannot do.SeparatorThis story first ran in GBH News’ politics newsletter.

The 23-year-old had been stationed in South Korea, but had recently been held in a prison there on charges of assault, the AP reported. While it is unclear how long he'd been incarcerated, according to CBS News, King was released to U.S. officials at the military hub in the country about a week ago. Before bolting into North Korea, King was being escorted to an airport outside of Seoul where he was expected to board a plane bound for Fort Bliss, Texas, to face military disciplinary action. Officials got him through airport security, but somehow King managed to ditch the escort and make his way out of the terminal and back to the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. That is where officials said King, who was dressed in civilian clothes, joined a tour of the Korean border village of Panmunjom.One member of the tour group described the incident on a now-deleted Facebook post, saying the King cried out, then ran between two buildings and eventually into North Korea. It is unclear if he planned to defect. Where is Travis King now?During a Tuesday press conference, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said officials believe King is in the custody of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""I'm absolutely foremost concerned about the welfare of our troop,"" Austin said.So far, there has been no official word from North Korea. King's mother, Claudine Gates who lives in Racine, Wis., told ABC News that she was shocked when Army officials told her on Tuesday that her son had fled. ""I can't see Travis doing anything like that,"" Gates said.She added that the last time she heard from her son was a few days ago when he called to tell her he was headed back to his base in Fort Bliss, according to the outlet. ""I'm so proud of him. I just want him to come home, come back to America,"" Gates said. Meanwhile, it is still unclear whether King planned his escape into North Korea or whether it was something he did on a whim. Some experts say that the trip just to the Demilitarized Zone takes days of planning.Jacco Zwetsloot, the host of the North Korea News podcast and a former employee of a tour company that took U.S. soldiers to the border, told the BBC that there was ""no way this person could escape from the airport one day and book on to one of these tours the next.""He told the outlet that these trips usually take three days to plan and tour-goers must submit their passports and other credentials to authorities.Can U.S. officials bring King home? The soldier's detention poses a fresh diplomatic challenge for Washington's wary relationship with North Korea; the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. NPR's Greg Myre said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may endeavor to leverage the incident for political gain.""It certainly wouldn't be surprising if North Korea tries to score some propaganda points or makes demands in exchange for handing over the soldier,"" Myre told All Things Considered. Many U.S. citizens have been detained by North Korea over the years. The last time was in 2018 when Bruce Byron Lowrance​ illegally entered the country from China. Lowrance was held in custody for a month before his release.Before that, Tony Kim, a Korean-American professor, and Kim Hack Song, a former South Korean politician who also held U.S. citizenship, were both detained in 2017 and then released over a year later. Their release came on the same day as another American Kim Dong Chul, who had been held since 2015. The three were set free during a visit North Korea by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and ahead of the much anticipated summit between then-President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore later that year.One of the more high-profile detainments was that of Otto Warmbier in 2016, a U.S. college student who was on a tour of the country before he was detained. Warmbier was accused of taking a poster from his hotel and held for more than a year. He was eventually released to U.S. officials while he was in a coma and then died just days after returning to the U.S.NPR's Emily Olson contributed to this story.

4113,"Analysis: The Celtics gave their all, but could not beat the Heat",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/30/analysis-the-celtics-gave-their-all-but-could-not-beat-the-heat,The Celtics' season has come to a heart-wrenching end.,"The Celtics' season came to a heart-wrenching end after losing game seven of the Eastern Conference finals to the Miami Heat last night at the Garden, 132-84. And with that, so did the C's chances of making history as the first team in the NBA to win a series after being down three games to nothing. GBH's Esteban Bustillos was at the game and joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about it on Tuesday morning. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So first off, before we get into everything that went wrong, there were quite a few celebrity sightings last night. There were a bunch of former Celtics. Esteban Bustillos: Yeah, there were. Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, I think I saw a couple more. Paris Alston: Trying to bring some of that '08 championship magic into the building. Bustillos: For as big of the comparisons about the '04 Red Sox were, there were not as many as I thought. They had Kevin Millar on video, I don't know if he was there in person. So that that was a little odd.Siegel: I also saw Donnie Wahlberg was there, 21 Savage, Aly Raisman, the Olympic gymnast. Before we do get into the game itself, being there in the company of all of these people, what was it like inside of the Garden, before things even got started?Bustillos: The energy was high. The energy was super high. As I mentioned about the '04 Red Sox comparisons, pre-game they had a hype video with a montage of some of the best moments from the '04 ALCS. Paul Pierce was just on the court, just impromptu hyping the crowd up. I mean, this was 30 minutes before the game. The whole place was hyped and then the game started. Alston: And what happened from there? Bustillos: It was really just the first possession. Jayson Tatum went up for a layup, drew contact with Miami's Gabe Vincent. He came down on his foot. Now, anyone who knows, who's ever played basketball, knows that when your foot lands on their player's foot, that's it. That's a graveyard for healthy ankles. And he just immediately was down in pain. There was a nervous murmur that spread throughout TD Garden. He did a pretty good job, I would say, of disguising that pain, but he just wasn't himself for the rest of the night. And Boston's groove was thrown off. Afterwards, Tatum walked with a limp in the press room. Jayson Tatum [previously recorded]: It, you know, kind of impacted me. The rest of the night it swelled up and it was just frustrating. And I was kind of like a shell of myself. It's tough to move. Siegel: So I didn't stay up to watch the game because Paris and I are on the air super early here. Paris actually did watch, which maybe she's regretting. So I've heard a little bit about this game. I mean, I know losing Tatum was big, but Boston only trailed by ten going into the fourth quarter. So what happened there? Bustillos: Yeah. So given the situation they were in with their best player essentially playing on one leg, Boston did a pretty good job of putting up a fight through three quarters. They actually outscored Miami 25-to-24 in that third quarter. The start of the fourth, though, Miami went on a 7-0 run, Boston was down 17, and that's just too hard of a hole to come out of. Boston, they played in hot spurts throughout the game, but Miami consistently hit shots, especially from three-point range, where they were 14 of 28, the Celtics were 9 of 42 from three. Boston would sometimes rush shots, they would look flustered on offense, and the offense just wasn't there. Jaylen Brown, who we're going to talk about a lot, he was 8 of 23 from the field for just 19 points and he just had a bad night when Boston needed him the most with Jayson Tatum, basically, again, just playing on one foot. Jaylen Brown [previously recorded]: You know, my team turned to me to make plays and etc., and I came up short. I failed. And it's tough. You know, I give credit to Miami, but just a terrible job. Alston: So there's no question here that the Celtics lost a key link in the chain with Jayson Tatum and the ankle injury. And I think there's a lot of speculation about how if only that hadn't happened. But at the same time, we've got to remember that Boston was clawing itself out of a 3-0 hole running into this game. So you're having to give 110% for four games in a row. So how much of this is that part of it? Bustillos: I mean, it's definitely part of it, right? There's a reason the Celtics were only the fourth team in NBA history to even be in that position, coming down from 3-0 to tie up the series. But, you know, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have to be perfect or where your health has to be perfect, to when you want to give yourself a little bit of room for error. And being 3-0, there is no more room for error. Al Horford said that they kind of had to play with desperation in the series after falling down the way they did. Al Horford [previously recorded]: There's a lot that goes into it physically, emotionally. There's a lot that goes into it and you get to this point and you still have to play another game. You still have to win another game. And trust me, every guy in the locker room, we wanted it really, really bad. And, you know, it's tough. But as hard as it is, you know, we have to learn from this. Siegel: Let's talk a little bit about learning from this, because going into the season, the C's were favored by a lot of people to make another run at the championship after getting to the finals last year. Where do they go from here? Bustillos: I think one of the big questions is what do they do with Jaylen Brown? He's going to be owed a supermax contract because he made an All-NBA team that would be up to $295 million. That's a lot of money. Will the Celtics want to pay that? Will they want to trade him? For people who want to trade him, my question would be, are you really ready to break up one of the best duos in the NBA with Tatum and Brown over the course of these past few years, even with how his season, especially at the end, went? Alston: So lastly here, Esteban, we've got to talk about Joe Mazzulla, because he obviously was the coach here. But he was sort of thrown into this position because of what happened with former coach Ime Udoka. And I think there's been a lot of questions about whether he rose to the occasion.Bustillos: I would say there is that question, are they going to keep him? My question would be, again, to your point, he's learned a lot. He was put in a bad position. Can he learn from these mistakes going forward? And if you go and get a new coach, is that going to fix all your problems? That would be the fourth coach for the Celtics in four years. That's just not something that most franchises that are looking to win a championship would do. They need to find some consistency. Siegel: Esteban, before we officially say goodbye, Nuggets or Heat?Bustillos: Nuggets in six.Alston: And get some dipping sauce.",Local,"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:47:22 EST",773b1ce4b7ae4ac6e3cc32fa6fb8e1cd

He also said the FTA would meet with T higher-ups ""to identify and distinguish between the immediate actions that will be reviewed, approved, and tracked from the longer-term actions that MBTA may take.""DeLorenzo warned that if the MBTA fails to ""appropriately revise"" its insufficient work plan and comply with other requirements that federal safety officials outlined, the T will be prohibited from right-of-way access.CBS Boston first reported Monday about the FTA's latest letter.The FTA, which mandated a range of safety fixes at the T after an investigation last summer, in April flagged a series of ""near misses"" between subway trains and workers and ordered the transit agencies to improve employee safety.MBTA spokesperson Lisa Battiston said Tuesday that the agency's first submission for an action plan to address right-of-way safety hazards ""included both immediate and longer term actions to complete.""""The FTA has directed the MBTA to focus the workplan on the immediate actions only,"" Battiston said.Battiston also pointed to ongoing efforts to expand the T workforce, a months-long effort that plays a critical role in both safety and service issues.""The MBTA continues to also actively recruit for a number of positions in the Safety Department, and has briefed the FTA on a monthly basis on the status of department staffing,"" Battiston said. ""The Safety Department continues to work closely with the Human Resources Department and a number of local universities with Safety programs to recruit qualified and talented candidates, among other hiring initiatives.""Building out the MBTA's workforce has been a frequently cited focus of Gov. Maura Healey and Eng, whom she installed as GM, but the hiring campaign has stumbled so far and remains well below the pace needed to achieve targets.On the same day the FTA rejected the T's proposed right-of-way response, the federal agency also gave MBTA officials more time to improve internal safety monitoring tools and procedures as required by the 2022 investigation.DeLorenzo approved the MBTA's request to restructure its response to one of the special directives, granting the T until Aug. 10 to resubmit a revised corrective action plan dealing with safety management systems and risk assessments. He wrote in a letter that the FTA's oversight ""confirms the need to reassess actionable items and timelines to develop a more deliberate and targeted approach.""In that same document, federal safety officials aired concerns that the MBTA's safety department remains shorthanded. The FTA ordered the T to complete a staffing analysis of that office by June 25 and then develop ""an urgent hiring plan and strategy.""""MBTA must expedite action to staff the Safety Department, including detailees and embedded contractors, if necessary, and conduct weekly staffing updates with FTA,"" DeLorenzo wrote. ""We believe this focus on safety staffing will help alleviate the capacity challenges the MBTA is facing and enable the agency to better to address the safety issues identified in the Safety Management Inspection (SMI) and implement Safety Management Systems.""In addition to appointing Eng and replacing members of the MBTA's Board of Directors, Healey also tapped Patrick Lavin — who in 2019 contributed to an independent report slamming safety issues at the T — to a newly created role as the Department of Transportation's chief safety officer.",Politics,"Tue, 30 May 2023 16:06:15 EST",29c50165e5b677eb9cea92c775c29fe9

At least that’s the argument made by the co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Transportation. A committee report found 57 safety failures at the T that were not connected to a lack of funding. Instead, “these were oversight management problems of a historic nature that has plagued this system,” Rep. Bill Straus told Boston Public Radio on Monday. Yet, Straus and his co-chair, State Sen. Brendan Crighton, also said that a well-funded T is key to its success. In response to the safety concerns and directives from the Federal Transit Administration, the legislature provided close to $400 million to meet the FTA’s requirements and another $400 million for authorization. “When we have a willing partner that's there to say we need these resources, we've delivered,” said Crighton. Straus doesn’t think current funding is sufficient, even though the MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng said at an oversight hearing a few weeks ago that the T had enough funds to operate and meet safety requirements. “My concern is that while we significantly added to transportation and education …with the millionaire's tax, frankly, the $500 million a year that will come this new fiscal year to transportation is not enough when you consider that the capital needs at the T are in the area of $9 billion,” said Straus. The millionaire’s tax was approved by voters last fall and puts a 4% surtax on the portion of an individual's income over $1 million to fund education and transportation. Despite an influx in funds from the millionaire’s tax, the state is expected to see a decline in gas tax revenue with the rise in electric vehicles. Plus, Crighton said it’s difficult to raise transportation revenue at the legislative level because there are 200 members with various needs for their districts.To help relieve costs and address structural challenges, Straus advocates for shifting some MBTA responsibilities to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The T would focus on its core mission, which Straus said is to provide safe, reliable and predictable delivery of buses and subways. And commuter rail management would be shifted to MassDOT. “Let's have a T that focuses on what is its core metro area mission,” Straus said. During the live radio discussion, former transportation secretary Jim Aloisi (a frequent BPR contributor) tweeted against this idea. ""Allow me to point out that moving intercity rail from the T to MassDOT is solving a problem that doesn’t exist. Riders need a connected regional transit network,"" the tweet said. Another headline that’s been leading transportation news for several weeks is the Sumner Tunnel closure. As for the expected delays, Crighton said it's been better than anticipated. “I have to tip my cap to the governor and the administration,” he said. Gov. Healey’s administration approved alternative options for commuters going to and from the North Shore, like a ferry from Lynn, free fares on the Blue Line and reduced commuter rail parking fees at the Wonderland stop. Crighton said he’s happy to see the success of the Lynn ferry. “We have people turned away every day. I don't want them turned away, but I'm glad to see public transit is now being used. And maybe this is something that should be continuing in the future along all three of those modes,” Crighton said.",Local,"Mon, 17 Jul 2023 16:34:41 EST",434db2aa90858ad1ecc9c7babb2e5cca
7224,AG's office posts record number of housing related complaints in 2022,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/15/ags-office-posts-record-number-of-housing-related-complaints-in-2022,For the first time housing complaints surpassed those against used car dealers in the state.,"More tenants are taking their concerns over disputes with landlords to the state than ever before, according to a new consumer report from the state attorney general’s office.The attorney general’s office received more landlord-tenant related complaints than previously recorded, a recent 2022 Consumer Advocacy report published by Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office cited. “This report reaffirms what we already know — that we are in a housing crisis in Massachusetts,” said Campbell in a statement to GBH News, adding that her office is there to help. “My office is committed to creating economic security for residents across Massachusetts by standing up for tenants who are being treated unfairly by landlords, enforcing our housing laws and ensuring that all our residents have access to safe, sanitary and affordable housing.” For the first time, housing complaints surpassed those against used car dealers. The office received 918 consumer complaints about rental housing in 2022, and 171 requests for help through their eviction help request form. Many of those complaints involved unsafe or unsanitary conditions in rental units. Each were reviewed by the Attorney General’s Consumer Advocacy and Response Division, with eviction cases “prioritized” in 2022. They respond by connecting renters with legal services and rental assistance programs, where applicable. The office connects renters with resources but doesn’t typically get money for most landlord-tenant cases, except for some returned security deposits and late fees. For those specific cases, the Consumer Advocacy and Response Division recovered more than $108,000 for 63 people in 2022.In one case, a tenant filed a complaint with the AG’s office over a severe pest problem their landlord had been notified about several times. When the landlord didn’t fix the issue, they broke their lease and moved out, but the landlord didn’t return their $2,400 security deposit. The AG’s Local Consumer Program contacted the landlord and got the tenant their full deposit back. “If your landlord is violating the statute as it pertains to security deposit or whether or not they're like holding on to that money, they don't put it into a separate interest accruing account — if you don't get it back within 30 days — you're actually entitled to treble damages,"" said Mark Martinez, housing staff attorney at Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. He wasn’t surprised to see the growing number of complaints about living conditions.“I think as people are being expected to pay more and more for housing, without the quality of that housing increasing as well, I think people are less and less willing to accept the fact that they're living in unsafe or unsanitary apartments,” Martinez said. The report also outlined upcoming changes to the state sanitary code, including a rule that landlords must inspect for pests before new tenants move in and document that, and that landlords must make a good-faith effort to correct dangerous and unsafe living conditions within 24 hours.Martinez said restitution for poor conditions or repairs, are the types of issues that involve long housing court processes, and are not typically part of the role of an attorney general’s office. That’s where legal aid organizations like his own fill a need. “As that [complaints] increases, I don't think the answer is necessarily the AG continuing to take on a bigger role in housing rather than supporting policies outside of the AG's office that would respond to these issues as well,” said Martinez. Overall in 2022, the AG’s office fielded over 23,000 consumer complaints, which included consumers reaching out about student loan providers, over 900 related to used car sales, and over 630 had issues involving solar power — like delays in connecting rooftop panels, and underperforming solar systems.",Local,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 16:49:16 EST",1884168b5a031f5533124e794e43f9ca
6741,Resident physicians at Boston Medical Center rally for higher wages,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/20/resident-physicians-at-boston-medical-center-rally-for-higher-wages,"The resident physicians at Boston Medical Center are in negotiations for a new contract, with demands for improved wages and benefits.","Hundreds of resident physicians at Boston Medical Center donned white coats in the midday heat for what they called a “unity break” in front of the hospital. “I did not come into medicine in order to fight for the salaries of doctors,” Dr. Brett Lewis, a union delegate and Boston Medical Center resident, told the crowd.“We are doctors at BMC because we care about providing the most equitable, culturally appropriate and evidence-based care possible,” Lewis told GBH News. “But we can't do that when we ourselves are struggling so much.”The rally comes as the physicians seek a new contract with improved wages and benefits. Contract negotiations began three months ago, with the last contract expiring at the end of June. The 750 resident physicians — unionized with the Committee of Interns and Residents — are looking for higher wages and better benefits, arguing that it will create more livable conditions for current employees and help attract a more diverse workforce. Per the union, the first-year salary for resident physicians is under $67,000 — less than Cambridge Health Alliance, Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Mass General Brigham. Medical residents and fellows at Mass General Brigham just voted to unionized this year over their long hours and salaries, which start at $78,540. “Our ask is very simple. Boston Medical Center needs to pay us enough and provide the benefits we need to live and work in one of the most expensive cities in this country,” said Dr. Taha Khan, a resident physician in pediatric neurology. “Like so many BMC residents, I am constantly worried about being able to pay my rent. My bills are for parking at the hospital where I come to work and care for my patients.”Khan said, with a fair contract, the hospital could bring in more doctors of color who mirror the diversity of the hospital’s patients. Psychiatry resident Dr. Anisah Hashmi said the upfront cost of a medical degree can create workforce inequities, too.“That reinforces the model where only the wealthy have access to become doctors,” Hashmi said. “And when we reinforce that model, we do not have doctors that reflect the diverse patient population that we serve.”In an emailed statement to GBH News, Boston Medical Center said it, “greatly values the contribution our residents and fellows make to our hospital. We are actively in conversation with the Committee of Interns and Residents and look forward to, once again, negotiating a mutually agreeable contract.”Medical students, nurses, medical interpreters and teachers — as well as local officials such as City Councilors Ed Flynn, Liz Breadon and Ruthzee Louijeune — came out to support the physicians. “I'm really hopeful about this turnout that we had. It was phenomenal,” Hashmi said. “So I'm optimistic that when we go to the bargaining table tonight, we're going to get a different, better outcome, hopefully.”",Local,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 18:07:28 EST",fa9332eaa0fa74e2bc9d9eed1f17d897

Maura Healey this week, roughly one month after it was supposed to be completed. Their compromise plan totals more than $56 billion and includes: free meals for all public school students, expanded access to the state's subsidized health-insurance program, and $20 million for free community college tuition for older students who lack degrees. The budget also makes undocumented students eligible for in-state tuition and state financial aid, as long as they meet certain requirements. But plenty of other priorities weren't included in the budget, which Healey now has a week to sign or send back with vetoes. Adam Reilly digs into the budget's details and the broader messages it sends with GBH News State House Reporter Katie Lannan, political strategist and Tufts professor Samuel Gebru, and Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance spokesperson Paul Craney.Are you satisfied with the Legislature's budget proposals?

5736,'A lot of bang for your buck' with jail-based arts programs,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/01/a-lot-of-bang-for-your-buck-with-jail-based-arts-programs,Researchers have found a correlation between making art in U.S. jails and prisons and improved mental health.,"On Mondays, Eddie takes a macroeconomics class at 9:00 a.m. Then at 1:00 p.m., he takes a course on statistics and probability. Eddie also studies French, and exercises daily.Eddie has been living in the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield, Massachusetts, since before the pandemic. His sentence is up in about two years, For privacy reasons, he asked that we not use his last name.A large part of his day is spent in a shared cell with a bunk bed, desk, toilet and sink. Many of the courses he takes are virtual, and being allowed to use a tablet in this jail is not automatic. It's an earned privilege.Once a week, in person, Eddie takes guitar lessons.“It gives me something to do,” he said. “And on top of that, music is something that helps a person. They say it enhances our mental capacity and ability.”Eddie is part of an intermediate group lesson and in the past few weeks has focused on the minor pentatonic scales. James — who also asked to keep his identity private — is using a Fender guitar someone donated to the program.""I had been dabbling with a guitar for like probably three years, but it wasn't structured,” James said.That was before getting arrested. James has been at the Franklin County Jail for a year and a half, awaiting sentencing. Playing guitar, he said, helps him keep his mind off things.“I think definitely understanding myself and playing guitar go hand in hand,” James said.He wouldn’t talk about why he was arrested. Neither would Eddie.It’s a topic their guitar teacher Michael Nix, a professional musician, never asks about.“It’s a personal thing they can share with me if they want,” Nix said, “but I really don't care.”What Nix does care about, like any music teacher, is that his students practice and learn. But given the setting, Nix said, it's more than that.“What I care about is forming positive relationships, where as a mentor I can ask people to operate at the same kind of high level that I ask myself to operate at [as a musician],"" Nix said.Nix started teaching guitar at the Franklin County Jail in the months before the pandemic shut down in-person activities. Now he meets with about a dozen students — some are long-term, he said, and some he sees once and they don't return. He doesn't always find out why.Guitar lessons are offered only to people who are locked up in a particular unit of the Franklin County Jail.To be able to stay in the unit, James said you have to step up, volunteer and go to regular community meetings.""We’re held to a higher standard,” he said. ”We gotta do well.”Even with incentives like more free time or extra Netflix, James said not everyone takes advantage of the different courses — or the therapy.Franklin County Sheriff Christopher Donelan said the crimes that bring people to his jail come out of childhood trauma and mental health issues. In the last decade, the opioid epidemic has pushed law enforcement to look at what it means to jail someone with addiction.""The science tells us that addiction is a disease,” Donelan said. “And we're failing ourselves if we think that we can just contain men and women with substance abuse issues in a jail, and then release them and think that anything's going to change or improve.”Not everyone in the U.S. corrections system agrees that men and women convicted of a crime should be able to participate in music lessons or art classes, but Donelan said he thinks most victims of crime are satisfied with the fact that the perpetrator is behind bars.""The bottom line is, as I tell [employees], it's not our job to punish. That's the judge's job,"" Donelan said. ""The judge sends them to us. Our job is to correct behavior and offer opportunities for a better life of not committing crimes.""Researchers have found a correlation between making art in U.S. jails and prisons and social skill development and improved mental health. For people who are incarcerated, corrections officials say that translates to learning how to work out the kinks in social settings — with family and employers, and to longevity in the workplace or staying with their therapy or drug treatment.This progressive approach is used at county jails around Massachusetts, Donelan said. Data from Franklin County, he said, show some promising results.""There was a 27% reduction in recidivism over a three-year cohort from 2015 to 2018,"" Donelan said, looking at the jail's first cohort in its cognitive behavioral therapy program.“Corrections professionals realize that there's a lot of bang for your buck with these programs,” said Wayne Kramer, the founder of the proto-punk band MC5.“If they don't do something to help people change for the better, the prison experience itself will change them for the worse,” Kramer said.Kramer speaks from experience. He was arrested in 1975 for selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent. While he was incarcerated in Kentucky, The Clash wrote a song about Kramer and a few other musicians in their B-side single ""Jail Guitar Doors."" Kramer is mentioned in the first verse.""Let me tell you 'bout Wayne and his deals of cocaineA little more every dayHolding for a friend till the band do wellThen the D.E.A. locked him away...""Twenty or so years after Kramer was released, he and British singer-songwriter Billy Bragg used the song title for starting two organizations — one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., — that get musical instruments into the hands of incarcerated men and women.Kramer's organization, with the motto ""saving lives one guitar at a time,"" is being used in jails and state prisons in California, Arizona, Texas and other states.""We've participated in longitudinal studies where we have empirical evidence that people that participate in arts-in-corrections programing have lower recidivism rates,"" Kramer said.In Los Angeles County Men's Jail, Kramer himself teaches songwriting workshops.""What they learn right away is how to collaborate with someone that they might not normally hang out with,"" Kramer said. ""They might not be from their neighborhood or might not have the same skin color [or] they might speak Spanish.""What inevitably happens, Kramer said, is they find out they have much more in common than different. He's witnessed remarkable connections made between incarcerated men from from rival gangs, Kramer said, because they're playing and writing music together.“I've had guys tell me, ‘Wayne, you know that dude? I never liked him. I'd see him on the yard. I don't like him. But, you know, we worked on that song together and he's all right,’” Kramer said.At the Franklin County Jail, Eddie and others are allowed to keep their guitars with him, even after class.He’s been battling depression for years, he said, and playing helps him. There’s one song he recently learned that soothes him.“Like, I close my eyes, I'm out in the zone somewhere and it just relaxes me almost as a mother, singing to a child,” Eddie said.The song is a lullaby written by Sting, but Eddie first heard it at the end of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.""Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here it's safe, here it's warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.Eddie plays it over and over, he said. He's good enough that no one asks him to stop. It may even be soothing to others who hear him.""The last two or three cell mates that I had, basically I play guitar while they're in there,"" Eddie said. ""And because they're in there, I usually kind of play soft. And strangely, they all end up sleeping where I'm playing.""Nix, the guitar teacher, said when people make music together, it's one of the most healthy social interactions. And being able to learn a piece, he said, is a big self-esteem boost — something that could help them live a better life, once they're out of jail.",Local,"Mon, 01 May 2023 05:00:43 EST",797f063d7c9f11bff88fc398616ad78a
2985,More people are getting away with murder. Unsolved killings reach a record high,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/01/more-people-are-getting-away-with-murder-unsolved-killings-reach-a-record-high,"More murders across America are going unsolved, exacerbating the grief of families already reeling and worsening the largely cracked trust between police and the public, especially communities of color most affected by gun violence.","More murders across America are going unsolved, exacerbating the grief of families already reeling and worsening the largely cracked trust between police and the public, especially communities of color most affected by gun violence. ""I haven't had any word,"" says Mark Legaspi about the murder of his cousin, friend and business partner Artgel Anabo Jr., 39, who was known as Jun. He was shot just outside their popular Filipino fast-food restaurant Lucky Three Seven in East Oakland, Calif., May 18, 2022. ""It's still emotional every day coming in here, you know?"" Legaspi says nodding toward the street where Jun was murdered.Oakland detectives released security camera footage and the license plate number of the suspected get-away car. Anabo's family believes the suspect is a man who sold Anabo a truck that turned out to be stolen. Still, there's been no break in the case and no word. ""It's definitely frustrating. Justice hasn't been served,"" Legaspi says. ""I mean it's almost a year. I would like to know something. I don't get no answers,"" he says noting that he and his family haven't heard from Oakland homicide detectives for months. ""You know, if there's anything, you know, even if they didn't do anything, that'd be nice to know. Instead of us hoping."" The U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized worldLegaspi's frustration and pain are shared by hundreds of families of murder victims in Oakland – and across the country – whose cases remain unsolved. While the rate at which murders are solved or ""cleared"" has been declining for decades, it has now dropped to slightly below 50% in 2020 - a new historic low. And several big cities, including Chicago, have seen the number of murder cases resulting in at least one arrest dip into the low to mid-30% range. ""We saw a sharp drop in the national clearance rate in 2020,"" says Prof. Philip Cook, a public policy researcher and professor emeritus at Duke University and the University of Chicago Urban Labs who has been studying clearance rates for decades. ""It reached close to 50% at that time nationwide, which was the lowest ever recorded by the FBI. And it hasn't come up that much since then.""That makes the U.S. among the worst at solving murders in the industrialized world. Germany, for example, consistently clears well over 90% of its murders. While reasons behind the drop are multi-faceted, Cook and other experts warn that more people getting away with murder in the the U.S. is driving a kind of doom loop of mutual mistrust: low murder clearance rates impede future investigations which in turn potentially drive up killings in some communities where a lack of arrests undermines deterrence and sends a message that the police will not or cannot protect them. ""Communities that are especially impacted by gun violence believe that the police are ineffective or indifferent, and as a result, they're less willing to cooperate and provide information the police need to have successful investigations,"" says Cook, who has several research articles on the topic coming out. ""It is undermining whatever trust there is in the police. And it's a vicious circle,"" Cook says.""I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder""Oakland, Calif., is a prime example of that vicious circle. The city's per capita homicide rate remains abnormally high and its murder solve rate is among the lowest in the nation, hitting just 36% last year. If you take out the handful of older, ""cold"" cases that were solved during 2022, the clearance rate in Oakland just 27%, an analysis by the S.F. Chronicle shows. ""Well, I certainly don't believe in anyone getting away with murder. These cases are never closed,"" says Drennon Lindsey, an Oakland deputy chief who formerly led the department's homicide division. ""We never give up, you know. And I also think we can only get better."" Lindsey says the veterans among her 16 detectives are often handing two dozen or more cases at a time, far above the federal recommendation that detectives carry an average of only four to six new homicide cases per year. In addition, she says, an antiquated case management data system, which the city is working to replace, is another reason behind the painfully low clearance rate. But the biggest one, she says, is too many people are scared to talk with and help the OPD. ""People don't want to cooperate, people don't want to come to court and testify. And they're afraid of retaliation, of being labeled in their communities as a ""snitch."" And we're often left trying to plea and beg for the community to come forward with information to hold this person accountable for committing murder,"" she says. But that mistrust is also bred by the department's chronic dysfunction. The department remains under federal oversight and has for two decades. In that time the troubled agency has gone through a dozen leaders. And recently veteran Oakland homicide detective Phong Tran was arrested and arraigned after the Alameda County district attorney's office accused him of paying a witness thousands of dollars to lie in a murder case that resulted in two men getting life sentences. Detective Tran faces felony charges of perjury and bribery. Those two murder convictions have been tossed out. In a statement to NPR, Tran's attorney Andrew M. Ganz called the charges ""baseless"" and lashed out a District Attorney Pamela Price for treating ""murderers like heroes."" Price's office in a statement says it is now reviewing at least 125 murders Tran investigated ""to see if we have wrongfully convicted anyone else.""""Lying and manipulating a witness are serious violations of the public trust and a threat to the integrity of the judicial system,"" Price says. ""When the integrity of a conviction is at issue in one case, it raises questions in every other case that the detective has investigated.""The ""exceptional means"" clause and chronic police staffing affect murder clearance rates The FBI defines a murder ""cleared"" if a suspect has been identified and arrested. But a murder can also be declared cleared through what's known as an ""exceptional means."" For example, if a suspect is dead, can't be extradited or prosecutors refuse to press charges. So, criminologists note, even some cities now touting modestly improved murder clearance rates, such as Chicago, are really just artificially boosting their clearance numbers through that ""exceptional means"" clause.The arrest rate per murder if is often a better indicator of how police departments are actually doing at holding killers accountable. Prof. Cook's research, for example, shows that from 2016 to 2020 the percentage of murders in Chicago with any type of weapon resulting in at least one arrest was just 33%. And in Durham, North Carolina, between 2017 and 2021 just 41% of gun homicide cases resulted in at least one arrest. Other reasons for the further decline in murder clearance rates, experts say, include chronic police staffing and recruiting problems, and the fact that more murders are committed with firearms, which can result in fewer witnesses and less physical evidence. In addition, judges, prosecutors and juries have higher evidence and procedure standards than in the 1960s when 90-plus% of homicides were listed as solved. Researchers say key ways cities can to try to stop the downward spiral is simply investing more in homicide investigations: improving crime labs, training, DNA testing, computer modeling systems. White crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killingIn front yard of Oakland's Saint Columba Catholic Church along bustling San Pablo Ave, a garden of simple, wooden, white crosses with the names and ages of the dead grows with every killing. Every Jan. 1 ""that garden is a garden for about a minute,"" says Fr. Aidan McAleenan, St Columba's pastor looking at the roughly two dozen crosses already posted in the yard. ""And then is just gets grows and grows"" all year. ""My biggest concern, and I prayed about this, there are about 100 people walking around Oakland now who will not be walking around Oakland at the end of the year,"" McAleenan says. Parishioner Rich Laufenberg makes the wooden crosses and dutifully ""plants"" them every week or two. ""I do it as some kind of service work, I hope, and to let people know that we have a major violence problem here in Oakland,"" he says. Regularly, Laufenberg says when placing the crosses he'll find family or friends of a victim praying or just gazing in stunned silence at the lives cut short""They'll stop and look and strike up a conversation and they mention not infrequently that the relative whose cross they're looking at, that case, hasn't been solved yet."" At Oakland's Lucky Three Seven Filipino restaurant, owner Mark Legaspi says he doesn't blame Oakland detectives, per se, for not solving his cousin's murder. They're overworked and overwhelmed, he says. But he wants answer. And so does his murdered cousin's son, Kiah, now 12 who was super tight with his dad. Kiah was right next to his dad when the gunman attacked. ""He saw everything. I'm just glad he ran the other way instead of following his dad. You know, because he could have got caught in the line of fire,"" Legaspi says. ""Obviously, as a kid, seeing that, your superhero dad, you know, that will always have problem with you know, like inside,"" he says. Anabo's son is doing OK, given the circumstances, he says. He's making the Honor Roll and trying to stay positive. ""Just got to keep that love with him every day, you know.""The family plans to honor Anabo with a gathering at the restaurant on the upcoming May 18 anniversary of his murder. But they'd rather celebrate a break in his case. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 07:00:00 EST",64e82c0ffacf2ea59fdf9d6ce9dbb018

The idea may not be as implausible as it sounds. Evidence is mounting that the four-day week improves employees’ lives while also offering real advantages for companies that adopt it.Now, amid the broader reimagining of work-life balance prompted by the pandemic, some Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing for state government to take an active role in making the four-day work week a reality. Adam Reilly is joined by state Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, who has filed a bill that would require employers to pay overtime after workers tally 32 hours, and Juliet Schor, a Boston College professor who’s been studying and advocating for a four-day work week for years. They discuss the case for dropping that fifth day, the cultural trends that could bolster the case for change, and the political prospects of the aforementioned legislation.Could you do your job in four days instead of five?

6324,Hope shines through in devastating new FRONTLINE documentary on Ukraine invasion,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/13/hope-shines-through-in-devastating-new-frontline-documentary-on-ukraine-invasion,“20 Days in Mariupol” captures violence and destruction in the earliest days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,"In a Mariupol maternity hospital, doctors delivered a baby via cesarean section. But for a long time, the room was silent. Finally, the baby cried. A sign of life in a hospital room that had mostly known death since the start of the war with Russia. “Then everyone started to cry,” Ukrainian journalist Mstyslav Chernov told Boston Public Radio on Thursday. Chernov is a filmmaker and photographer whose new film “20 Days in Mariupol” documented this scene and many others during the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The film, produced in collaboration with FRONTLINE and the Associated Press, debuts this Friday in New York City. On Monday, July 17, a special screening and Q&A at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline will be moderated by GBH president and CEO Susan Goldberg. Before the Russian siege started on Feb. 24, 2022, Chernov said he and his fellow journalists decided they would stay in the southeastern city to record the war. “We knew how important Mariupol would be for Russia to try to take over because they’ve been trying this since 2014,” Chernov said. The team of journalists worked alongside doctors and firefighters working to save people from rubble. “How could we think about leaving? ... Everyone was dedicated to survival and to helping people next to them. We just did our job,” he said. That job was to record violence and tragedies in real time. Having photos and videos is important to document potential war crimes. When there are no journalists, there’s a void in information, Chernov said. He cited the bombing of a theater in Mariupol, where close to 600 people were killed. “It took us months to ... try to reconstruct that event,” he said. The journalists only left the city when they no longer had means to work. When the hospital was occupied by Russian troops and the Red Cross location bombed, they had no place to charge their equipment batteries. The film shows the bodies of people in the streets and injured people in hospitals. Chernov has heard from viewers that his film is hard to watch — but that “these moments of hope are shining through.”“Yes, it is hard, it is heartbreaking,” he said. “But there is hope there, and there is a resilience, a resistance of Ukrainian people who survive nevertheless, regardless of their indiscriminate violence that is happening to them.” Hope comes from moments like the baby born in the middle of a war. Chernov said one of the doctors said to him that day, “We used to see only people dying in this hospital. So having a child born is just like a ray of light coming down from heaven to us.” Yet what’s captured in the film is just a fraction of what Chernov and others witnessed in Mariupol and across Ukraine. “Mariupol is just a tiny fraction of what has happened to Ukraine. Other cities have been destroyed with the same tactics of burned land. ... I still have a lot of regrets for not being able to capture everything,” he said. Aside from taking time to promote “20 Days in Mariupol,” he's been filming on the frontlines every day. “I can see so many things that just couldn’t be reported on — haven’t been reported on — because, well, because it’s just too overwhelming.” The film will eventually be broadcast on PBS and available on streaming services. Chernov said his goal is for as many people to see the film as possible, including his daughters, whom he spends time away from while reporting on the front lines. “They are too little to understand right now what is going on. But someday they will ask me, and I will just show them this film,” he said.",Local,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 16:27:07 EST",ac635cd760c20f6f6336735b9766abce

Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.“We're certainly very different than we were a year ago,” Epstein said. “We were already sort of worried about the lack of rain at that point.”The Blue Hill Observatory has recorded 1.46 inches of rainfall this month through June 12, compared with 1.29 inches for the same time period the year before. “We are still technically below average,” Epstein said. “You're correct that the pattern's been such that there's been a lot of clouds, a couple of showers. But when you add it all up, we're not wet.”Yes, the rain we’re seeing now is connected to the eight inches of snow atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, Epstein said. “Last week, we had overhead cool air over us,” he said. “It wasn't that cool down here, relatively speaking. But up there, that cool pool there up at 6,000 feet was cold enough that they produced some snow.”Blocking patterns are what happens when storm systems moving from west to east slow down, grinding to a crawl. “And now that block, which was last week to our east, is now to our west. So we're on a warmer side of the block, but we're still seeing some showers inside that sort of stuck pattern.” As for the snow on top of Mount Washington: It probably won’t stick around for long. “A lot of that will melt as temperatures warm up,” Epstein said. Sue emailed in some photos, which Epstein reviewed.“The leaves themselves look relatively healthy,” he said. “Sometimes plants lose a little bit of leaf color.”It’s possible that insects or a cold winter snap in February damaged the tree, he said, but he could not make a definite diagnosis through photos alone. “Trees are in our yards are really important,” he said. “If anybody’s concerned about their trees, I suggest calling a certified arborist in your local area. They usually will come out and they'll do a consultation and kind of tell you what's going on with the tree. Oftentimes, that first consultation doesn't even cost you anything. So it's worth [it] to have a true expert come out on property to look at what's going on.”",Local,"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 09:24:41 EST",10a5b1084616791ed537c83376f22d73
4249,Healey's proposed budget a boon to education and the environment,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/healeys-proposed-budget-a-boon-to-education-and-the-environment,Moves to safeguard funds from the 'millionaire's tax'.,"Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday filed a $55.5 billion state budget that proposes a major boost for environmental and energy agencies, locks in tuition rates for Massachusetts students at state universities, and provides free phone calls for people in state prisons. “Today, we wanted to present a budget that will set Massachusetts up for success by lowering costs, growing our economy and delivering on the promise of our people,” Healey said. “Together, we’re putting forth ambitious goals and historic, significant investments.” Healey’s budget for the 2024 fiscal year would increase spending by about 4% over this year’s budget, and it creates a dedicated trust fund for revenue from the state’s new tax on incomes over $1 million. Voters approved that tax at the ballot last November, and the money it generates is dedicated to education and transportation causes. Healey is planning to split $1 billion in millionaire’s tax revenue roughly evenly between education and transportation, with a substantial chunk of it — $360 million — going towards higher education. “Our public higher ed grads, they’re our future teachers and nurses and business owners and accountants and entrepreneurs,” said Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, a Salem State University graduate. “The majority of folks graduating from our public higher ed institutions, they stay right here in the commonwealth.” Healey is proposing to use $59 million of the millionaire’s tax money for what she’s calling “tuition stabilization” in the public higher education system — in-state undergraduates at the UMass campuses and state universities would pay the same tuition rates throughout their four years, rather than facing annual increases. UMass President Marty Meehan said the tuition certainty ""will help our students and their families plan for the cost of a UMass education while encouraging more students to finish their degree in four years, both of which will result in a more affordable degree.""Other goals Healey has in mind for the surtax revenue include reducing waitlists for child care subsidies, expanding early college programs, creating a new grant to help fund municipal transportation projects, and stepping up investments in highway bridge preservation. Healey also wants to steer some of this money to regional transit authorities and to the MBTA, where it will help cover start-up costs for a means-tested fare program to make the T less expensive for people with lower incomes. Healey’s budget also: Requires the Department of Correction to provide up to 1,000 minutes a month of free phone calls, estimated to cost $20 million. Lawmakers advanced no-cost calls legislation last year, but couldn’t get former Gov. Charlie Baker on board.Increases funding for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs by 24%, including money for 240 new staff members. The major funding hike prompted Sen. Mike Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy and Utilities Committee, to call Healey's plan ""the best executive branch budget I've ever seen"" and ""a leap over anything a governor has proposed before."" Includes $324 million for the emergency assistance family shelter program, a 48% increase. The Healey administration says the program is expected to serve 338 new families a month in fiscal 2024. Delivers on a promise she made in her inaugural address by including $20 million to make community college free for eligible students age 25 and older. State financial aid already exists to defray the cost of community college, and Healey’s office says the MassReconnect scholarships “would offer students last-dollar financial support to cover the cost of tuition, fees, books and supplies as well as provide funding for career and wraparound support services to encourage retention and degree completion.” Alongside her budget, Healey also formally filed the $742 million tax-break package she announced Monday and a bill to add a dedicated housing secretary in her cabinet. Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Healey’s budget shows the state remains in a strong financial condition, giving the administration high marks for its tax relief plan, early education investments and what he called a “transparent approach to tracking and using surtax revenue.” The Raise Up Massachusetts Coalition, which campaigned for the surtax, said Healey deserves credit for making sure that money is spent as intended on education and transportation. The coalition has knocked Healey's proposal to reform the estate tax and reduce the tax rate on short-term capital gains, assets held for a year or less. ""While the Governor’s budget proposes several meaningful new initiatives, it doesn't come close to making the investments necessary to address our workforce challenges, tackle our broken childcare system, end the housing affordability crisis, or fix the MBTA and build a 21st century statewide transportation system,"" the coalition said in a statement.Healey’s budget represents a starting point in a process that will stretch for months. The House, in mid-April, will rewrite her plan to reflect its own priorities and add in local earmarks for representatives’ districts. The Senate will follow suit, debating and passing its own budget ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, and the two branches will iron out their differences in closed-door negotiations with the goal of agreeing on a final state budget by the Jul. 1 start of the new fiscal year.For the past several years, talks have dragged past that deadline, and the state has relied on temporary budgets to keep government running.

4300,Boston’s police oversight office has yet to uphold a single civilian complaint,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/bostons-police-oversight-office-has-yet-to-uphold-a-single-civilian-complaint,Experts say it takes time to roll out new systems — and that continued scrutiny is key.,"Nearly two years after its executive director was hired, and roughly one year after it began to operate in earnest, Boston’s Office of Police Accountability and Transparency has yet to sustain any civilian complaints against the Boston Police Department or to issue subsequent recommendations for disciplinary action, according to a review of city data by GBH News. A data dashboard on the office’s website says that in 2022 OPAT, as the office is widely known, received 56 complaints from civilians about the BPD, which employs more than 2,000 officers, and that 21 of those complaints were deemed lacking. But according to a city spokesperson, that doesn’t include more than two dozen complaints that were quickly dismissed upon initial review rather than being sent to OPAT’s Civilian Review Board for deeper consideration. When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending. The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternate mechanism through which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them. As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD. The abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking — especially given the high hopes that accompanied Boston’s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case. Everett, who was appointed as OPAT’s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role. Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.“There are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,” Everett said. “They can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.” For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT’s existence may not be enough.“While we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don’t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,” she said. “I started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it’s also a very hard ask. They don’t know who I am. They don’t know who this agency is. ... We’re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.” OPAT, which was created by a 2020 city ordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD’s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review. Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under the ordinance that created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annual report sent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether. In that same report, Everett said OPAT’s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission — like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder. In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it’s often called, mandated that investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted. “Our department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,” Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement. Gianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected. “It’s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,” Irlando said. “You have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you’re going to have access situations — because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don’t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.” Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it’s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity’s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don’t know or trust a particular oversight agency — or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well. Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who is tracking and analyzing the proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts. “The best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,” Fairley said. “And what’s good about what’s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, ‘OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.’ And then that audience — the public — can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.” Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Board can be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainant claimed they’d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent “audit” of the BPD’s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which they believed officers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights. But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago’s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.“On paper, it looked fantastic,” Fairley said. “It was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have. “You are right to be watchful,” she added. “Because we want to make sure these entities as they’re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they’ve been given over time.”",Politics,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:00:15 EST",aee50f34f54c6b6ea45590bcd8ce7eae
4829,Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says Supreme Court needs an enforceable code of conduct,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-supreme-court-needs-an-enforceable-code-of-conduct,The Rhode Island senator is leading an ethics investigation against Justice Clarence Thomas.,"Earlier this week, the Supreme Court released a statement stating they will continue to oversee their own actions for ethical violations, and maintain control over whether they should recuse themselves from cases with financial interests. The statement was signed by all nine justices. If the justices were treated like any other person involved in a lawsuit, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said “they’d get blown out of court, they’d be laughed at.” “It’s really stunning the people who are at the very height of the legal profession would put forward such a preposterous document,” the senator said Friday on Boston Public Radio. The statement was attached to a letter Chief Justice John Roberts wrote to refuse to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing is in response to criticism of Justice Clarence Thomas’ receiving undisclosed luxury vacations and trips paid for by billionaire Harlan Crow, first reported in an investigation by ProPublica. According to the ProPublica investigation, at least one of Justice Thomas' vacations cost over $500,000. Whitehouse said when justices take large gifts from people with business and political interests that the Supreme Court affects, those gifts can undermine the judicial process and erode trust.“It is highly corrosive of trust in that impartiality,” said Whitehouse. Other Supreme Court justices have also faced scrutiny over gifts and trips. But unlike Justice Thomas’ gifts, most of these were disclosed.Whitehouse is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which introduced a measure to require Supreme Court justices to be held to the same code of conduct as members of Congress and other federal judges. At a minimum, Whitehouse said, this means disclosing large gifts. A committee hearing will take place on May 2, without Chief Justice Roberts present.“I think Congress has solid authority to require basic ethics requirements in the executive branch of government, over ourselves and in the judicial branch of government,” Whitehouse said. He emphasized this would be regulation of justices' administrative conduct, not their judicial decisions. This would require the Supreme Court to have an enforceable, formal code of conduct, which it does not currently have. It’s unclear how much legislation Congress will be able to enforce, but Whitehouse is hoping for bipartisan support. He said Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham has expressed support for the Supreme Court reporting rule.“That shouldn’t be asking much. Everybody already does it,” Whitehouse said.",National,"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:55:29 EST",e86a3322a98c3d5b04bd8d9a5ccc5ce3
6833,‘Full-scale humanitarian crisis’: Chelsea receives a growing number of migrant families,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/10/full-scale-humanitarian-crisis-chelsea-receives-a-growing-number-of-migrant-families,An unexpected arrival one night last week kicked off 250 individuals coming through nonprofit La Colaborativa in just three days.,"Local officials from Chelsea say they were taken by surprise last week by a late-night drop-off of some 30 migrants, including children. Alex Train, director of Housing and Community Development for the city of Chelsea, said Monday that the group was dropped off about 10 p.m. on Wednesday after the state was overwhelmed by a number of migrants arriving that day to its newly opened Welcome Center in Allston. Train said La Colaborativa, Chelsea’s main partner to help new migrants, worked to “provide basic aid, emergency food assistance, access to basic health care, and ultimately emergency shelter.” He said the group included families with medical issues and suffering trauma from their journey. He called the situation a “full-scale humanitarian crisis.”Whether or not staff from the nonprofit La Colaborativa was aware of their arrival is up for debate. Gladys Vega, head of the social-services nonprofit, originally told members of the media that she wasn’t given a heads-up about their arrival. But state officials told GBH News that the state Office of Refugees and Immigrants “had multiple conversations with La Colaborativa about their capacity and willingness to support these families.” “We have been working closely with La Colaborativa since last week on an orderly process to transition families to hotels,” state officials told GBH News on Monday in a statement released by Gov. Maura Healey's office. Healey’s office says the state is contracting with La Colaborativa to provide hotel rooms for homeless families under the Emergency Assistance program, with costs covered by the state. Nearly 70 municipalities across the state are hosting families needing emergency assistance, state officials said. The governor’s office said it continues to work with local and federal partners and community organizations to expand capacity of the emergency assistance system and find long-term solutions. In a high-cost state like Massachusetts, housing can be hard to find — even in the short term. La Colaborativa is currently helping temporarily house new arrivals in hotels in Everett, Saugus, Quincy and other areas. The state’s emergency shelter system is strained by the regional housing affordability crisis, and the lack of capacity is warranting the opening of new facilities, like Joint Base Cape Cod. “Due to a critical shortage of available shelter beds and an increase in demand, we have had to use hotels and motels as a temporary, last resort to ensure families have safe housing,” the statement from Healey’s office continued. “The Family Welcome Center in Allston remains open as a central intake center, and we are connecting families with shelter as quickly as possible – whether that’s at Joint Base Cape Cod, hotels or other sites based on availability.”Officials from La Colaborativa declined to comment, saying that “due to rapid ongoing development of the situation and the sensitive nature of the cases, the state had asked the organization to refrain from interviews.”The nonprofit shared Instagram posts last week saying that, in just three days, its triage department “provided wraparound services for 250 individuals,” most of whom are Haitian. “Those services include food, housing, health assessments, and rapid reemployment.” Photos posted show families eating and children coloring at the organization’s offices in Chelsea. The Rev. Myrlande Desrosier, who heads the Everett Haitian Community Center, said she sent members of her team to Chelsea on Wednesday night when she heard La Colaborativa needed help. “Three things, people ask for. The first thing is spiritual support for the trauma. Secondly, people ask for some Haitian food. And the third is the housing,” she said. “In the beginning it’s like, ‘Let’s just get them some food.’ Many had not eaten in quite some time.” During the first two days, she said at least one woman needed medical care. “There was some cases, at least one of emergency pregnancy issues,” said Desrosiers.Train said many migrants have arrived in Massachusetts after being bused by Republican governors to New York City and eventually traveling north to Boston.“The city, La Colaborativa and our community-based partners barely sufficient resources to provide ample services for our existing residents, so this is truly outstripping our resource levels at this point, warranting state and federal resources,” he said. Train said the city was surprised by the arrivals, but the state has no way of predicting the numbers for planning purposes. “We see the state partners here doing the best they can with the systems that they have,'' he said. ""Unfortunately, those systems are not at adequate capacity don't have enough resources and need to be rapidly scaled. And what occurred Wednesday night was a major byproduct of that.”",Local,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 19:37:00 EST",f7288041fd6a729d6edc5b5f6a51757a

Sure, you’ve banned books by Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation. The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.” As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — because today is rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl, both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans. My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstar LeBron James toppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history.",Commentary,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 05:00:53 EST",56c163d7bc89c1725e2c1a6f2fa9dcfd

Osgood said bridging gaps with mental health, education and policing are all key to helping reduce violence. ""If we don't have resources in the community for the young people, the system is kind of stacked against them,"" he said. ""And until we understand that, we will go around in circles.""

3092,Boston nonprofit Street2Ivy is producing this generation's entrepreneurs,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/03/boston-nonprofit-street2ivy-is-producing-this-generations-entrepreneurs,CEO and founder Tavares Brewington speaks on bringing new opportunities to underserved communities.,"With the endless slew of bad news infiltrating headlines every day, it’s easy to slip into what some call a “doomer” mindset, filled with helplessness, aimlessness and apathy. So the All Things Considered team wants to highlight some of the great work our local leaders are doing to fight that dreary outlook, all while giving back to their communities. To kick off the “Joy Beat,” Tavares Brewington, founder of the nonprofit Street2Ivy, sat down with All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss his work empowering underserved communities through entrepreneurship and helping to fill gaps created by longstanding wealth disparities. Brewington was recently honored as one of the Forbes Next 1000, which celebrates small business owners across the country. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: I gave a vague, bland description in the intro, but give us a bit more detailed explanation about what Street2Ivy’s mission is and how it came into being.Tavares Brewington: At Street2Ivy, our mission is really to bring the joy and the power of innovation and entrepreneurship to young people from underserved communities who may not have access to those tools. Street2Ivy came into being after I graduated after a long career as an attorney. I went back to business school at Cornell University and participated in their Innovation Program and really fell in love with it. I wanted to bring that knowledge back to the community, so that’s what Street2Ivy is and where it came from. Rath: I’ve been blessed to be pretty privileged growing up and have that kind of privilege for my kids. But I know the kind of opportunities you’re talking about, things like entrepreneurship and these kinds of ways in, they all take time and money. How do you pull that together for people who don’t have access to time and money easily? Brewington: You’re absolutely right, but what we really focus on is the information and knowledge and the process of innovation and design thinking and the power that’s in that. What we really focus on in our program is really helping young people learn the information. We also want them to build confidence that they can work with the information, and we try and connect them with business leaders in the city. The core of the program is really about creating leaders in the community. We teach young people how to think about a problem, how to isolate it, state it specifically and then develop a solution, a draft solution or a mock-up of a solution, and go back to the community that they seek to serve and get the customer feedback to perfect it. Ultimately, we work with them on the financial modeling piece and marketing and how you raise capital. But at the core, it’s really about how you become a problem solver. How do you isolate a problem? You identify a solution and work with those who are in your community and are dealing with that problem to come up with a solution that works. So that’s what we really want to get across through our programming. Rath: My next question was about how Street2Ivy has grown. It sounds like what you’re talking about is seeing a problem and finding out a way to try to fix it. Talk about that growth because you’ve started with an online academy, right? And there’s a magazine and these youth programs. Tell us about the journey.Brewington: So the first program we were able to run, we actually partnered with the Boston branch of the NAACP, and we ran it as a part of Gov. Baker’s Summer Nights program. We have a group of 20 kids who participate in a six-week program, and it was a success. We even had the governor come in and sit through some of the modules that we had. The kids really enjoy that. Every program culminates into a ""Shark Tank""-like presentation. After that initial program focused on traditional entrepreneurship, we actually developed a real estate development program that works with developers in the city to teach young people about that space as well. So we’ve grown. We’ve been lucky enough to run a number of these programs over the last four to five years, and it’s been exciting. More and more young people are seeing the benefit of creativity, how to harness their creativity and the value of having a framework by which they can take their idea from just an idea to something that’s tangible and can have an impact. Rath: I want to talk about your work in Seaport because something that I didn’t even stop to think about really — honestly, embarrassingly — and I was reading about what would be a historic first for Massachusetts: a historically Black college or university. It’s kind of mad, if you think about it, that there isn’t that already in Boston. Tell us your thoughts about that and how you think we might get there. Brewington: We’re part of a team that submitted a response to a request for a proposal from the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority to develop a tract of land in the Seaport. Part of the proposal is to offer a development of an art gallery that would focus on Black and brown artists. But it’s more than a gallery; it’s really a space for artists and creatives to come and learn their craft and the business. In addition to that, we’ve proposed a design center where we will work with you people to really have a place to innovate. Part of that is partnering with Pensole Lewis College of Business and Design, which is a historically Black college based in Detroit. It’s run by Dr. D’Wayne Edwards, who was the manager of Michael Jordan’s Air Jordan brand for decades. He specializes in sneaker design, which is becoming a huge thing amongst young people. There are a lot of sneaker artists; it’s an $86 billion industry, and Massachusetts has a special place in that industry because we have most of the major brands here in Massachusetts. What we’re proposing is to work with Pensole Lewis to run courses around sneaker design and business to help more young people enter that market and enter into an industry that’s so big in this state.Rath: Something I know about from my teenage son now is that there are fortunes to be made in sneakers these days. Brewington: Yeah, it’s really exciting. I mean, it’s something that all kids love. I think it brings people from all backgrounds together, and it would just be a historic opportunity to really provide that opportunity for young people in the city, really to get involved in the industry that’s worldwide — people love sneakers, and they love the design aspect all over the world. I think having that in Boston, next to the convention center, we can see it being an attraction that brings people from all over the place here to Massachusetts on the diversity and inclusion side. Really, it gives young people who may not have an opportunity, chance or resource where they can learn to generate wealth for themselves, and also highlights the rich culture that exists, the diverse culture that actually exists in Boston.Rath: Why Seaport?Brewington: The Seaport is an up-and-coming area. I’ve been in Boston for a while and have seen it grow, but we want to make sure that everyone has access and feels welcome there. To the extent we can, we want to make sure that there are resources for everyone and attractions for everyone. It’s just a wonderful place to be, but we wanted to make it a wonderful place to be for the greatest number of people and have it really reflect that rich, diverse culture that is Boston.",Local,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 17:33:16 EST",d7ddd90a003f61a9964e1e5d48e7f63e

Even with help, she typically spends more than $1,000 on school supplies, classroom decorations and snacks, she says. But this year, she's trying to spend around $800, although she doesn't know whether that will be possible with inflation.""I'm going to have a ton of out-of-pocket expenses as a classroom teacher to make sure that my students have what they need,"" Stassen said.Many parents are also hoping to pull back on spending on school supplies this year, according to a survey released Wednesday by Deloitte. The firm is predicting that spending will decrease 10% from last year, marking the first decline since 2014, said Stephen Rogers, the managing director of Deloitte's Consumer Industry Center. Inflation is having a big impact on how parents are shopping, he said.""So parents who say they're spending more and parents who say they're spending less, both blame inflation for that,"" Rogers said. ""So that's also a curious place where we find ourselves. Inflation is definitely top of mind for everyone.""Nabbing a $3 shirt and looking for discountsPrices for school supplies have jumped nearly 24% in the last two years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Due to the higher prices, many shoppers this year are focusing more on getting classroom supplies like folders and pencils than they are on new clothes or tech products, Rogers said.Melissa Wright, a parent and former elementary school teacher in Chandler, Ariz., is back-to-school shopping this week before her kids' first day of school next Wednesday. She's aiming to spend under $250 on clothes and supplies for both of her kids.""I use the Target Circle app, so today even for the shirts and stuff I bought my daughter, they were all like 30% off. One of them I looked at rang up like 3 bucks,"" said Wright. ""I do love a sale.""She isn't alone. Most shoppers are planning back-to-school shopping around sales events, according to the National Retail Federation. Deloitte's survey found that 69% of shoppers will look at back-to-school deals on Amazon during its Prime Day event, which started Tuesday and ends Wednesday. But people prefer to shop in person for the majority of their back-to-school shopping.Stassen, however, is relying more heavily on online shopping to prepare for her return to the classroom, as well as to get items for her first-grader and fourth-grader. She works as an assistant director at a Pennsylvania summer camp, and she won't be back home in Georgia until right before school starts on Aug. 1.""Like many parents I know, we're all doing our school supply shopping online as best we can while we're away and just getting things shipped to the house,"" said Stassen.To save money, she also plans to use teacher discounts where offered and visit secondhand stores to maximize her budget.""I definitely try to keep my ear to the street for when those teacher discount days are happening, for my classroom and for my own kids,"" Stassen said.Summer started less than a month ago, but already it's time to shop for schoolThe bulk of back-t0-school shopping will be over before July ends — even though some schools won't open until September. According to Deloitte, 59% of total back-to-school spending is expected to take place in July.Despite financial concerns, some shoppers will still splurge on some items, Rogers said. Wright said she'll probably spend the most money on new shoes and backpacks for her kids. According to the Deloitte survey, parents are most likely to splurge on apparel and tech, with 6 in 10 parents saying they would spend more on higher-quality items or to ""treat their child,"" an experience Rogers shared.""It's something very familiar with me,"" he said.

240,Boston recognizes the African and Indigenous heritage of the first person killed in the American Revolution,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/05/boston-recognizes-the-african-and-indigenous-heritage-of-the-first-person-killed-in-the-american-revolution,"Earlier this week, Mayor Michelle Wu declared March 5 to be 'Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day'","For more than two hundred years, March 5 has been known as the anniversary of the Boston Massacre in the City of Boston. But on Sunday, the city marked the day as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day in honor of the man who is historically regarded as the first person killed by British shots on March 5, 1770. It’s a move that comes as the city aims to grapple with its own past and give a better picture of who Attucks was. At an event on Thursday announcing the official commemoration, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu remarked that the narratives of the day often portrayed Attucks as white, erasing his mixed African and Native American heritage. “Erasing the fact that a formerly enslaved man faced down British muskets for our nation’s freedom,” she said. “And erasing the historical fact that it was the courage of a person of color that stoked the flames of this revolution.”Wu said that the acknowledgement of March 5 as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day is in the spirit of the city’s new reparations task force, saying that that work must begin with a “recognition of the full truth of our history, the kind of truth on which meaningful healing and repair can finally be built.”The move was applauded by Haroon Rashid with the Friends of Crispus Attucks Association, who said at Thursday’s event that many historians have recognized Attucks’ contributions. “However, in the 21st century, few political leaders have publicly stated the importance of knowing that a man of African and American Indigenous descent became popularly known as the first to defy and the first to die for American independence,” he said. “And his name was Crispus Attucks.”On Sunday, at the Old State House, one program focused on the impact of the many forms of political violence from the state. Nathaniel Sheidley, president and CEO of Revolutionary Spaces, said that while they didn’t know that Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day would coincide with that programming when they were planning it, they have been trying to center Attucks in their telling of the Boston Massacre for a while now. He said that the commemoration is important not just for Attucks’ legacy, but for Boston. “I think that one of the challenges that we face as a city is to tell the story of our city’s role in the nation’s founding in a way that allows all of our residents to see themselves reflected in that story and to feel a sense of pride in it,” he said. “And Attucks is a really critical figure. He reminds us that Boston has always been a diverse place. And that people at all levels of our society have been contributors to our journey together across 250 years.”Sheidley also pointed out that while the city is officially recognizing a day to honor Attucks, the idea of a Crispus Attucks Day goes back all the way to the 1850s, when Black abolitionists chose to the use the anniversary of the Boston Massacre to make a statement about slavery. In the 20th century, the Boston Equal Rights League used the day to talk about the contributions of Black Bostonians and Americans. “And I think it’s important that we recognize that this moment of inflection, kind of official blessing of the idea of Crispus Attucks Day, is thanks to many who have been advocating for this for a long time,” he said. One of the speakers at the Old State House on Sunday was Charlot Lucien, founder of the Haitian Artists Assembly of Massachusetts. He said that there are a couple of reasons why recognizing Attucks is important. First, he said there is the imperative to acknowledge the contributions of Black people to the American Revolution. “So, had we erased Crispus Attucks in such a way that his name wasn’t known, his face wasn’t known, it would have been a missed opportunity for history and for the U.S. to embrace the richness of what happened in the U.S.,” he said. He also tied the violence inflicted upon Attucks to violence that has historically been inflicted upon Black people across the world.“And we need to relate a massacre in Boston to massacres that took place in other places and countries and states where Boston residents migrated from,” he said. “So, this interconnectedness that can be promoted through this should not be underestimated. It has value for Boston, it has value for Boston communities and for any other state or country that at some point relates to Boston through either migration, immigration or through history.”",Local,"Sun, 05 Mar 2023 20:23:39 EST",a746a677fa55619c581c2ce3286d6077

They were traveling from the southern town of Araracuara to San José del Guaviare with their mother aboard a single-engine Cessna to visit her husband, the father of two of the children.He told reporters that he had fled the area after being threatened by a guerrilla group that he feared would try to recruit his children.The search team vowed not to leave until they'd found the childrenThe Cessna developed engine trouble and disappeared May 1. It's currently the rainy season in the region and due to cloud cover and constant downpours, it took the army reconnaissance aircraft two weeks to locate the crash site. There, they found the dead bodies of all three adults aboard the plane, including the children's mother, Magdalena Mucutuy, 33.The one positive sign was that the children were missing. They had been seated in the rear of the aircraft, which may have helped them survive the impact of the crash.""Once the aircraft wreckage was found and there was no sign of the children, there was an objective: to find those children,"" Garzón says. ""We were not going to leave that place unless we found them.""Alfredo Acosta, one of dozens of Indigenous volunteers who worked together with Colombian troops, says the children probably abandoned the crash site to get away from the dead bodies, which could attract dangerous animals, and also to look for food and water.The children had vital knowledge and skills to survive in the jungleThey were well-prepared to forage because they were raised in the jungle, says Consuelo de Vengoechea, a Colombian anthropologist and linguist who, over the past 30 years, has studied the Huitoto culture and language — and, for part of that time, lived with the children's family near Araracuara, becoming close friends with their deceased mother.""This was the family that opened their door to me"" for doing research, de Vengoechea says.While there, she says youngsters were constantly climbing trees, gathering edible fruit and taking part in Indigenous ceremonies in which they sang and celebrated the bounty of the jungle.""They are taught from a very young age how to take care of themselves,"" de Vengoechea says. ""Their parents and grandparents are all the time teaching these children what they can eat and why.""Relatives told her that while lost in the jungle, the kids consumed an Amazonian fruit known as juan soco, which is similar to passionfruit, as well as seeds from the milpesos palm tree, which are like tiny coconuts and contain oil and vitamins. They also came upon a box of food airdropped by the military.The kids had found an 11-pound bag of yuca flour in the airplane and kept baby Cristin alive by feeding her the flour dissolved in water. De Vengoechea says that Lesly used a leaf to drip the mixture into the baby's mouth.Cristin turned one during their time in the jungle, and Tien, her older brother, turned five.The kids had a mosquito net and a plastic tarp, on top of which they piled banana leaves to bunk down at night and stay warm. This was key because even in the tropical rainforest, the temperature rapidly drops after sundown. And in the constant rain, their clothes were always wet.Indigenous guides relied on traditional knowledge during the searchThe Colombian military used reconnaissance flights, infrared sensors, satellite imagery and other technology in the search for the children, and deployed 110 special forces on the ground. But the jungle was so thick that it was very slow going, Garzón says.The forces received a huge boost from the Indigenous guides — but even they found the surroundings challenging, says Acosta.""It was virgin jungle. You look in any direction and all you see are huge trees. It's very easy to get lost,"" Acosta says.They came across deer, tapirs, oncillas — which look like small tigers — and poisonous snakes. They were constantly attacked by mosquitoes, flies and ants, and sometimes ran out of food. The rain never seemed to let up.""We were wet all the time,"" he says.Rather than modern technology, the Indigenous guides leaned on tradition. Every day, they held ceremonies to asked permission of the spirits to enter the jungle. Some of them took ayahuasca, a psychedelic brew made of jungle plants, in the hopes that the hallucinogenic visions would point them in the right direction.""They are so good at understanding this spiritual dimension and that was the best addition to the search team,"" Garzón says. ""That's what fills the gap between what you can and cannot see in the jungle.""As the search dragged on, the fate of the children became a national obsession in Colombia.Manuel Ranoque, the father of the two youngest children, insisted that all four were still alive and pointed out that one of his sisters was once lost in the jungle for a month but survived.John Frank Pinchao — a Colombian policeman who in 1998 was kidnapped by Marxist guerrillas and then escaped into the jungle and was rescued after 17 days — also insisted the kids had a fighting chance, as long as they avoided mosquitoes transmitting malaria. But in a radio interview, he also warned: ""There are piranhas, tarantulas and all kinds of snakes.""A rescue dog named Wilson helped locate the children — but is missing nowDuring the third week of the search, President Gustavo Petro announced on Twitter that the kids had been rescued — but quickly admitted that he had received erroneous information and deleted the tweet.The main challenge in finding them was the fact that the children spent much of their time in the jungle hiding. De Vengoechea, the anthropologist, says they were probably spooked by the sound of the helicopters and were conditioned to avoid strangers in the jungle.""They might have thought the guerrillas were coming after them,"" says Garzón, who points out that the troops came across an abandoned rebel encampment near the crash site.To convince the kids to show themselves, their grandmother recorded a message for Lesly in Huitoto that was broadcast into the jungle. In it, she said: ""Lesly, this is your grandmother. I am asking you a favor. You must remain calm and stay put.""In the end, it was a Belgian Shepherd rescue dog named Wilson, from the Colombian Army, who first came across the children.""The kids, they were telling us they were joined by the dog. And it was a good sign for them because they said: 'Someone is here,'"" Garzón says. (Wilson, however, has gone missing and a formal search is underway to find him).The children are gradually regaining their strength after a dramatic rescueFinally, last Friday — the children's 40th day in the jungle — the search party found them about 2 1/2 miles from the crash site. Photos and videos of that moment show them sitting on the jungle floor, looking weak and emaciated, their clothes in tatters. Soldiers quickly wrapped them in space blankets.""It's not just a miracle to have found them. It's a miracle they were still alive,"" Gen. Pedro Sánchez, the commander of the search and rescue team, told reporters.But they were stranded in a patch of rainforest so thick there was no place for the rescue helicopter to land.Instead, as a chopper hovered overhead, troops rappelled down to the jungle floor and then hoisted the children back up to the aircraft. Once on board, doctors treated them for dehydration and malnutrition.""A kid from the city might get scared in the jungle. But they didn't get scared,"" Acosta says. ""They knew how to move around. They understood the jungle because of their ancestral knowledge. That allowed them to survive.""Now the kids are being treated at the Central Military Hospital in Bogotá.Their great-uncle, Fidencio Valencia, says they're still weak but that the color is returning to their faces.As for Lesly, the heroine who carried her baby sister through the jungle and kept all her siblings alive, she still has a bruise on her forehead from the airplane crash.Valencia says: ""I tell her: 'Don't worry. All this will be over soon, and you will again be very beautiful."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]",International News,"Sat, 17 Jun 2023 05:01:00 EST",d336d6c88109ea9b46300eb6dc368a40
2345,GBH's Salud is helping Latinos navigate the health care system in new season,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/25/gbhs-salud-is-helping-latinos-navigate-the-health-care-system-in-new-season,A show unlike what you usually hear on GBH is now in its second season.,"Salud, the Spanish language series which focuses on health issues in the Latino community, has returned to GBH's airwaves. The show, produced in collaboration with El Planeta, is now in its second season. Tibisay Zea, the show's host, joined GBH's Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to talk about the new season. This transcript has been lightly edited.Salud airs Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. on GBH. It’s also available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other podcast platforms. Jeremy Siegel: You and I spoke at the outset of the initial launch of the show, and you talked about the importance of focusing on health issues specific to the Latino community to combat misinformation and skepticism surrounding medicine. I want to talk about the importance of the way you're covering these issues and how this is a Spanish language show, because people listening know GBH as a station usually broadcasting in English. It's kind of an obvious question, I imagine, in some ways. But why is it important to have the show in Spanish? Tibisay Zea: This is a country that offers a lot of opportunities for immigrants like myself, but yet it is very unequal and it doesn't really offer the best standards of living for many people, which affects our health. And in fact, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy of any high-income country, which is only 76 years old. And something we found interesting and shocking at the same time is that Hispanics have higher risks of having many health problems like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and hypertension compared to other groups, in part because we are less likely to have health insurance and to receive preventive medical care, to have a primary doctor. And this is concerning. All of this has to do with the fact that our health system is very complicated here in the U.S. from how to qualify, how to enroll, how it works, you know, that terminology. You have co-payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, Medicare, Obamacare, Medicaid, all the different letters that arrive in the mail when you enroll in health insurance. So that can be very confusing and complicated to understand. It's overwhelming for most people. And imagine how it is for immigrants that are not familiar at all with how it works, and many times they don't have the language. So we think this podcast gives a critical voice to the diversity of the American experience in terms of health care, the voice of the Latinos, which is the population that keeps growing and growing. We believe this is just a public service for Spanish speakers in this country: High quality, reliable information about health care in Spanish. More than 40 million people speak Spanish in this country. Siegel: And you've already had one season of this show air on GBH. I'm curious, have you heard from any people about how they're receiving the show, people in the Latino community around here in Massachusetts about what it's meant for them? Zea: Yes, it was well-received. We launched our first season last year in the fall, and we got a lot of comments, people even suggesting new topics. They were interested. And actually, the first episode of our second season, in which we explained the many barriers and obstacles that Latinos have to access health care — that's an idea that came from one of our listeners that was so frustrated because she was getting all these letters in the mail that she couldn't understand, even though the letters were in Spanish. But they were just so confusing that she wanted to understand: Help me understand how to enroll in health insurance. So we decided to do a whole episode about how complicated our health care system is and how to map, how to navigate it. What I think is important is that we try to bring Latinos into the show to tell the stories. Siegel: So in addition to this episode that helps people figure out the complicated nature of the health care system, what else can someone who's tuning in this Saturday or catching up with the feed of Salud where they get their podcasts — what can they expect this season? Any other topics you're particularly interested in having covered this year? Zea: So this time we have episodes on childhood obesity, oral health, also cardiovascular diseases. We have one episode that we highly recommend about the Fentanyl crisis, which is a well-documented national emergency, which is also affecting Latinos, many Hispanics in this country. We faced a lot of disadvantages in terms of access to health care. Part of it is because immigrants tend to have jobs with little flexibility to ask for — you know, days off to go to a medical appointment, for example, or we tend to have jobs with low pay. So many times, immigrants have to work multiple jobs or live in areas where there are less medical centers, less opportunities to exercise outdoors or to buy healthy food. And this is why we think that this podcast is important, because it's useful information in their language, and we are trying to just educate people on health care basics.",Local,"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 10:29:56 EST",f50dd267ab82e617888edefbe399aaea

Healey says she’s “focused on affordability” to keep people from moving away.,"Gov. Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state’s future, saying she sees a “big need” to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families. Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state’s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states. “We need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,” Healey said. As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up. Healey’s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey’s tax package — a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million — earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.""By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor’s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state’s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,"" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement. In an interview later Thursday on GBH’s Boston Public Radio, Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts’ tax policy more in line with other states. “Only 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, … we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,” Healey said. “But honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state. She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year. Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance. In other budget matters, Healey said she’s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education. She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. “We need to do everything we can to get rid of them,” Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country. Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people’s voices to the table and that she “might even have a youth council of my own” at some point. She said she’ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected.",Politics,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 16:35:58 EST",6482378a56e852ea0dcbe9719535ac27
3103,Ask Dave Epstein: Are we in a heat wave?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/27/ask-dave-epstein-are-we-in-a-heat-wave,Three days of 90 degree temperatures in a row is needed to be considered a heat wave.,"Meteorologist Dave Epstein is our go-to person for pressing weather questions on everything from winter blizzards to summer droughts. He’s also a horticulturist, meaning he’s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Epstein graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.While people often use the term colloquially to talk about hot days, meteorologists don’t consider it a heat wave until an area has had recorded temperatures hit 90 for three days in a row. “If we reach 90 today, which is a really good bet, that would be day one,” Epstein said. “Tomorrow might be day two. And then we've got to hit 90 Saturday for day three. So it's only going to be a three-day heat wave, which is a minimal heat wave.”Ask Dave Epstein: Does extreme summer weather signal a new phase of climate change?Because it’s going to be hot, it’s a good idea to stay out of the sun, wear sunscreen and drink plenty of water. “I think trying to keep all this in perspective,” Epstein said. “If you're outside, then you want to be sure you're taking care of yourself. Otherwise, this is not an unprecedented heat wave or anything like we've seen around the world this summer.”Wild mushrooms are a delightful surprise. But never, ever, ever eat a mushroom found in the yard or in the wild without being absolutely sure of what kind of mushroom it is, Epstein said. Since the listener who sent the question did not add a photo or a description of the mushrooms, Epstein could not give a definitive answer. “There are a lot of edible mushrooms out there this year,” Epstein said. “But, and this is the huge caveat, you can kill yourself if eat the wrong one, or get very sick.”To be sure, there are some delicious edible mushrooms that may come up: Chanterelles, for instance, or hen of the woods mushrooms. There are also dangerous look-alikes to avoid: Toxic jack-o-lantern mushrooms and false chanterelles, which can cause severe stomach upsets; or highly toxic death cap mushrooms, which can look a bit like edible puffballs when they first pop up. “You've got to go with somebody that really knows what they're doing,” Epstein said. “Do not do it on your own based on the Internet.”Amending the sand with another kind of soil may be necessary, Epstein said. But there are options: Thyme may do well, as would ajuga, sometimes called bugleweed or ground pine. “I planted the ajuga at that spot between your yard and the street, there's that little strip and that's often very sandy and gets sand from the plows and all that,” Epstein said. “And it does well. It's a nice groundcover and it actually gets a little flower.”Ground ivy is hard to get rid of, Epstein said. “It's a very difficult plant, I have it in the in the yard as well,” Epstein said. His treatment was more preventative: Because ivy typically comes in early in the growing season, he’ll go into his garden in the early spring and dig up its roots. “It's like almost like a thread,” he said. “Once you get one piece of it, it's pretty easy to pull out.”Since it’s already taken over this year: There are some nonorganic treatments, which Epstein said he tries to avoid where he can.“Keeping the lawn really thick will help, but otherwise you're going to have to treat it with a chemical, which, as you know, I'm not a big fan of,” he said.The goal of no-dig or no-till gardening is to keep disturbances of the local ecosystem to a minimum, Epstein said. Instead of using a big shovel (or, in industrial farms, heavy machinery) to overturn the soil, no-till or no-dig gardening involves handling the top layer of soil more gently. “I try to do just pull the stuff out and gently, with my hands, kind of work in some soil amendments and then plant from there,” Epstein said. “I'm not putting a big shovel down and turning the soil over. You really disturb that little ecosystem that's developed.”",Local,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:30:25 EST",91a979404558c24e7e11e18de00eba98
1863,Carrie Moore looks to guide Harvard women's basketball to new destinations,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/10/carrie-moore-looks-to-guide-harvard-womens-basketball-to-new-destinations,Moore took over for longtime head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith last year,"For most basketball teams, success begins on the hardwood. For Harvard women’s basketball this year, it may have started on the Charles River. Last fall, after a pre-season practice had wrapped up, first-year head coach Carrie Moore took her team out with Harvard women’s lightweight rowing team to get a taste of navigating as a team on the water. Unfortunately, the conditions weren’t the best. “It was, like, freezing and raining and we had just had practice and [Moore was] like, ‘All right, let’s go, let’s go to the river!’” said senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy, who had never been rowing before. Moore — who herself had also never rowed before — admits that she was scared. But the rowers, who were sprinkled among the basketball players in the boats, assured them that the odds of tipping over were low. After that, the reason for the trip started to come through. “I think you learn a lot on the boat,” Moore said. “Just in terms of it’s not an individual sport by any means. If one person is off at all in terms of their technique, the boat is shifting left or right. The balance has to be perfect.”It’s not the typical exercise for a basketball program that for 40 seasons was led by Kathy Delaney-Smith, after whom the head coaching position at Harvard is named. But in her first year as skipper, Moore has steered the Crimson’s ship to the Ivy League tournament with a 16-10 record in her first year, two wins away from an automatic berth in the NCAA tourney. For Moore, it’s all part of the plan as she aims to keep Harvard on the course Delaney-Smith set — and even go beyond. It would be natural for just about anyone to be intimidated when trying to fill the big shoes of Delaney-Smith. Over her four decades at Harvard, she racked up 630 wins, winning nearly 70% of her games in the Ivy League along the way. But for Moore, who came to Harvard from the University of Michigan, that torch wasn’t a burden. “I don’t know if I necessarily have ever felt it as pressure,” Moore said. “I think, if anything, I just see it as a tremendous opportunity. Because she proved that you can win at a very high level here. Which means that it’s possible for us to do what we want to do.”For players like senior guard and captain McKenzie Forbes, one of the things that helped with the transition is that Moore made a lasting first impression.“I feel like the person we got that day is like the same Coach Moore that we have to this day, and I think everyone can appreciate that,” Forbes said. “And like feel that when you’re meeting someone new, you can kind of like get that vibe of like, ‘OK, what kind of person are they?’ And I think she’s very authentic, very genuine with us.”On the court, the seeds of that authenticity are on full display. During the regular season finale against Dartmouth at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion, Moore roamed the sidelines, her hands in her pockets, picking up every little detail and pulling players to the side for quick conversations the moment they stepped off the court.Even though the Big Green hadn’t won an Ivy League game all year, Moore coached with the focus you'd expect of someone in the Final Four. Harvard would go on to win in a 64-40 route. It’s the kind of attention to detail that Harvard will need as it heads into the Ivy League Tournament. But Moore’s core mantra of “Believe It” has the team feeling like they can run the table even as they face Columbia, the only Ivy League team Harvard hasn’t beaten this year.“This whole season, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and changing of the lineups with different injuries, different players being out. But she’s always like, ‘Believe It,’” McCarthy said with a snap of her finger. “All we have is all we need,” Forbes added. Over the course of the season, Moore’s learned a lot. One of the main lessons she’s come to understand is just how much patience the profession requires. She wants to hang banners and doesn’t want to settle for being third or fourth in the conference. She wants to recruit players who can change the trajectory of the program, and she hopes to make them into better people and players. Moore knows that’s coming. But if basketball is anything like rowing down a river, then even the best coaches have to get used to the water first.“I’m a Taurus and I’m extremely stubborn. And it’s incredibly hard for me to not have it all right now,” Moore said. “But I think I’ve learned that the lessons and the enjoyment is in the journey, not necessarily the destination. But we’ll get there.”",Local,"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 05:00:11 EST",4909949373ed4269ec62aacbef8f6f2e

2389,Laws banning 'critical race theory' in schools will persist. One of its originators says it's time to address the deeper issue.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/31/laws-banning-critical-race-theory-in-schools-will-persist-one-of-its-originators-says-its-time-to-address-the-deeper-issue,"Kimberlé Crenshaw says laws passed now will still stand in a century, and it's long past time to protect the teaching of Black history.","As part of a recently passed African American history standards initiative, Florida public schools will now teach students that some Black people benefitted from slavery because it taught them useful skills. It’s not the only one of its kind. “That was shocking to people because they understood that that was minimizing what enslavement was all about. But the whole point ... of anti-wokeness is to fundamentally change the story of the continuing relevance of enslavement and segregation,” Kimberlé Crenshaw said on Boston Public Radio Monday. Crenshaw, the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, says that many members of the public see the topline problems of censorship, but they don’t see how deep the problems go. Recognizing the intersectionality of the issues of race, gender and ideology, she says, is key to addressing the ongoing attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion — and Black history, in particular — in education. It’s an issue she also sees in colleges, such as the recent affirmative action ruling from the Supreme Court that dictated universities can no longer use race-conscious admissions. So far this year, 40 bills have been introduced across the country restricting colleges from having offices and staff devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion. Of those, seven have become law in North Dakota, Tenneesse, Florida and Texas. As more bills aimed at restricting diversity efforts in schools and the teaching of Black American history are proposed in statehouses across the nation, Crenshaw says these measures' effects will last far longer than the politcians who introduced them. ""It chills teachers not to teach this material. That is still going to be on the books. That will last long after we don't even remember who [Gov. Ron] DeSantis was. That's what we have to wake up to,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's not just about 2024, it's really about the rest of this century."" Crenshaw created the concept of intersectionality and is one of the scholars behind critical race theory. Critical race theory is, in part, an academic framework to look at institutional racial bias rather than individual actors. In many corners, critical race theory — often shortened as CRT — has become an imprecise catchall for ideas or parts of American history that some would rather not see taught in schools. But the exact definition doesn't matter, according to Crenshaw. She said that right-wing outrage over CRT is less about the specific material being taught and more about the loss of identity among white individuals. ""Most of those people who are upset, going to a school board meeting, saying 'I don't want CRT in schools' — they couldn't define that. Racial justice, diversity, they couldn't define it. But they don't have to. All they need to do is be wound up with the message that: this is something that's taking something away from you,"" Crenshaw said. ""It's getting people upset about what they feel they're personally losing. And it's not necessarily material, it could be psychological. It is: 'We [white people] are no longer the center of American story, we have to share it with other people — and we have to share it with other stories.'"" In Feburary, after backlash from conservatives, the College Board expunged the topics of intersectionality, critical race theory, the queer experience and more from its new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies. The move was highly criticized by civil rights advocates, including Crenshaw, and the College Board later walked it back in April.""We need to not racially appease. We need to realize that there's a long connection between racism and fascism and anti-Blackness — we're seeing it play out now,"" Crenshaw said. She says that putting up resistance to restrictions on Black education is vital. ""We need to recognize that when we see the likes of DeSantis, and others, coming after modest changes in the story that we tell about ourselves, that is calling us to defend the full narrative of the U.S. They're coming after those of us who value a multiracial democracy, so we need to show up as well,"" she said. Crenshaw will be participating in a panel Tuesday in Boston during the annual NAACP convention.",Local,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 19:34:43 EST",3bf29ccb3b9b2a8bd41c48def5c26121

At the summit, the recent dramatic increase in air travel and the need for better technology were cited as reasons for the rising number of close calls. But Logan Airport — where one of those recent incidents occurred — is one of 43 airports across the country that have been outfitted by the FAA with the latest technology to deter potential collisions.On Feb. 27, a LearJet began taking off on a runway at Logan Airport that crossed the landing path of an arriving JetBlue flight. The JetBlue plane suddenly aborted its landing to avoid collision. The circumstances that led to this close hall are still under investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.David Ishihara, director of aviation services at Logan, attended the FAA safety summit. On Thursday, he explained to Massport’s board that Logan was an early adopter of two safety systems to help prevent collisions. One is a ground-based radar that allows pilots to see both vehicles and other airplanes on the ground. It also will alert the pilot and control tower if an airplane on final approach is not headed for the runway on which it is cleared to land. The other safety system is a network of runway status lights installed along taxiways and runways throughout the airport. They flash red and warn pilots of potential conflicts between planes taking off and landing. Ishihara said that light system will be expanded this summer. Massport Director of Aviation Ed Freni reminded the board that all the radar systems that Ishihara referenced are maintained and installed by the FAA and not within Massport’s control.",Local,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 13:48:01 EST",627f05dfe7173024e097e6ab5a8be02a

But can it win a Grammy?,"Artificial intelligence has proved it can do a lot of things — from writing a radio script to render text into realistic artwork. But can it win a Grammy? Well, yes and no. The Recording Academy, which is the organization behind the Grammy Awards, outlined new rules ahead of next year's competition, one of which states that only ""human creators"" are eligible for the music industry's highest honor. Songs that include elements generated by AI can still be nominated, but there must be proof that a real person meaningfully contributed to the song too. With that, only humans — not AI — can nominate their work for an award. ""If there's an AI voice singing the song or AI instrumentation, we'll consider it,"" Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of the Recording Academy, told Grammy.com. ""But in a songwriting-based category, it has to have been written mostly by a human.""Mason added that AI will ""unequivocally"" shape the future of the music industry, and instead of downplaying its significance, the Grammy Awards should confront questions related to AI head on. ""How can we adapt to accommodate? How can we set guardrails and standards?"" Mason said. ""There are a lot of things that need to be addressed around AI as it relates to our industry.""The music industry is not the only field grappling to face a future where AI plays a bigger role.

George Santos surrendered to federal authorities at a courthouse in suburban Long Island on Wednesday facing thirteen counts of criminal wrongdoing.","CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. — Republican Rep. George Santos surrendered to federal authorities at a courthouse in suburban Long Island on Wednesday facing thirteen counts of criminal wrongdoing.Federal prosecutors say he allegedly ""devised and executed a scheme"" aimed at defrauding donors to his 2022 political campaign.""This indictment seeks to hold Santos accountable for various alleged fraudulent schemes and brazen misrepresentations,"" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace. ""Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself.""According to the criminal indictments, Santos claimed the money would fuel his bid for office, but instead spent the cash on luxury designer clothes and to make a car payment and pay personal credit card bills.Santos also faces a charge that in 2020, he fraudulently applied to receive unemployment benefits when he was employed and running for Congress in his first bid for public office. ""At the height of the pandemic in 2020, George Santos allegedly applied for and received unemployment benefits while he was employed and running for Congress,"" stated Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly, ina statement.Her office aided in the investigation. The freshman lawmaker pushed the boundaries of conventional political scandal after his victory in last November's midterms. It was revealed that he fabricated most of the persona presented to voters.Santos lied in interviews and campaign documents about his education, his professional accomplishments, his record as a champion volleyball player and his family's experiences in the Holocaust.He also faced multiple investigations into how he raised and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign cash, including a mysterious $700,000 gift he made to his own election effort.It remains unclear where that money came from.Santos, who has announced he plans to run for re-election in 2024 has become a pariah among many GOP leaders in New York, especially on Long Island.The influential Nassau County Republican Committee distanced itself from Santos and called for him to resign.Santos has remained defiant and at times even seemed to revel in the glare of media attention. He has previously admitted to ""embellishing"" his resume, but repeatedly denied any criminal wrongdoing. On May 6, Santos posted on Twitter a photo of a fortune cookie he said he had received at a meal. ""Life is more fun when you're the underdog competing against the giants,"" the fortune read.The Santos controversy has created a political headache for Republicans, especially in New York where GOP candidates face tough re-election fights next year. Speaking Tuesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he wouldn't demand that Santos resign. He compared the criminal charges against Santos to past cases involving Democratic lawmakers who remained in office while their cases played out.""If a person is indicted, they're not on committees, they have the right to vote, but they have to go to trial.""Phone calls to Santos' congressional offices and to his attorney have gone unanswered. Santos also hasn't commented about the charges on Twitter.Separate probes are also underway by the Nassau County district attorney in New York and the House Ethics Committee in Washington, D.C. A statement released by the House panel in April stated an investigative subcommittee will examine whether Santos ""engaged in unlawful activity"" during his 2022 campaign.

3008,Top stories GBH News is following this week,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/13/top-stories-gbh-news-is-following-this-week,The incoming nor'easter will be a stress test for Gov. Healey and the MBTA.,"Every week, GBH News assignment editor Matt Baskin joins GBH’s All Things Considered to look at stories the newsroom is following. This week, reporters will be covering the impact of a seemingly late nor'easter, the local reverberations of bank collapses, and a federal court challenge to Boston's recently redrawn voting district maps. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Baskin and host Arun Rath.Arun Rath: So the start of spring is only a week away, with winter coming to an end — well, we already know that winter is not necessarily coming to an end with spring in Massachusetts. But we're supposedly getting the first big snow event tomorrow, blasting a big, long time. How are we handling this big, impending massive snowstorm that we're told is happening? Matt Baskin: Well, as I think, you know, I'm a little bit allergic to making a big, big deal out of winter weather. This is New England; we can cope. And how many times have we had a nor'easter in the forecast that turns out to be a dud? That said, as you note, it's late in the season to be getting what seems like it could be our first serious snow of the year, at least in Eastern Mass. Supposedly, what this is going to look like is a lot of rain overnight with snow starting mid- to late-morning west of the city and in the early afternoon closer to the coast. We seem to be looking at about 8 inches around Greater Boston, up to a foot-and-a-half for points north and west. And again, in terms of timing, you're right, it's not at all unprecedented for us to get big snowstorms in March or even April. Back in 1997, we actually had a huge blizzard on April Fool's Day. I was in elementary school and I remember getting a surprise snow day.As far as what our coverage is going to look like, I don't think it's a good use of our reporters' time to go roaming through grocery stores to see how much milk and bread is still on the shelves. What we do will be about impact: what does this mean for schools; what does this mean for roads; and, of course, what does this mean for the T? You know, it's funny, it was eight years ago — 2015 — when the state's new governor, Charlie Baker, was just settling into office when Massachusetts got slammed with back-to-back-to-back snowstorms that crippled the T. Eight years later, Maura Healey is the new governor who's been on the job just a couple of months, the T is in absolute shambles, and here comes the snow. So this could be an interesting stress test for a transit system that's been stumbling and then some.Rath: And speaking of stress tests, the banking world is dealing with a big one right now. We saw the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Silicon Valley Bank in particular is known for funding startups, which might have been part of its problem. But that means that's reverberating locally, right?Baskin: It sure is. There are all sorts of startups and tech companies in Massachusetts that did their banking through SVB, and this has made for several very stressful days for them. They've been worried about everything from the basic responsibility of paying their workers on time to the very future of their businesses. It's important to say that this goes beyond just corporate players, too. Our journalists have heard that there are folks in and around Boston who had mortgages through SVB, we understand that SVB was a lender for some affordable housing projects that are in progress [and] some nonprofits may have apparently been impacted. Our colleague Sarah Betancourt has been reporting on this today. You'll probably be hearing her in your newscast coming up. And we'll have a story from her online at GBHNews.org, looking at how the tentacles of this screwup are extending far beyond Silicon Valley and affecting people here in Massachusetts. Rath: Finally, Matt, it's been a little while since we've heard about Boston's plan to remap its voting districts. Things got pretty heated in the City Council as it was being debated. And this is headed to court now?Baskin: That's right. Let me start with some background. In November, the City Council voted on and Mayor [Michelle] Wu signed a plan to redraw voting lines in the city. One of the goals was to give voters of color a better shot at exercising their power and improving the representation. But while this was under debate, City Councilor Frank Baker complained that the new districts would dilute the voting power of white Catholics in parts of Southie and Dorchester, his district, District 3. And he actually went so far as to suggest that this was some sort of inside job motivated by sectarianism, because the key city councilor behind the new map, Liz Breadon, is a Protestant originally from Northern Ireland. Baker was roundly and immediately condemned. He apologized. The new map passed 9-4 and mayor who signed it. So that was all four months ago. Now, folks who oppose the new map who lost out in the City Council are hoping they can win in a new venue, namely federal court. The plaintiffs, led by Robert O'Shea, who's the chair of the Democratic Committee in Ward 6 in Southie, argued that the map approved by the City Council and Mayor Wu is in violation of everything from Boston City Charter up to and including the United States Constitution. Their complaint raises concerns about splitting up votes in some big public housing projects between districts, and it claims that, as drawn, the map would disempower white voters. A couple city councilors are prepared to testify against the map process behind it. Not Frank Baker, but his colleagues Michael Flaherty and Ed Flynn. Flaherty is an at-large councilor representing the whole city. Flynn, son of former Mayor Ray Flynn, represents District 2, which includes parts of Southie and stands to shed some voters under the map in question, they'd be shifted into District 3. And Congressman Stephen Lynch is also on deck to testify. His congressional district includes parts of Boston we're talking about. And he, too, opposes this map. There's a hearing in federal court scheduled for tomorrow and we'll be covering it.Rath: Super interesting. I'm glad we're going to be on top of this map. Thank you.Baskin: You got it.",Local,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 17:26:22 EST",39f9ec4feee46bc6fa3d85abdc2ee0f5
3553,Former Harvard chemistry professor sentenced to home confinement for China scheme,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/04/26/former-harvard-chemistry-professor-sentenced-to-home-confinement-for-china-scheme,Attorneys for Charles Lieber cite his poor health,"A former Harvard chemistry professor convicted in 2021 of hiding his financial ties to the Chinese government will not spend time in prison. A federal judge in Boston sentenced Charles Lieber on Wednesday to six months home confinement and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine. In a court appearance, Lieber, who had been one of the world's top chemists until his arrest, expressed remorse.“I regret the things that brought me here,” he said, wiping away tears. “I lost my job, my career and my freedom.”Prosecutors had asked for a three-month prison term for the 64-year-old academic, who was recently diagnosed with lymphoma. The government also argued that Lieber should pay a fine of more than $180,000, stating in court documents that he had “embarked on a years-long scheme to further his career through lies and deceit, while also lining his pockets courtesy of the Chinese government.” Federal officials arrested Lieber on Harvard’s campus as part of the China Initiative, an effort launched by the Justice Department under the Trump administration to counter academic espionage and theft of American intellectual property. A jury found Lieber guilty of lying to Harvard and the IRS about payments he received for participating in a recruitment program organized by the Chinese government. Lieber quietly resigned from his position at Harvard, where he had been on paid administrative leave. In pushing for a lighter sentence and home detention, Lieber’s attorneys argued that he didn’t knowingly lie to the government. They also said Lieber's late stage cancer diagnosis and weakened immune system would mean that any time he spent in prison would be “a death sentence.""",Education,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 16:23:20 EST",14cc97275a456f2491b35a88f3e285fc
7681,"In California, wildfires are prevented by crews of unlikely firefighters: goats",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/10/in-california-wildfires-are-prevented-by-crews-of-unlikely-firefighters-goats,"The end of a quiet residential street in Glendale, Calif., is just one of many battlegrounds in the state's annual fight against wildfire season. And it's being waged by goats.","The end of a quiet residential street in Glendale, Calif., is just one of many battlegrounds in the state's annual fight against wildfire season. And it's being waged by goats.About 300 of them are spread out along the foothills and steep ridges of the Verdugo Mountains, which loom over multi-million dollar homes at the end of a cul de sac. The goats are busy chomping away on the dried-out vegetation that's exploded after this year's drought-busting rains.Seemingly oblivious to the 94 F heat, the animals are hard at work devouring several acres of dead, yellowed grasses, scrubby bushes and cactus, as well as some of southern California's most invasive plants, including star thistle and black mustard.""There's very little they won't eat. Even things that seem impossible. I don't know how their digestive systems deal with it, but they do,"" Michael Choi told NPR, squinting out at his herd from under a brown felt cowboy hat.Choi, 30, is the owner of Fire Grazers Inc., a service that uses its herds of goats to clear brush from hillsides, flatlands and other hard-to-climb terrain. It's a family business that he took over from his father a few years ago and now runs with two other brothers.Even after more than a decade in the business, he is still confounded by how the goats make such easy work of an array of prickly and painful plants.""It's mind boggling that they'll even eat star thistle, considering it's so painful to grab,"" he said. ""It's invasive. It just spreads everywhere. And if you try to weed whack it, you wind up getting poked in the face and then all over the body. But goats will come up to that and they'll just eat it up because it tastes good to them.""Choi's company is busier than ever this year after the drought-breaking rains of this past winter. The downpour led to more growth, which has led to greater demand. That, Choi said, has extended his season by a couple of months, from March through what potentially could be the early weeks of October.""There's so many more people who need the goats. And, we're moving slower than we normally would, because a goat doesn't care if there's more food. They eat at their pace. So we actually had to purchase more goats just to keep up with the jobs we have,"" Choi explained, noting that he's added a couple hundred more goats to his total ""trip,"" bringing them up to about 900.It's the herd's last day on this plot of land. Over two weeks, they've cleared about 14 acres of the vegetation that fuels wildfires. (They eat about one acre a day.)And in a few hours, Choi will be transporting the group to their next job in Rancho Palos Verdes, another wealthy enclave surrounded by tough-to-climb terrain. It's one of about five sites the company has going. So far, Fire Grazers Inc. has been contracted by the cities of Torrance, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, Orange County and even private homeowners with sprawling estates in Beverly Hills and Calabasas.While the practice of targeted grazing goes back centuries, it has been pushed aside by machines and chemical herbicides in the modern era. But following the unrelenting barrage of blazes in recent years, which have ravaged an average of nearly 400,000 acres of land each year, it's become a bigger part of California's strategy to reduce wildfire risk. Last year, the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection issued a grant for a pilot program testing whether goats can lower the risk of wildfires in a state preserve.Anything you can do, goats can do betterPatty Mundo, vegetation management inspector for the Glendale Fire Department, said it was local residents who suggested the idea of the goats two years ago. Since then, she's brought Choi and his goats back for an annual ""Bleat and Greet"" event, where the community is invited to get to know the fire-fighting heroes.It's a great way to raise awareness about the importance of proper land management, Mundo said.""We've had many fires in that exact same hillside where the goats are,"" she told NPR. ""And because it's right next to homes, the purpose of it was to create a buffer — a fire break — so that if we were to ever have a fire in that area, it'll stop or at the very least, slow it down.""Mundo has been working for the city since 2018, and she said there's been a fire ""every single year"" with the exception of 2022.If it were up to her, she'd lease the herd for a much longer stretch, she said. The city owns about 500 parcels of land, and with the budget that's allocated to fire prevention — $62,000, plus another $14,000 specifically for the goats — they can only afford to clear a fraction of it every year.""It's not fair,"" Mundo acknowledged. In her role, she said, ""I'm holding people accountable to clear their brush, but yet we can't keep up with ours.""The worst is when she gets calls from homeowners wondering when her department plans to eliminate dangerous overgrowth. ""They call us to tell us they're concerned ... and it just kills me,"" she said.City officials have applied for a series of grants that could more than triple Glendale's fire prevention budget, according to Mundo. That would mean more money to pay for the goats to graze for longer periods. As it stands, Mundo said the goats have saved the city precious financial resources. Brush crews are far more expensive because they rely on power tools, which need fuel. ""They have to use heavy equipment like chippers. And sometimes they have to take the vegetation to a landfill. So that's just an added cost,"" she said. There are also additional fees to remove poison oak, which is common in the Verdugo Mountains.In contrast, all the goats need is water, mineral and salt blocks, and a large Anatolian shepherd dog to ward off coyotes. They can also climb up steep mountainsides, eat the poison oak and work under the blazing sun without suffering from heat stress or heat exhaustion.Targeted grazing is just one of many tools to fight wildfiresLynn Huntsinger, a professor of rangeland ecology and management at the University of California, Berkeley, noted targeted grazing works best when it's used in combination with other wildfire reduction measures, especially prescribed burning.""In an ideal world, we would have used goats or sheep or even cows, after the big fires we've had in recent years,"" Huntsinger told NPR.That would have had the greatest impact in eliminating noxious and invasive plants, because the animals would consume any regrowth of the unwanted vegetation, she explained.And even in places where there has not been a fire, regular grazing routines over time can eventually exhaust the root stock, preventing them from resurfacing and permanently changing the biomass of the space. That's for the better, according to Huntsinger.She added: ""When we think about wildfire risk reduction and good land management, we need to be thinking like artists, using a wide palette of all of the tools at our disposal.""Back in Glendale, Choi said he's proud to be a part of the effort to make California's urban and rural communities safer.Reaching down to caress the head of an insistent 7-month-old goat rubbing up against his leg, Choi took in the fire break visible from the bottom of the mountain.""That line right there could save these houses. It could help save lives. It could give firefighters just enough time to save the people in this community,"" he said.

333,Florida lawmakers want to use radioactive material to pave roads,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/09/florida-lawmakers-want-to-use-radioactive-material-to-pave-roads,Roads in Florida could soon include phosphogypsum — a radioactive waste material from the fertilizer industry — under a bill lawmakers have sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis.,"Roads in Florida could soon include phosphogypsum — a radioactive waste material from the fertilizer industry — under a bill lawmakers have sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis.Conservation groups are urging DeSantis to veto the bill, saying phosphogypsum would hurt water quality and put road construction crews at a higher risk of cancer.Here's what to know about the law and about phosphogypsum.What would the law do, specifically?HB 1191 would compel the Florida Transportation Department to study using phosphogypsum in paving projects, calling for ""demonstration projects using phosphogypsum in road construction aggregate material to determine its feasibility as a paving material.""If it's approved, phosphogypsum would join pavement aggregates such as crushed stone, gravel and sand. In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration says, industrial byproducts and reclaimed materials have also been used as aggregates.The bill sets a deadline of April 1, 2024, giving the transportation agency less than a year to complete its work and make a recommendation. The Republican-dominated Florida Legislature approved the measure by a wide margin.What is phosphogypsum and why is there so much of it?In fertilizer, phosphorus is particularly important for plants to have strong roots and for crops to be productive. Florida has been an important source since the 1800s; today, the EPA notes, ""Florida alone accounts for approximately 80 percent of the current capacity, making it the world's largest phosphate producing area.""When phosphate rock is dissolved in sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid for fertilizer and a few other uses, phosphogypsum is what's left over.The commonly used production process, which dates to the 1840s, is not very efficient. For every ton of phosphoric acid produced, more than 5 tons of phosphogypsum waste is generated.Florida's prominent role means the state also has massive waste sites called phosphogypsum stacks, or ""gypstacks."" Such stacks can be very large — spanning up to 800 acres and about 200 feet in height. They've been linked to serious problems over the years, due to sinkholes and other breaches.Is it dangerous?""Phosphogypsum contains appreciable quantities of uranium and its decay products, such as radium-226,"" according to the EPA. And because the fertilizer production process concentrates waste material, ""phosphogypsum is more radioactive than the original phosphate rock,"" the agency notes.""The radium is of particular concern because it decays to form radon, a cancer-causing, radioactive gas,"" the EPA adds.An analysis commissioned by the Fertilizer Institute, a group that represents the fertilizer industry, disagrees, saying that using phosphogypsum in road construction won't produce radioactive doses that are above the EPA's acceptable risks. Such work, it stated, ""can be done safely and results in doses that are a small fraction of those arising from natural background radiation.""Last November, researchers in China who reviewed numerous existing studies on recycling phosphogypsum said they were optimistic about its potential use in road construction materials. But they concluded that more studies are needed, noting that ""few studies have focused on its durability or analyzed its long-term effects on soil and water resources.""Critics of the new legislation are urging DeSantis to use his veto power.""Using radioactive phosphogypsum in roads is not a solution to the fertilizer industry's toxic waste problem,"" the Center for Biological Diversity and more than 30 other groups said in a letter to the governor. ""Florida should not be a test subject in the industry's reckless experiment.""The groups say the fertilizer industry has already shown it can't adequately manage more than 1 billion tons of waste currently stored in Florida.Is Florida's plan legal?The EPA states that ""phosphogypsum remains prohibited from use in road construction,"" as it has been almost continuously for more than 30 years.Under former President Donald Trump, the EPA briefly rescinded that policy starting in October 2020. But it reinstated the rule in June 2021.The Florida legislation doesn't address the federal prohibition outright, saying that phosphogypsum can be used as an aggregate material ""in accordance with the conditions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency approval for the use."" Its supporting documents also note that the EPA allows some uses for research purposes — and it asserts that phosphogypsum is not technically a ""solid waste.""When contacted by NPR to comment on Florida's plan, the EPA did not immediately supply a statement. What's next?DeSantis could sign the phosphogypsum road-test measure into law at any time; it he takes no action, the bill will be enacted automatically.

4073,Bruce Marks wants you to buy — or build — a home,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/09/bruce-marks-wants-you-to-buy-or-build-a-home,A new initiative from NACA will help residents own their own pre-fab homes.,"Bruce Marks has already been a “disruptive force” for mortgages. Now, he’s targeting the construction of new housing with what he calls the “one-dollar program.”“We want to be — and are becoming — the disruptive force on the homeownership on the new construction side,” said Marks, CEO of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit homeownership organization that has helped tens of thousands of people secure mortgages. Marks has made headlines for more than a decade for NACA’s innovative approach to lending. He’s building on the longstanding initiative to get mortgages in the hands of people often excluded by banks with the budding new construction program — plus, a mapping project to educate and empower residents across the commonwealth to learn: who owns Massachusetts?He attributed his success in mortgages to “respect for the homebuyers” in a Boston Public Radio appearance Monday. NACA uses different criteria than traditional banks to evaluate whether people will meet their mortgage payments, doesn’t ask for down payments or closing costs, and offers a fixed-rate mortgage. “The secret sauce is the underwriting where you don’t look so much at the credit score. You look at the payments that they control,” Marks said. “And we get the job done.”NACA has helped provide over 75,000 mortgages and has a low foreclosure rate — about a hundreth of a percent. And the vast majority of NACA’s homebuyers are people of color.“We have respect for the homebuyers,” Marks said, explaining the organization’s success. “So we put them through the counseling. So we do the financial management counseling, so it’s comprehensive.”The concept of no–down payment mortgages in the United States goes back nearly a century, Marks said, to mortgages guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program was established in 1944 to provide assistance to veterans returning from overseas.“What built the white middle class after World War II? It was the no–down payment, VA mortgage,” he said. “So the concept is not new, but we put people through that counseling where they can know where they’re spending their money and they can adjust their spending.”With its new “one-dollar program,” the organization hopes that people can buy vacant lots or foreclosed properties from their city or town for a low price. Then, they can put a low-cost but durable pre-fabricated home on the property. He says that it was inspired by the clear dearth of available housing. Marks recalled that, a few months ago, NACA went into rural communities in Alabama to educate residents on their homebuyer programs, communities that he says are “really overlooked by the government.” “That’s where the new construction came from. Because you look at these communities — they need the new construction, they need the rehab,” he said. So far, NACA has built one home as a model but expects to soon build 500 to 1,000 each year. Marks is also working on a new mapping project, devoted to answering the question: Who owns Massachusetts? With funding from the Lynch Family Foundation, he’s looking at land records of the more than 2.5 million properties in Massachusetts to see who’s buying up the commonwealth’s homes. “Who are the outside investors? Who are the multi-investors out there who are really going after these properties and buying properties, particularly in the minority communities, and renting them out with no intention, really, of selling them to homebuyers? So they are destroying and stealing the dream of affordable homeownership. And then you can see the public housing out there that is really essential.”So far, Marks said that he has shared the map with officials including Massachusetts Auditor Diana DiZoglio and Lieutenant Gov. Kim Driscoll. “This is a tool — not just for them, but for the community residents out there,” he said. The color-coded map will plainly show viewers who owns every single property in the state. “To give them the tools to see: who owns the properties in their neighborhood?”",Local,"Tue, 09 May 2023 15:31:24 EST",87d85caf4d4ee75df88b02eb4a22d623

Large infestations may put lots of the blood-sucking insects or their droppings on obvious display, but eggs or freshly-hatched nymphal bedbugs are less easy to see. They may also be lying low in hidden areas of a piece of furniture, such as seams, crevices or even the inside.""At low levels, bedbugs are sometimes hard to detect, and so you may not even realize that you have a bedbug problem until the bedbugs that you've brought in with that couch have kind of blossomed into a full-blown infestation, maybe even in multiple rooms,"" he said.Fredericks, who is also a board-certified entomologist, said it's possible to get bedbugs out of a piece of second-hand furniture with vacuuming, steaming and thorough cleaning. But miss just a few, and you could be in trouble.""If there's a hundred bedbugs on this couch and you kill 90%, you still have 10 bedbugs, and that's enough to start a new infestation.""Some people who find bedbugs in their beds think they can just sleep on the couch for a while, Fredericks said, but bedbugs can walk and will follow you to another room.Forgetting about the piece of furniture for a while to try to wait them out also won't work, since bedbugs — which he referred to as ""little, six-legged vampires"" — go into a state of dormancy in the absence of food.""Bedbugs are known to be able to live for more than six months without a blood meal,"" he said. ""So by trying to just starve the bedbugs, what you wind up with are just really hungry bedbugs when you return to that spot.""Fredericks says it might be best to just skip that piece of second-hand furniture. But if you absolutely must have it, he recommends exercising extreme caution and calling a pest control expert.

4744,Senate confirms first Hispanic judge to Massachusetts federal court,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/senate-confirms-first-hispanic-judge-to-massachusetts-federal-court,Ayer Judge Margaret R. Guzman will join the federal bench.,"Margaret R. Guzman, a former public defender, will be the first Hispanic judge to sit on the federal U.S. District Court for Massachusetts. The U.S. Senate voted 49-48 Thursday to confirm Guzman, a state court judge, to the seat. Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie vote which split along party lines. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican and former governor of Massachusetts, voted against the nomination. Guzman, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Biden last July, is a graduate of Clark University in Worcester, and the Boston University School of Law.She previously worked for the Committee for Public Counsel Services in Worcester from 1992 until 2005. Guzman went entered general law independent practice in 2005, working until her 2009 nomination to the Massachusetts Trial Court by then-Governor Deval Patrick. As an Associate Justice from 2009 to 2017, Guzman presided over criminal and civil matters in half of the state’s District Courts. She has served as the first justice for the Ayer District Court since 2017.In floor remarks before the vote, Senator Ed Markey pointed to Guzman’s varied legal experience.“Judge Guzman will therefore bring to the federal bench not only the knowledge and experience of a state court judge who has presided over more than 1000 cases in her career that have gone to judgment, but the wisdom of a public defender and solo practitioner, joining together precisely the kind of professional legal diversity that the Biden administration has made a priority and that the federal judiciary badly needs,” Markey said.Carl Tobias, Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond said Guzman’s confirmation represents “a perfect example” of the Biden administration’s effort to diversify the federal courts.“That is unusual and that’s not a typical profile that you would’ve seen historically,” Tobias said when asked about Guzman’s work history.Ultimately, Tobias added, experiential diversity – the types of legal practice a nominee has engaged in – add positively to a court’s expertise.“You want a federal judiciary that reflect the people who come into court,” he said. “I think she, by virtue of her own experience, but also the people she’s represented, will have a better sense than many judge would have of the types of people who will be in her federal court room.” Other elected officials, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, praised Guzman’s confirmation. “Judge Guzman has an exceptional understanding of our entire justice system with roots in the Worcester legal community as a public defender and deep expertise as a Massachusetts trial court judge – and today, she is making history as the first Hispanic judge to serve on the District Court in Massachusetts,” Warren said in a statement.Judge Guzman deferred requests for comment Wednesday to the White House.",Politics,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 17:55:35 EST",4440325ad2feab35aa246417dfc10468

Some households will see a cut of $250 a month or more, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research institute. ""This is a change that will increase hardship for many individuals and families, especially given the modest amount of regular SNAP benefits, which are only about $6 per person per day, on average,"" says Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy for the institute.More than 40 million people in the U.S. are helped out each month by SNAP. Some states had already phased out the pandemic assistance, and the remaining 32 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands issued their last emergency benefits in February.The cut in SNAP benefits comes as food prices continue to rise. Carlis Phares who is 64 and lives in Columbus, Ohio calls it a double whammy.""It's going to be a lot harder,"" Phares says.Social security is her main source of income, and while those payments include a cost of living adjustment, it hasn't kept up with the increase in rent and other expenses, Phares says. The pandemic boost in SNAP allotments helped her eat well and preserve her Social Security money for other things. Now she'll have to do more with less.""I'm going to figure out how to make it stretch,"" Phares says. One strategy to save money is to cut back on meat and fresh produce and stock up on cheaper foods, such as crackers, bread and rice, she says. But Phares knows this isn't good for her. ""The cheapest stuff is the less healthy stuff,"" Phares says. ""I learned that, because I gained a lot of weight eating on the cheaper stuff — the starches, the crackers. And now that I've gotten myself to a better weight, I'm going to have to figure that out,"" she says.Rosenbaum says the annual cost-of-living increase built into SNAP will help ""soften"" the blow from the cut in emergency allotments. In addition, a re-evaluation of benefits in 2021 aimed at making nutritious foods more affordable led to a bump in payments, which also partially offsets the cuts. Even so, in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, nearly 9.5 million older adults, ages 50 and up, were considered ""food insecure"", meaning they sometimes struggled to afford all the food they needed, according to an AARP analysis. In addition, an estimated 9 million children live in food insecure homes, according to No Kid Hungry, a nonprofit group that works to end hunger. Overall, about 10% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in 2021. ""SNAP remains our most powerful tool for combating hunger,"" Rosenbaum says. ""It's found to be linked to improved health, education and economic outcomes and to lower medical costs,"" she says.This year, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill re-authorize the farm bill, which includes a review of the SNAP program, advocates say there's an opportunity to strengthen the program, especially at a time when diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are on the rise. A recent CDC report found 1 in 2 young children in the U.S. don't eat a daily vegetable, but most consume plenty of sugary drinks. And about 1 in 5 children in the U.S. have obesity. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force recommends strengthening food and nutrition security through the farm bill, including expanding the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program that gives SNAP recipients more money to buy fruits and vegetables.This is similar to the Double Up Food Bucks program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which doubles the value of SNAP benefits when used to buy produce at farmers markets and other venues. Another idea is to strengthen standards for retailers to encourage a wider variety of nutritious foods in stores.The farm bill, which is typically re-authorized every five years, is set to expire at the end of September. It's a massive piece of legislation that governs everything from agriculture subsidies to nutrition programs, including SNAP. ""[We're] looking at the farm bill as anti-hunger legislation,"" says Eric Mitchell, executive director of the Alliance to End Hunger. Mitchell says there's lots of momentum — from a wide variety of groups, policymakers to healthcare organizations — to scale up programs that can be beneficial. Mitchell points to a couple of examples: ""Being able to use SNAP benefits at your local farmers markets, as well as creating food pharmacies where you can use your SNAP benefits to purchase healthy foods to help improve your health outcomes.""In the meantime there are still many people in need. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective, Ohio's largest food bank, has seen an increase in the need for its services even before the emergency benefits ran out.Carlis Phares says with a reduced benefit she'll have to rely on some basics from the food bank. ""I think there's going to be a whole lot of people going to the food banks,"" she says. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:01:00 EST",dd84c05b6f1cef5b0b3a9f76db44677d

Most tour guides will tell you that the British soldiers who shot the men were largely acquitted (two were found guilty of manslaughter, punished with a branding and released).What is not often told during those tours: The soldiers who killed protester Crispus Attucks were acquitted of murder in part because their defense attorney — future president John Adams — argued that Attucks, a 6-foot, 2-inch tall Black man who was carrying a stick at the time, “was a stout fellow whose very looks were enough to terrify any person.”Attucks is generally described as a man of mixed race, the first killed in the Boston Massacre and who was buried in Granary Cemetery beneath a stone commemorating the clash. But there is seldom mention that Attucks was once enslaved.An 1887 history of the town of Framingham, where Attucks was born, says that he was “probably a descendant of John Auttuck, an Indian,” whose family probably “intermarried with Negroes who were slaves.” Other accounts point more clearly to Attuck's parents as Prince Yonger, an enslaved man from Africa, and Nancy Attucks, an Indigenous woman.Attucks was enslaved by Deacon William Brown of Framingham, who in 1750 took out an ad in the Boston Gazette offering a reward for the return of the ""run-away"" to his ""master.""Few other details about his life are known. Historians believe he changed his name to Michael Johnson to avoid capture, and that he spent the next couple decades working as a sailor.Boston now officially recognizes March 5 as Crispus Attucks Day.

3998,Spring has arrived. Here's when to plant food and flowers in the garden.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/spring-has-arrived-heres-when-to-plant-food-and-flowers-in-the-garden,Local garden experts are waiting just a bit longer.,"Spring is here, which means farm workers at the Haley House Thornton Street Urban Farm and Community Gardens are looking at seeds. “It is the first day of spring, and we are plotting and planning what we're going to be growing this season,” said Jay Vilar, program director at the Haley House. “A lot of the work that we're doing now is about just getting ready for the season. So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.""Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil. “What we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,” Vilar said. Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury. “In order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,” he said. Most produce won’t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said. “Typically when you start to put things into the ground and it’s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,” he said. “There are things that you can start early on — like peas — that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.” Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said. The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens. Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant — but not quite yet. Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners of Pemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont, said now’s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go. “We’re itching to get outside,” he said. “We are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale — all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost — so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.”Though most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold. “I appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,” he said. “This will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.”Most local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs — tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few — that will be ready to go into the ground. “Pansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,” Saidnawey said. “They'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.”Perennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: “Hellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.”Trees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it’s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.“By the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,” he said. It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens. “If you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,” Saidnawey said. “So it’s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.” People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said. Leftover containers from last season are still just fine, Saidnawey said. They may need some fresh soil, a bit of compost and new plants.“One of the greatest joys is to watch people walk into this place with a smile on their face,” Saidnawey said. “I mean, if you're walking into a plant store without a smile on your face, something's wrong.”",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 17:34:14 EST",9c7e6631b03c6a3d35685498e7b58eec

They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center — and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose: As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff. While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university. In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022. Rath: In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose: We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction — or lack thereof — with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus. We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role — whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development — just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions. Rath: Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose: Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them. Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind. Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers. We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students. Rath: Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose: In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, ""OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?"" Rath: What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty? Rose: In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those. So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, ""OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?""There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great.",Education,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 17:37:21 EST",26a319d1db667ea77f3953fb56f10fca
7484,Program to recruit more nurses of color in Boston gets $20M boost,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/20/program-to-recruit-more-nurses-of-color-in-boston-gets-20m-boost,UMass Boston and Mass General Brigham leaders say hundreds of nurses from underrepresented communities can help reduce health inequities.,"A program aimed at recruiting and retaining more nurses of color in the Greater Boston region has received a $20 million boost in funding from its overseeing organizations.The Clinical Leadership Collaborative for Diversity in Nursing program at UMass Boston, a collaboration between the college and Mass General Brigham, has offered financial and mentoring support to around nine students each year since it started in 2008. With this increased funding, the program now plans to support about 400 students over the next five years in order to address inequities and further diversify the nursing workforce.Gaurdia Bannister, executive director of the Institute for Patient Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said nurses are in a unique position to improve patients' health outcomes because they spend more time with patients than other clinical staff. And she says being a nurse of color or bringing a particular cultural competence can “really help move the dial” on long-standing and worsening health inequities in Massachusetts.“And I can tell you, these students are extraordinary,” Bannister said. “They are so passionate about wanting to become nurses and have overcome challenges. ... Sometimes these students may be a little bit older, so they have families that they need to take care of. Some of them are immigrants. They're committed, though, to staying.”Lindsey Desameau, who graduated from UMass Boston’s nursing school in May and will soon be working at Brigham Women’s Hospital, received three semesters of tuition assistance and stipends amounting to around $17,000. She was also assigned an experienced nurse mentor who, like her, is Haitian American. She recognizes how her background can help patients.“I've even had doctors come up to me and knowing that I speak Haitian Creole say ‘Can you come in and translate for us and kind of have that small talk with the patient?’ And it's been a tremendous change for that patient,” said Desameau. UMass Boston Chancellor Marcelo Suárez-Orozco told GBH News the increased funding for the program, to support more students like Desameau, will be transformational.“Nursing is the vertebrae of our healthcare system,” he said. “So we need to address nursing shortages. We need to improve patient care. Nurses are at the forefront of cost effectiveness, health promotion, prevention and really adapting to the evolving needs of the patient population.”Katie Murphy, the president of the Massachusetts Nursing Association, said she is concerned about nursing shortages in the state, but believes that working conditions, including staff-to-patient ratios that her union feels are too low, have caused nurses to leave Massachusetts after graduating.“From our point of view, I mean, if you look at the numbers on the Board of Registration’s nursing website, we have more nurses today than we did before the pandemic,” Murphy said. “We’re graduating nurses all over the state, a couple of thousand every year. So we don't have a nursing shortage. We really don't. But we have nurses that are not willing to work under these circumstances.”Murphy also agreed increased diversity is important for both patients and providers, but that ""we have a long way to go."" Out of the Massachusetts Nursing Association's more than 22,000 members, a recent internal survey showed about 90% are white, compared to just around 70% in the state population on the whole.Murphy said one factor in that discrepancy may be the cost and time it takes to obtain a nursing degree. There are some associate degrees, but she said a bachelor's degree is effectively required for nurses who want to find work in higher-paying hospitals.“Getting a nursing degree is expensive; and I think that that kind of reflects the systemic racism in our society as a whole.” said Murphy. “Who has the wherewithal, who's got that generational wealth to pay?”UMass Boston’s nursing school said of its approximately 1,800 current students, 20% are Black, 14% Latinx, and 13% Asian — which is close to the racial and ethnic makeup of Boston. Mass General Brigham couldn’t share demographic data on its nursing staff, but did say that 34% of its almost 86,000 total employees are non-white, with around 11% of them being Asian, 11% Black and about 10% being Hispanic.Suárez-Orozco said the investment in this nursing program and the fact most UMass Boston students stay in the area will further diversify the state's nursing workforce. He said that five years after graduation, more than 80% of all UMass Boston students are still working in Massachusetts.“The number of students from other universities that stay here in Boston is minuscule compared to our demographic,” Suárez-Orozco said. “Our bet here is that the fact that the hospitals are reaching out to us to create this partnership around like-minded approaches to the training of the next generation of nurses will prove an enduring investment in our health care, in our patient population, and the [residents] of Boston and the commonwealth.”",Local,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 13:45:21 EST",ee07bb16684ef0a9c3b9ee9e2f4ae4b7
3207,Mass. facing shortages of home health aides and doctors for people with Alzheimer's,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/15/mass-facing-shortages-of-home-health-aides-and-doctors-for-people-with-alzheimers,"30,000 more care aides will be needed by the end of the decade to care for Massachusetts seniors, says the Alzheimer’s Association.","Massachusetts will need to find another 30,000 home health aides and personal care aides to support the increase in Alzheimer’s patients expected by the end of the decade, according to the latest yearly report from the Alzheimer’s Association released Wednesday. The latest data show there are about 110,000 home health aides and personal care aides in the state, and about twice as many unpaid caregivers supporting this growing population. Jim Wessler, the CEO for the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, said that almost 30% increased need for aides by 2030 comes on top of a current staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when a number of long-term care workers left the profession.“Some of them just decided, ‘I'm not going to do this anymore,’ because it was just too overwhelming, and they have their own families they have to take care of,” Wessler said. “So we have critical shortages today in nursing homes and assisted living. And we see that with hospitals having patients backed up that they can't place in long-term care facilities because long-term care facilities don't have beds, because they don't have enough staffing.”The report also projects that by 2050, Massachusetts will need 1,042 geriatricians — primary care doctors with additional specialized training to treat older patients — to serve 30% of its residents who will be 65 and older, regardless of whether they have dementia or not. At last count in 2021, there were only 214 geriatricians in the state.Wessler added that, right now, Massachusetts is facing “a really dramatic shortage of specialists like neurologists and geriatricians in particular.”Anastasia Canell, a doctoral candidate in counseling psychology with a focus in geriatrics at Lehigh University who is doing her residency in Massachusetts, recognizes the need for more specialists from her own experiences. Her grandmother had risk factors for vascular dementia but was not diagnosed until after the family noticed behavioral changes and contacted a neurologist. Now she wants to normalize the process for other families.“I honestly think about that every time before I go into a room with the family,” said Canell, who also does legislative advocacy work with the Alzheimer’s Association in the state. “I think about what would my family have needed in this moment? What would my family have benefited from? What kind of person would make this experience more comfortable?”Wessler said addressing the doctor shortage is particularly urgent with the recent accelerated approval by the FDA in January of lecanemab, only the second drug the agency has approved to treat Alzheimer’s. If the medication is approved for Medicare coverage, doctors anticipate a rush in demand. Wessler said the Massachusetts/New Hampshire chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association has a medical scientific advisory committee of specialists, including geriatricians, neurologists, neuropsychologists, from most of the major teaching hospitals in the state who have been meeting to prepare.“How are they going to handle what they anticipate will be an influx of demand for people to know if they're eligible for the treatment?” Wessler said. “And then another part of that is, how are we making sure that there is equity involved with this so that underserved communities are also getting access to the latest in treatment?”Wessler said equity is deeply embedded in diagnosis, treatment and outcomes with regard to Alzheimer’s. He said national statistics show that African American people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's and dementia as white people, and that Latino people are about one and a half times more likely to be diagnosed. He added that some of that increased risk is correlated to the disproportionate impact of heart disease in those communities.In Massachusetts, Wessler said his organization is working with several Community Health Centers to increase access to specialists, care aides and treatment for people of color and those with lower incomes.Equity is also an issue when it comes to meeting the projected needed increase of tens of thousands of care aides in Massachusetts.Marlishia Aho is the regional communications manager of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, a union representing over 80,000 health care and home care workers in the state. She echoed Wessler’s perspective on the effects of the pandemic on the shortage of care workers “It has only exacerbated the shortage,” Aho said. “Prior to the pandemic, we have seen that certified nursing aides were leaving the field because they were — as majority women, and women of color and immigrants who weren't paid fairly — seen as essential, but their wages and benefits didn’t mirror that.”Aho said, as of April 1, 58,000 personal care attendants they represent who are paid through MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, will be making $18 an hour, which works out to less than $38,000 a year. And she said, with the healthcare industry “just churning through workers,” she’s skeptical that finding another 30,000 care aides to enter the field by 2030 is a reachable goal.“Is it feasible? Not where we are currently,” Aho said. “Not with the wages we are providing to caregivers, but if we continue to invest in caregivers and listen to them, ensure they have a seat at the table, I think it is doable. But we have to value these roles because they are essential.”Aho added that recruiting and retaining care aides for those with dementia has a multiplying effect.“They allow other work to happen. So if I have someone caring for my elderly father, I am able to go out into the world and work. And so we have to think about it makes other work possible.”",Local,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 05:00:43 EST",2e6e127dafedeb515c8bf96e4926a57f
7152,AG Campbell says credit card companies can help fight gun violence,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/24/ag-campbell-says-credit-card-companies-can-help-fight-gun-violence,Campbell talked gun safety and sports-betting ads in a Boston Public Radio interview.,"While Attorney General Andrea Campbell works to set up a new gun law enforcement unit in her office, she’s also calling on credit card companies to play a role in combating gun violence. Last week, Campbell joined 13 attorneys general from other states in sending a letter to the four major credit card companies, urging them to help “disrupt” gun violence. Visa, American Express, MasterCard and Discover earlier this month announced a pause on plans to adopt a new code distinctly categorizing sales at gun stores, a feature supporters say would help flag suspicious purchases made with credit cards. The AGs’ letter argues that merchant category codes are routine and that political pushback from other states should not impede the move. “If you can track us going to Walmart and buying milk, why not guns? Which gives law enforcement critical tools to not only look at where people are buying, if gun hoarding is happening, but also if someone illegally purchased a weapon and used it in some horrific crime, law enforcement can go after them and hold them accountable,” Campbell said on Boston Public Radio Friday. The attorney general announced plans to create a gun safety unit at her inauguration in January. She said Friday that she’s starting an internal working group and reaching out to law enforcement as she develops both the gun unit and a police accountability unit. She described the gun enforcement unit as a one-stop shop within her office for sharing best practices around issues like firearm trafficking and the manufacturing of so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons assembled from parts that are often bought online or made with 3-D printers. “We have folks in our state police unit that are doing trainings every day with local law enforcement,” Campbell said. “We need legislative solutions, as well, to keep folks from being able to manufacture these weapons in Massachusetts and sell them. In addition, this same unit can also address gun violence in the community and make sure that survivors are getting the resources they need.” Campbell is not alone in eyeing legislative action on guns. Gov. Maura Healey supports legislation banning ghost guns, and House Speaker Ron Mariano has said he wants to work this session on further strengthening the state’s gun laws. Next Thursday, volunteers from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense plan to visit the State House to lobby for what they describe as comprehensive gun safety legislation. Campbell also touched on the deluge of sports-betting ads now that the industry is up and running in Massachusetts. Campbell said she doesn’t plan to stand in the way of the sports-betting law passed last summer, but that her office wants to protect consumers, particularly young people. She’s been in communication with the state Gaming Commission as its members develop regulations, and said she wants there to be guardrails that prevent athletes, influencers and experts from making money by recommending particular wagers. “They shouldn’t get paid, for example, for encouraging you to place a certain bet that will likely lose and get a percentage of those losses,” Campbell said.",Politics,"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 16:39:39 EST",6c489a618f6cb4bde2374211507bad67
6420,NBC’s Chuck Todd: Trump will win 2024 Republican nomination,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/24/nbcs-chuck-todd-trump-will-win-2024-republican-nomination,"An “impressive show of influential bullying power” over the last week shows Trump still holds sway over top politicians, Todd says.","Days after former President Donald Trump claimed he was going to be arrested over his hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, it still hasn’t happened. NBC’s political director Chuck Todd says that’s part of the former president’s “media savvy” when it comes to legal trouble. “Donald Trump manufactured a story and most people fell for it,” Todd said on GBH’s Boston Public Radio Thursday. “And it [the arrest] wasn’t nearly as close as everybody made it seem. It’s really frustrating to watch this when you know what he’s doing, you see it happening in real time.” The scandal results from adult film star Daniels’ plans to sell her story about a 2006 affair with Trump, a relationship that Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied. Manhattan prosecutors are investigating a potentially illegal $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep the story quiet in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Indicting a former president would be unprecedented in the nation’s history. Trump turned to social media over the weekend to tell his supporters to protest his arrest, which he said would happen Tuesday. “One thing he is is media savvy about his legal problems,” Todd said, pointing to multiple criminal investigations the former president is staring down. “The entire premise of Donald Trump’s existence is about escaping a legal problem. That’s how he has lived his life for the last 40 years, starting with the bankruptcies.”But for Todd, the uproar over Trump’s apparently imminent arrest did prove one thing. “If he is living and breathing — and running — he is going to win this nomination,” Todd predicted. He pointed to Republican politicians who questioned the legitimacy of the investigation into the former president. Florida governor and likely 2024 campaign rival Ron DeSantis insulted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over a “manufactured circus,” and three House Republicans demanded that Bragg disclose documents detailing his criminal investigation. “This was a fascinating power play by Trump,” Todd said. “For a man who is politically extraordinarily weak with the middle of the electorate ... it was an impressive show of influential bullying power.” Who holds sway in the 2024 election is already top of mind on both sides of the aisle. Some are casting doubt on Vice President Kamala Harris’ political power and whether she should be on the Democratic ticket again in 2024. Looking back on the 2020 Democratic primary that catapulted Harris into the spotlight, Todd said she blemished her credibility by being inconsistent on the issues — most infamously, on Medicare for All. “She didn’t know whether she was going to run as a progressive or run as a moderate. And she was struggling. She was trying to run in both lanes,” Todd said. “Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, knows exactly who she is,” he continued. “I think Elizabeth Warren’s problem as a candidate was: she came across as inaccessible. ... It very much felt like she was a podium candidate, and she was a lecturer, rather than in the middle of it all.” After voters elected two of the oldest-ever presidents in Trump and Biden, Todd thinks that age would be a problem for Warren if she tried to run for president in 2028, following Biden’s reelection campaign in 2024. Warren would be 79 years old during the 2028 general election. “It may punish her, fairly or unfairly,” the “Meet the Press” host said. “One thing you can count on America doing is overcorrecting on these things. If you told me in the next 10 years we elect two of our youngest presidents in the last 50 years or so, it wouldn’t shock me.”",Local,"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 12:07:49 EST",8cac9345fe01342e8e19eaf8206cb811

Dominick Pangallo, a former mayoral chief of staff, and former Salem Mayor Neil Harrington finished Tuesday’s race with a comfortable margin over the three other candidates. Whoever emerges as the winner in the final election on May 16, it’ll be the first time a new mayor is elected in Salem since 2005. Former Mayor Kim Driscoll stepped away from her fifth term when she was sworn in as Massachusetts’ lieutenant governor in January.Pangallo, who served as former Mayor Kim Driscoll’s chief of staff up until January 2022, said he’s thrilled by the outcome of the preliminary election. He collected more than 40% of the vote, the highest among the candidates, according to unofficial results released by the city. “It’s a pivotal moment for Salem, and I feel strongly that we can’t go backwards,” he told GBH News Wednesday. “We have a strong foundation to build on and keep moving our city forward as a place that works for everyone.”Harrington, who served as Salem’s mayor from 1990 to 1997, did not respond to GBH News’ requests for comment. He took in nearly a third of the vote, per the unofficial tally, and is running on preserving Salem’s economic future as well as keeping Salem’s Peabody Essex Museum from moving to Boston. Pangallo said some of the top issues facing Salem are affordability and housing. He also wants to smooth the transition with new projects coming to the city, making sure that the city benefits from the new jobs an in-development offshore wind terminal while managing the project’s impact on surrounding neighborhoods. Former City Councilor Stephen Dibble finished third with 14% of the vote, acting Mayor and Ward 5 City Councilor Robert McCarthy was fourth with 8%, and activist Stacia Kraft came in fifth with just under 3% at 188 votes.Kraft tells GBH News that she “went into the race with no illusions” and said there are crucial issues that she hopes remain potent for the final election. “We have nine planned developments for our flood zones and Salem is only eight square miles. And we now are moving towards privatizing the Salem Housing Authority,” she said. “So giving over our elderly and disabled residents to for-profit corporations, these are two very big issues.”Kraft was the only candidate without a political background. Pangallo attributes his win in the preliminary election to a strong field campaign, having knocked on almost 5,000 doors. He said that kind of grassroots effort is what helped him win 11 of the 14 precincts in Salem and he hopes will give him victory in May.“I feel like the results in that preliminary election were a strong indication that our community is one that wants to keep moving forward as a place that's innovative and professionally managed.”Campaign finance reports show both Pangallo and Harrington spent tens of thousands of dollars on the race. Pangallo spent nearly $28,000 since the beginning of November, while Harrington spent nearly $46,000. Both Pangallo and Harrington outspent the other candidates at least four times over.As of the end of February, Pangallo had just over $42,000 cash on hand, closely matched by Harrington’s nearly $41,000.",Local,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:01:24 EST",17816d27022ee9ef1ab11a84952f3aa7

""I can never repay them, but I can support them and be there if they ask.""Seller was among several hundred people who attended Boston MedFlight's annual patient reunion, which was held this Sunday for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was a chance for people who needed emergency transport to meet with the pilot and medical team who got them to treatment.

""You know, they probably get hugs all the time from former patients, but it's all I have to give, really,"" she said. ""And I thought about it a lot, and I thought of all the things that I've had in my life. I've been through cancer and a couple of other things.

""All they care about are ratings and revenue.""Fox has not explained the reasoning behind Carlson's dismissal, which came a week after it settled a high-profile lawsuit with the election-tech company Dominion Voting Systems. The network also fired Carlson's executive producer, Justin Wells.Both Carlson and Wells are named as individual defendants in an ongoing lawsuit against the network by Grossberg, who is suing the network for gender and religious discrimination, as well as unequal pay and failing to accommodate disabilities in federal court in New York.In her original suit, Grossberg describes an environment at Fox News that ""subjugates women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasts religious minorities and belittles their traditions, and demonstrates little to no regard for those suffering from mental illness.""Grossberg said her complaints about abuse were dismissed.""I ultimately went and complained to one of my supervisors about the abuse and the bullying and the gaslighting and misogyny that I was putting up with at Tucker,"" Grossberg said. ""And his response to me was, 'We're just following Tucker's tone. That's Tucker's tone.' And I do really believe that it all trickles down from the top.""When asked if she blames Carlson for the toxic environment, Grossberg said that she does. ""It's his show,"" she said.""Fox News engaged an independent outside counsel to immediately investigate the concerns raised by Ms. Grossberg, which were made following a critical performance review,"" according to a statement from a Fox News spokesperson.Grossberg filed her original suit in March; the network fired her days after.Grossberg, who is Jewish, also alleges in her lawsuit that her and other Jewish colleagues were ridiculed for observing traditional holidays and that the network tokenized employees and gave them diversity awards.At Carlson's show, male colleagues regularly made comments that were demeaning to women, according to Grossberg. ""There were conversations that women who had tattoos or piercings or colored hair were disgusting,"" Grossberg told NPR's Leila Fadel.Before joining the team, Grossberg said she thought Carlson's racist and misogynistic remarks were all for show.""I was hopeful that maybe there was a kinder person behind the on-air persona,"" Grossberg told Fadel, ""but unfortunately, it's quite the reverse.""""What's being said in the office by his team and also his lieutenants who are carrying out his orders is very consistent with what ends up on the air and what the public sees,"" said Grossberg.In a brief statement issued Monday morning, the network announced it had ""agreed to part ways"" with Carlson, who had been widely considered to be the face of the Fox News brand.Speaking publicly for the first time since his firing, Carlson posted a vague two-minute video to Twitter on Wednesday night.""True things prevail,"" he said in the video. ""Where can you still find Americans saying true things? There aren't many places left, but there are some, and that's enough. As long as you can hear the words, there is hope. See you soon.""In response to a question about Grossberg's allegations, Carlson told NPR, ""I know nothing about her. I never met her."" Indeed, Grossberg told NPR's Leila Fadel that Carlson mostly worked from Maine or Florida, ""where he doesn't have to take accountability for what he says on air or what goes on in the office. And I think that's very deliberate. And he has three men that carry out his orders and make sure that we do follow.""Grossberg said she was ""in disbelief"" when she heard that Carlson had been fired.""Obviously I'm at the center of this with two suits that he's named in. And I also endured a very abusive atmosphere in his office. So feelings were mixed. It went from being very excited to, you know, that there was some justice to also not wanting anybody to be hurt that was there that had lost their jobs,"" she said.Grossberg says Fox attorneys pressured her to lie in Dominion caseIn a separate suit filed in Delaware, Grossberg is suing the network and individual attorneys for allegedly setting her up to take the blame, along with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, for broadcasting the falsehoods about election fraud in 2020 that were at the heart of Dominion's defamation case against Fox. Grossberg alleges that Fox attorneys pressured her to lie under oath in order to downplay the misogyny she says is rampant at Fox News.""Her allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless and we will continue to vigorously defend Fox against her unmeritorious legal claims which are riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees,"" according to the statement from a Fox News spokesperson.Though Fox settled the suit with Dominion earlier this month, paying it $787.5 million to avert a trial, there's more still to come.Another voting tech company, Smartmatic, which is headquartered in London, has also sued Fox News for defamation over election fraud lies. It is seeking $2.7 billion in damages.Lawyers for Smartmatic have requested to subpoena Grossberg in that case.

At 2:59 p.m. local time on Wednesday, a driver for Warren Consolidated Schools called the transportation base to let them know that she was feeling dizzy and needed to pull the bus over. As she slowed the bus down in preparation to stop, she lost consciousness, and the bus was still moving. Then, Dillon Reeves, sitting about five rows back, sprung into action. He threw his backpack down, ran to the front of the bus, grabbed the steering wheel and slowly applied the brakes before the bus could veer into oncoming traffic. Once the bus was stopped, Dillon yelled to his classmates, ""Someone call 911. Now!"" ""In my 35-plus years of education, this was an extraordinary act of courage and maturity on his part,"" Warren Consolidated Schools Superintendent Robert Livernois said at a news conference Thursday. The driver is currently in the hospital undergoing testing and monitoring, and must be screened for drugs, Livernois said. The driver, who was hired last July, had no previous history of fainting and had passed a required medical exam, Livernois said. There was light traffic on the road at the time of the incident and the bus was not damaged, Livernois said. A man walking down the street and a woman two cars behind the bus came to help after the incident. The man checked on the driver, while the woman led the children off the bus through the rear so they would not interfere with responders, Livernois said. Steve Reeves, Dillon's father, said his son has often rode on his lap while he drives and has driven golf carts in the past. Ireta Reeves, Dillon's mom, said, ""Dillon, he's really been a great guy this year. He's come a long way.

It makes my heart skip a beat to even watch that video."" Steve and Ireta Reeves, who are a health and safety supervisor and community nurse, respectively, said Dillon wants to be a police officer or a professional hockey player.

Judge Patti B. Saris will now decide whether to block the city’s most recently revised map from defining political districts over the next decade.Saris said earlier this week that she intends to review about 20 hours of recordings from the city’s redistricting hearings before issuing a ruling. Those familiar with the legal arguments of the case suggested her decision may come down to her interpretation of how heavily councilors weighed race in those proceedings — and specifically whether they used race appropriately in the redistricting process, as defense attorneys argued, or wrongfully prioritized it, as challengers insisted.Attorneys for those against the new map argued the plan, approved by both the Boston City Council on a 9-4 vote and Mayor Michelle Wu, was the result of racial gerrymandering that placed “racial balancing” above other map-drawing factors in violation of the 14th Amendment. Wednesday’s closing arguments followed five days of testimony, mostly from white politicians with deep personal ties to South Boston and Dorchester who were not pleased with the new map. The two neighborhoods are where the bulk of boundary shifts occurred in the most recent redistricting cycle due to a population swell in South Boston’s Seaport and a population shortage in one of two districts that cover Dorchester.Paul Gannon, one of the three attorneys challenging the map, characterized the redistricting process as “a charade” disguising a nefarious plan to gut the “heart and soul” of the city’s Dorchester-based third district in Neponset and Cedar Grove. The result, he argued, ultimately targeted white super-voters who consistently turn out for elections at higher-than-average proportions. By unnecessarily shifting them from one voting district into a neighboring district, the council diluted voting power in a long-held Black majority district and violated the Voting Rights Act, Gannon and his team argued.On the other side, attorneys defending the map said the shifted super-voting white precincts prioritized the area’s neighborhood cohesion. They pointed to a City Council committee report, which outlines concerns about community cohesion in Roslindale, Dorchester’s Fields Corner section and South Boston’s Villa Victoria and Cathedral housing projects that informed the ultimately approved map. That committee report seemed key to Saris’ understanding of the case Wednesday. Before defending attorneys pointed to it, she noted repeatedly that her ability to understand the council’s rationale for the redistricting plan was “impaired.” “All I have is a series of racial comments,” she said, noting that no councilors testified in defense of the map.But Saris also spent a portion of closing arguments quizzing attorneys for both sides on what might be an acceptable remedy if she were to find fault with Boston’s map-making process.Gannon said the city should revert back to its old map, an assertion Saris immediately dismissed since the old map contains unconstitutional population imbalances. Gannon then recommended a special master to redraw the city’s voting boundaries, an action taken in New York state last year after the state’s highest court threw out the newly redrawn districts. The map at issue represents the first such plan that emerged from a Boston City Council dominated by councilors of color, a shift that occurred in 2020. It’s a fact that Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who helped move the ultimately enacted map, said is curious outside the courthouse Wednesday. “I think it’s always interesting when there’s an allegation that there is some kind of offense being propagated against Black or Latino residents in the City of Boston, but you haven’t seen any Black or Latino elected officials” testifying against the city’s redistricting process, he said Wednesday, calling the suit a “bad faith effort” to overturn the map.Opponents also argued the City Council pushed to pass the map without giving adequate public notice for all of the gatherings in which the matter was discussed.U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, former Boston City Clerk and Councilor Maureen Feeney and sitting Councilors Michael Flaherty and Erin Murphy all testified over the course of the hearing. Flaherty and Lynch repeatedly alleged that the map diminishes the ability of public housing residents in South Boston to achieve effective political representation. During the days of testimony, attorneys for the city defended the map-making process with a single witness: Moon Duchin, a professor and redistricting lab director at Tufts University. She said her analysis showed the new map amounted to a “status quo” plan that retained a high degree of similarity with the old map and that it allowed voters of color to elect candidates of their choice.The expert also testified the new map lacked “significant change” to demographics and split precincts, two hallmark indicators of racial gerrymandering.During cross examination, Duchin avoided answering questions about connections between the ultimately enacted map and the City Council’s intent, but conceded that the city’s voting map could have been redrawn with fewer moves than the council ultimately agreed to.Judge Saris said repeatedly Wednesday that she needed to review the City Council redistricting recordings before delivering a decision that could interrupt the city’s municipal voting schedule and the slate of candidates seeking to represent the city for the year.“Don’t expect an opinion right away,” she told the court after arguments concluded.",Politics,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 18:24:24 EST",1d33527314a8cf272f68ab8a0220e27b

That's when a group of white nationalists carrying torches marched through the campus of the University of Virginia, some chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""Commonwealth's Attorney James Hingeley did not say in the release how many people have been indicted and did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment on Tuesday. According to electronic court records, the indictments against three people have been unsealed, including William Zachary Smith, of Nacona, Texas; Tyler Bradley Dykes, of Bluffton, South Carolina; and Dallas Medina, of Ravenna, Ohio.Each is charged with a single count of burning an object with the intent of intimidating a person or group of people. The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison.Smith's attorney, Cody Villalon, declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday. Dykes and Medina do not have the name of any attorneys listed in electronic court records.The indictments, which were issued in February but only recently unsealed, come almost six years after violence broke out during two days of demonstrations by the largest gathering of white nationalists in a decade.Clashes began on the night of Aug. 11, 2017, during the torch march, and continued the following day, when a ""Unite the Right"" rally was planned. James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes.Prosecutors said the indictments were issued ""as part of a criminal investigation that is active and ongoing,"" adding they work with law enforcement to investigate, analyze applicable laws, and bring charges ""when appropriate.""""This is our process regardless of how much time has passed or where the alleged offenders may be found,"" they said.Former President Donald Trump set off a firestorm of criticism when he said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the clashes between white nationalists and anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville.

This year, elected and public safety officials have tried to make sure that does not happen again. Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, who represents South Boston, joined GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about how the city is preparing for the parade. This transcript has been lightly edited. Ed Flynn: We have absolutely zero tolerance for hate groups trying to intimidate anybody. We want a parade that's safe and welcoming to all. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our diversity. But for hate organizations to come into Boston, we have zero tolerance for them, and there's no place at all for them in this city. Paris Alston: The white supremacist group in NSC-131 made an appearance and had that banner at last year's parade. What would exactly stop someone from doing that exact same thing again? I mean, anyone could show up and display a banner. So how do you make sure that that doesn't happen? And what's going to happen if it does? Flynn: Well, I think that's the critical question you are asking. And we all support the First Amendment. But when people come in to a parade, into a public gathering, with a message of hate, a message of division and violence, that is despicable, and that's dividing people, and that is causing harm. And that's not about the First Amendment. That's about intimidating people of color, immigrant neighbors, the LGBTQ community. So certainly it's a balancing act, but as far as I'm concerned, the First Amendment doesn't apply when you are trying to intimidate people, you are trying to discriminate against people. We have seen a rise in hate crimes here in Boston, the most progressive city in the country. We have seen hate groups march through downtown Boston and through the Chinatown area, a large AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community. We also have a large LGBT community in downtown Boston. We have seen hate groups cause disruption and chaos at various hospitals, including Children's Hospital, that are assisting LGBTQ patients. We also have seen hate groups intimidating medical professionals of color at one of the prominent Boston hospitals. So it's important that we work together — not just the police, not just civil rights groups, but everyday residents of Boston. And when we see some type of demonstration beginning, or any type of intimidation, we need to call police. Let the police know about it. We also have to strengthen our civil rights units. We need to document these incidents, investigate them and educate the public. Alston: Council president, I also have to acknowledge that there has been evidence of at least some sort of divisions that are happening within the City Council throughout the past year. And of course, that has included a verbal attack that Councilor Frank Baker made on Councilor Liz Breadon, who emigrated from Northern Ireland. Now, I know we're talking about two very different things, right? But I know that people have made links between those things, and we know that what happens with our leadership in this city can sometimes be a reflection of what's going on between everyday citizens. And so what have the conversations been like among the council when we talk about how we are respecting, when we're in conversation and in discourse with one another? Flynn: Well, I think, Paris, that there has to be more civility in government, in politics. I see it on both sides that people — even good people of good will — are doing and saying things that they normally would not say. But it's about recognizing our differences, respecting each other, knowing that we're not always going to agree with each other, but we have to respect each other. And if we don't respect each other in government, residents across the city, or residents across the state, will see it. When elected officials are not acting appropriately and being disrespectful, it almost is an invitation for our citizens to act that way again. So we have to get back to the basics of treating people with respect and dignity. And that starts with us right here. Alston: So lastly, council president, we've talked about a lot of heavy stuff here, but we also have to remember that the Southie parade is meant to be a joyous occasion, right? So what are you looking forward to about this year's parade? Flynn: What I like most about the parade is we celebrate not just the contributions and sacrifices of the Irish, but also the veterans' community and our military families. I had the opportunity to serve 25 years in the United States Navy. Alston: Thank you for your service. Flynn: Yes, thank you. And in my neighborhood in South Boston, we have the highest number of men that were killed in Vietnam. It's a happy time for the parade, but it's also a time when we acknowledge the incredible sacrifices made by our military families, including our Gold Star families as well. I know they'll be at the parade and it's an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and to thank them for their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.",Local,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 10:09:42 EST",1d5ba9e1d2f5a736071d09bd7b8ce254

As in the ticking sound an analog watch makes while the seconds and minutes pass. Or as shorthand for ""hurry up."" Like when my college dean was unmoved by my — I thought — heartfelt pleas for a pass/fail grade for one of my classes. Dean Maude Chaplin said no to my theatrics and then added for emphasis, “Tick tock. You need to get to the library.” I did, in case you were wondering. In the various broadcast newsrooms where I have worked, tick tock was shorthand for the timeline of an event. Somebody was always yelling ‘’Where’s the tick tock on the hearings?”The old-fashioned analog clock may be ticking down for the digital phenomenon TikTok, a short video hosting service owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. It’s taken the world by storm, a favorite app for about 20% of the world’s internet users. At 1 billion — with a “b” — active users spread across 154 countries, TikTok’s siren song of dance challenges, how-to demonstrations, cooking tutorials, and more is an ever-changing landscape. Some months ago, I explained how the platform’s proprietary design precisely customizes content based on each user’s prior viewing habits. Americans love their TikTok, but a recent Quinnipiac University Poll revealed 49% favored a ban. Quinnipiac’s polling analyst Dr. Tim Malloy concluded most Americans “would like to click delete and send TikTok to the dustbin of social media history.” Perhaps, but as the results showed, the largest group of TikTok users — the 18- to 34-year-olds — don't want the ban.But the drumbeat for shutting down the app gained momentum after the White House issued an order to all federal agencies to delete it from government devices. Canada followed suit with its own TikTok ban, as did New Zealand and Britain. And now the Biden administration has upped the ante threatening an outright ban of TikTok if the Chinese-owned company isn’t sold. Last week TikTok’s top executive Shou Zi Chew endured a bipartisan verbal pummeling from an openly skeptical, sometimes hostile, congressional committee warning of the danger of the app’s influence on young people and its ability to collect Americans’ personal information. During his five hours of testimony, Chew insisted TikTok operated independently from the Chinese government. He emphasized the plan for a Texas-based firewall to protect American data. Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig bluntly told Chew, “Project Texas just doesn’t pass the smell test.”I’m fascinated by the too-late handwringing about TikTok — at this point equivalent to closing the barn door after the horses have escaped. Unless there is some solid evidence that TikTok is indeed a political and military threat, all of this Sturm und Drang has no actual point. And I’ll note that Shou Chew recently revealed he doesn’t allow his children to use the app. He points out that TikTok does not allow kids younger than 13 to use TikTok, except in America. I’d be surprised if his children hadn’t already figured out a way around that because few can resist the pull of TikTok’s can’t-stop-scrolling content. I expect it will take more than a ban to erase TikTok.This article was updated to correct a typo.",Commentary,"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 05:00:01 EST",7567eb8ee505b937334ea29a0ede5fa7
1076,Top stories GBH News is following this week,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/28/top-stories-gbh-news-is-following-this-week,Gov. Healey is filing her first budget and a local sheriff's office is lowering its minimum hiring age.,"Every week, GBH News assignment editor Matt Baskin joins GBH’s All Things Considered to look at stories the newsroom is following. This week, tune in for updates on Gov. Maura Healey's soon-to-be-released budget, a local sheriff's plan to hire 19-year-olds as correctional officers and the state of Salem's mayoral race. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Baskin and host Arun Rath. Arun Rath: So tomorrow is the first day of March and Gov. Healey is expected to release her proposal for the state’s budget. We had some teasers last week, but do we have any sense of what else we might be looking for? Matt Baskin: A bunch of things, both within the budget plan itself and in the process surrounding it. I was talking about this with our State House reporter Katie Lannan earlier. We’re expecting Healey to devote some attention to, no surprise, the T. I won’t list all the disasters the T has dealt with this past year — there was one just this morning that caused power to go out across the whole system — but one big overarching issue that’s been the source of a lot of other problems is lack of staffing. Healey has said she wants to put money towards hiring 1,000 new workers for the T. Solving the staffing problem could be a real step in the right direction, but if Healey does indeed put a big chunk of money into hiring, there’s still the issue of actually attracting workers. The T has been running its own major hiring campaign the past several months, but the staffing shortage still persists. So we’ll see if more money can help solve it.Something else to look for is whether Healey keeps her pledge to put 1% of her budget to environmental agencies. And we’ll also find out if Healey holds true to the promise she made in her inaugural address to make community college free for folks 25 and older who don’t yet have a degree. Beyond just the numbers, the line items, we’ll see if there’s significant policy written into this spending plan. That would be a way for Healey to say, “This is a priority for me.”And then outside the budget itself and looking at the process, this is going to be an opportunity to really see how the new governor works with the Legislature. This is Healey’s first budget season. In the weeks ahead, the state Senate and the Massachusetts House will be coming out with their own proposed budgets, and leaders from both of those chambers and the governor will have to hammer out some sort of compromise. It’s yet to be seen whether that’ll be easy or hard, acrimonious or drama-free, but it’ll help set the tone for what Healey’s relationship with the Legislature is gonna be like for the next four years and how our state government is going to function.Rath: You mentioned staffing shortages with the T. Staffing shortages are also apparently behind the Essex County sheriff’s plan to drop the minimum hiring age for corrections officers — that’s jail guards — from 21 to 19. We heard a little bit about that yesterday, but we’re doing some follow-up reporting on that, right?Baskin: Yeah, you know, it's in process. Diego Lopez, senior producer for GBH's All Things Considered, spoke with Essex County sheriff Kevin Coppinger about this yesterday. Coppinger says that his office — like you mentioned, like the T, like so many businesses — is dealing with staffing issues, and lowering the hiring age is meant to deal with that. And he made the point that this isn’t necessarily unprecedented. He says his office has hired 19-year-olds in decades past, and that other county sheriffs in Massachusetts and across the country have too. I think the idea of 19-year-olds working a job like this doesn’t sit well with some people. These are still technically teenagers. A two-year difference might feel arbitrary to some, but corrections officers do a difficult job and they wield a lot of power over other people’s lives. So right now we’re checking in with other county sheriffs’ offices around the commonwealth — as well as the Massachusetts Department of Correction, which handles state-level prisons — to see what their minimum hiring age is. And we’re trying to speak with other professionals in law enforcement and with advocacy groups to get their take on whether this is a reasonable way to deal with staffing problems.Rath: Before you go, we’re still feeling some of the effects of the new government that's in place now. With Maura Healey taking office last month, we’ve recently had state Rep. Jon Santiago leave his seat in the House to serve in Healey’s cabinet. And, of course, Kim Driscoll left a void in Salem when she resigned as that city’s mayor to become lieutenant governor. What’s the state of things in Salem now? Baskin: I know we’re short on time, so real quick: there are five candidates in the running. I won’t name all of them, but the field includes the Salem city councilor who’s right now serving as acting mayor. There’s also Kim Driscoll’s chief of staff from when she ran the city. And there’s a former mayor of Salem who preceded Driscoll in office, back in the ’90s, and three decades later is coming back for more. The candidates are taking part in a mayoral forum this evening, which we’ll be covering, and Salem voters will narrow the field of five down to two in a preliminary election that’s scheduled for March 28, a month from today. And then there'll be a final election that’s scheduled for May 16. Rath: I guess we just can't get enough elctions. Matt, thank you.Baskin: Thank you Arun.",Local,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:02:44 EST",7f1bb8b612d37b3194c2d81963a2b29a
4587,How a new MLB rule could change baseball games this season,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/02/27/how-a-new-mlb-rule-could-change-baseball-games-this-season,"There are a few key rule changes coming to Major League Baseball this season, but one in particular already is throwing players for a curve.","There are a few key rule changes coming to Major League Baseball this season, but one in particular already is throwing players for a curve.Spring training games underway in Florida and Arizona have featured a new pitch clock, which gives pitchers a set amount of time before they have to throw the ball.The timer is set to 15 seconds if the bases are empty or 20 seconds if there are runners on base, and the hitter has to be in the batter's box with eight seconds left on the clock.MLB officials say the pitch clock can help reduce the length of games, which have averaged more than three hours long in recent years. But the new rule has drawn some criticism, and over the weekend it caused bewilderment on the diamond.On Saturday, during a spring training matchup between the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox, Braves hitter Cal Conley was called out for failing to get into the batter's box on time. The game — which was in the bottom of the ninth inning with a full count, two outs and the bases loaded — ended in a tie. Conley reacted with shocked laughter.The pitch clock isn't the only new rule popping up this season.First, second and third bases have grown in size from 15 inches square to 18 inches square, which the MLB says will reduce player injuries. The league is also requiring two infielders on each side of the second-base line before a pitch is thrown, preventing them from crowding one side or another in a defensive maneuver known as the ""infield shift.""League officials say the rule changes didn't come out of left field but rather were developed in response to feedback from players and umpires, and were first tested in the minor leagues.""These steps are designed to improve pace of play, increase action, and reduce injuries, all of which are goals that have overwhelming support among our fans,"" MLB commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. said in a statement in September, when the new rules were approved.""Throughout the extensive testing of recent years, Minor League personnel and a wide range of fans – from the most loyal to casual observers – have recognized the collective impact of these changes in making the game even better and more enjoyable,"" Manfred added.For example, last year in the minor leagues the pitch clock helped reduce the average length of a game by 25 minutes, and the larger bases led to a 13% reduction in ""injury events"" near the bases, the MLB said.That teams will be able to get used to the new rules — particularly the pitch clock — during spring training. And despite the pushback, some pitchers have suggested the new timer may actually give them an advantage.""I can work extremely quickly, or I can work extremely slow,"" New York Mets star pitcher Max Scherzer told reporters after his first spring training start. ""There is another layer here to be able to mess with the hitter's timing."" [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 12:29:00 EST",21e014bc9402a7dbf59497e1c30d6089
1546,Here's what a Worcester man went through to avoid homelessness,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/02/27/heres-what-a-worcester-man-went-through-to-avoid-homelessness,Dave Vespucci has fantasized about one thing for the past year: to relax in his reclining chair in a home he doesn’t have to worry about leaving.,"Dave Vespucci has fantasized about one thing for the past year: to relax in his reclining chair in a home he doesn’t have to worry about leaving. For more than two decades, Vespucci, 75, was able to do that in a sky blue duplex in a quiet residential neighborhood in Worcester. He was a good tenant, who always paid his rent on time and helped maintain the property. But around late 2021, with housing values and rents across Worcester surging, his landlord decided he would renovate and sell the duplex for a profit. Vespucci had to move out. Vespucci, who’s diabetic and has a bad back after working decades in the construction industry, then spent over a year looking for a new apartment he could afford. He had a February 2023 deadline to leave the duplex, and feared homelessness as he struggled to find apartments within his budget — about $1,300 a month, split with his daughter. Finally in January, just three weeks before the deadline, Vespucci found a unit in a three-decker. Although about 90 other people applied for the apartment, the landlord sympathized with him and agreed to lease it to him. “I’m thankful for sure. It was a godsend,” he said. “You don’t hear of these kinds of things.” GBH News has followed Vespucci for the past year as part of the series “Priced Out: The fight for housing in Massachusetts.” His journey exemplifies a worsening problem in New England’s second largest city, which used to be affordable for local workers but now is a hotbed for rising housing costs. Typical monthly rents in Worcester are up more than $600 since 2016, according to Zillow, and about half of all renters are cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on rent and utilities. Housing advocates say the problem stems from Worcester’s dearth of apartments affordable for low- to moderate-income households. Although thousands of new rental units have hit the city’s housing market in recent years, they’re too expensive for many people who work in Worcester. Instead, they tailor to higher-earning people with jobs based in Boston and MetroWest. Despite its hot market, Worcester’s monthly median rent of $1,850 is significantly less than that of Boston — $3,250. As a result, Worcester is an attractive place to reside for people who work in the Boston area but don’t want to pay to live there. Worcester is just over an hourlong trip from Boston on the commuter rail. “It’s very excruciating,” said Yvette Dyson, executive director of Worcester Common Ground — a nonprofit that builds affordable housing. “We see the tradeoff of people coming to Worcester.” Worcester officials acknowledge the city’s affordable housing shortage is pricing out local workers and have taken steps like creating a trust fund to address the problem. Another policy that would mandate that all new housing complexes include a certain percentage of units affordable for lower-income households, known as inclusionary zoning, is mired in debate.Around the time GBH first profiled Vespucci in June 2022, his landlord had just agreed to give him an extension until February 2023 to move out. Vespucci was relieved but knew what he was up against.He had already spent six months scouring through online apartment listings trying to find something he could afford. The stress of the ordeal caused him to lose 20 pounds, which destabilized his diabetes and brought on dizziness, sweating and fatigue. “All this is too much for people who are in my position,” Vespucci said in May. “It’s not right.” Over the next four months, Vespucci continued looking for apartments but his luck with the housing search and his personal life only worsened. First, he caught pneumonia, then his brother died. In October, he secured an apartment in Southbridge, a half-hour’s drive from Worcester. His lease would start in February after some renovation work on the unit. Although he preferred to stay closer to Worcester — where his doctors are — he concluded the apartment was his only option. But in January as he began boxing up his belongings and preparing to move to Southbridge, he learned the renovation work was delayed and the lease fell through. His deadline to move out was now three weeks away, and he started panicking.“I can’t live on the street,” he said at the time. “I’m just frazzled. I haven’t slept.” At that point, Vespucci and his daughter went into “desperation mode,” frantically calling services that help seniors with housing. His son, Nick, who lives in Maryland, joined the effort, cold-calling landlords with online apartment listings and telling them Vespucci’s story. But all of the listings either were scams or had long waitlists.“I was losing sleep over it,” Nick said, “just kind of thinking, ‘What are we going to do if the day comes,’” and the sheriff evicts him and he has nowhere to go. Finally, Nick reached Pam Kirk, a landlord with an open apartment in a Worcester triple-decker. Although about 90 other people had already applied for the unit, Kirk decided to give it to Vespucci after hearing about what he’d been through. “I felt bad,” Kirk said. “I could put myself in [his] position and think, ‘Wow, what would I do?’”Kirk is charging Vespucci and his daughter $1,300 a month in rent. The unit features polished wood floors, new appliances, a balcony with views of much of Worcester and a swimming pool in the backyard. The triple-decker is Kirk's only rental property, and she and her husband live on the first floor. Although she knows she can charge more for Vespucci's apartment, she wants to provide housing that’s affordable for people. She also prefers to have the same tenants living in her two rental units for multiple years so she can avoid the process of having to find new tenants. Vespucci is thankful for that mentality. “[She] saved me from the street,” he said. Today, he can finally sit in his navy blue recliner, knowing he has a home he doesn’t have to leave anytime soon. Still, he’s in disbelief he came so close to homelessness.“This is the commonwealth of Massachusetts. Commonwealth. And it should be a priority [to have housing] for women with kids, old people, the infirmed,” he said. “It shouldn’t be like this.

Among the congregants were Charles Bulfinch, the architect of the Massachusetts State House and the U.S. Capitol Building, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., a doctor and renowned poet. In the 1780s, the congregation became the first Unitarian church in the nation.But the church was also home to enslavers and the people they claimed as property. King’s Chapel’s own history project has concluded that at least 71 enslavers were members and ministers in the chapel and two thirds of the money raised in 1747 to build the stone chapel came from people tied to the slave trade.“This beautiful building, and ways in which we worship every Sunday that is so meaningful to us, would not be here but for the slave trade,” said Joy Fallon, the chapel’s minister.The building is stuffed with plaques and memorials to church members across the centuries, but Fallon said “as we've told the history of our congregation, which we are very proud of, we didn't know the whole story.” Beginning a half dozen years ago, the church began to excavate the history of its ties to slavery, and began posting signs around the sanctuary to call attention to those who had been connected to the slave trade.Now, Fallon said, the congregation's ""hope is to tell the full story.”King’s Chapel has hired MASS Design Group — the same design team behind the Embrace sculpture on Boston Common — to oversee design and installation of a slavery memorial that basically encircles the chapel. Outside the chapel will be a statue of an enslaved woman opening cages to release birds to freedom; all around the chapel and its grounds will be 219 birds representing the 219 enslaved people who have been identified as being connected to the congregation; and the ceiling inside will be painted with a vast mural of birds being released into an open sky.David Waters, a King's Chapel Memorial Committee Member, says coming to grips with the ugly parts of the church's past is a journey of learning and faith — which the memorial is designed to encourage. “There's a reason why the memorial is in three parts,” he said. “It begins with this statue outside in the courtyard. Then your attention shifts to these birds that are located at various different places in the exterior. And then you come inside and you find this extraordinary mural. That itself is a journey.”The memorial project also includes a “living memorial” — a fund that the congregation will use to partner with local organizations “to do the work of repair and reconciliation in the community.” Waters said this might include working with local groups to stem violence in Black and brown communities or support people who are unhoused. It could also include educational programs and possibly scholarships, he said.Jha D Amazi, a principal at MASS Design Group who is overseeing the physical memorial project, said this kind of reinterpretation of historic monuments is critical to repairing the harm done to people of color since they were largely erased from centuries of the nation’s history. “We know that our current representation of history is very one-sided. It is painfully one-sided, oppressively one-sided,” she said, adding that memorials often exclude “anyone other than white men.”Amazi said the critical question confronting the stewards of these historic places is, “How do we create the space to say that we were all actually there and we were all actually affected by and impacted by these moments in history — and we played a role?”And for Amazi, the quest is increasingly personal. She is the parent of a one-year-old child, and said when her son was born it ""completely changed the game.""“Talk about a fire lit underneath me. I was like, ‘Oh no, y'all, this world is going to show him that he belongs, that he is honored, that his experience matters, that his voice will be heard.’ Every space I can touch, I am going to touch and paint for my son.”Harmonia Rosales, an Afro-Cuban artist who was selected to create the memorial, tells a similar story. In a video of the proposed memorial produced by MASS Design Group, Rosales says she was a classically trained painter who loved museums — until her five-year-old daughter pointed out that she was not depicted in those paintings. Along Boston’s Freedom trail — a red brick path that winds through the city connecting 17 historic sites that played key roles in the American Revolution — the story of slavery is rarely told. But several sites along the trail are now grappling with how to reflect that history.Waters says he hopes the King's Chapel memorial can model for other sites the value of declaring that the modern congregation stands ""in solidarity with those who are marginalized and oppressed."" And also that today's worshippers seek and share the truth about racism in the past and also in the present . And for the congregation that has worshiped in the building for centuries, this transformation is a matter of faith, Fallon said. “If you're going to love truth, there is no choice for a church, especially to tell the truth,” she said. “And Jesus said, 'The truth will make you free.' And it's so true. So that's what we're trying to do.”Boston University journalism students Cassandra Dumay and Jessie Sage O'Leary contributed to this report",Local,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 05:00:01 EST",d2f7c532f578a102e88a3eca090a43d1
5442,Why the Massachusetts Legislature is off to an exceptionally slow start,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/06/02/the-massachusetts-legislature-is-off-to-an-exceptionally-slow-start,A lack of competition could be one reason.,"Recently, former President Barack Obama wrote a Twitter thread praising the political situation in Minnesota, where the 2022 elections left Democrats in control of the House, the Senate, and the governorship. They responded with an incredibly aggressive lawmaking push: among other things, they restored voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, made school lunches free for all students, and made tuition at public colleges free for families that make less than eighty thousand dollars. Whether that’s cause for celebration depends on your politics. But whatever your point of view, one thing is clear: here in Massachusetts, where the 2022 elections also left Democrats in complete control, there’s no comparable sense of urgency on Beacon Hill. In fact, according to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Legislature is off to its slowest start in at least four decades, with just twelve bills total passed into law so far this year. Why is the Legislature moving so slowly? And what isn’t getting addressed as a result?

Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis to return to their posts in the Tennessee state legislature, at least temporarily.","Impending local meetings could pave the way for former Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis to return to their posts in the Tennessee state legislature, at least temporarily.The two former Democratic lawmakers, who were expelled by Republican colleagues after they staged a protest on the House floor calling for gun law reforms, say they want their seats back. Jones and Pearson, both of whom are Black, were voted out of the Tennessee House on Thursday for their actions that took place in response to the deadly school shooting in Nashville. Some 130,000 voters in heavily Black districts are currently without representation in the House. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, who is white and also led the protest, survived expulsion by one vote. Jones and Pearson voiced their desire to return to their seats as lawmakers in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. ""We will continue to fight for our constituents,"" Jones said.""This attack against us is hurting all people in our state,"" he added. ""Even though it is disproportionately impacting Black and brown communities, this is hurting poor white people ... silencing them.""Pearson told NPR's All Things Considered on Saturday that he hoped to return to the legislature. He said he and Jones were stripped of their positions because they ""decided that it was time for the state of Tennessee Republicans to stop listening to the NRA and start listening to the thousands of children and teens and grandmothers and siblings who are mourning because of the effects of gun violence."" Republicans said the expelled lawmakers disrupted order and broke procedural rules in the chamber.Local officials' meetings this week could appoint both as interim replacements for the empty seatsThe vacancies of both expelled lawmakers may be short-lived. Nashville Vice Mayor Jim Shulman has called for a special Metropolitan Council meeting on Monday to discuss filling the empty District 52 House seat left by Jones, according to an email tweeted out by councilmember Bob Mendes.If the council chooses to do so, it could vote to appoint an interim successor as soon as Monday night, Shulman told Axios. The majority of Nashville's 40-member council have already vowed to reappoint Jones, according to NBC News — with some signaling their intention to do so before the council meeting was even called.After the council appoints an interim House representative nominee, the county will hold a special election — in which Jones is eligible to run — to carry out the term.Meanwhile, the board of commissioners for Shelby County, which includes Memphis, plans to consider reinstating Pearson.Chairman Mickell Lowery announced he was calling a special meeting on Wednesday afternoon to ""consider the action to reappoint Mr. Justin Pearson to his duly elected position to represent the citizens in District 86,"" local station Action News 5 reported.Chances appear to favor Pearson's return: Commissioner Erika Sugarmon told the Memphis Commercial Appeal that the former lawmaker has enough supporters sitting in the commission, which has a Democratic supermajority, to get him successfully reappointed. The county will then hold a special election to fill the seat. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 05:00:00 EST",0abb161b49286ec0162c51fc5e50fc68

7541,The woman who introduced MLK Jr. and Coretta Scott lies in an unmarked grave in Boston,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/01/the-woman-who-introduced-mlk-jr-and-coretta-scott-lies-in-an-unmarked-grave-in-boston,"Mary Powell, whose matchmaking sparked an iconic civil rights union, is buried in West Roxbury.","Under iron gray skies, amateur genealogist Wendy Gelberg trudged through fresh snow and a corridor of tombstones dotting the landscape of the St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury. In the cemetery’s St. James of the Apostle section, she paused to check her map, which was scribbled with notes. Gelberg, who specializes in identifying unmarked graves, was there to identify the resting place of Mary Powell, who as a young woman introduced Martin Luther King Jr. to his future bride, Coretta Scott, in Boston.“So she's in this row right here,” Gelberg said. “That's where she is. She's between — I think that says — 'Withen’ and ‘Vanderwood.’ And that is her location right in front of us.”In Boston, you can hardly throw a stone and not hit a monument or grave marker identifying where a person of note is buried. But standing at the grave of the woman who brought together this iconic civil rights couple, there’s nothing whatsoever to indicate her significance in the world — or even her presence in it. “I just think it's sad. Somebody lived a life that deserves to be recognized. And even for people who don't know the person who's passed. It's very heartwarming, actually, to see the tributes,” Gelberg said, pointing to a sea of polished gravestones and inscribed words of remembrance for loved ones spread across the breadth of the cemetery. But there was nothing but snow-covered ground and a plot number in Gelberg's notebook to mark where Powell was buried. There was no name.""There's no name because there's no headstone,"" said Gelberg. The Embrace, the new sculpture on Boston Common, was inspired by the story of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott coming together in this city. But in all of the celebration surrounding the sculpture's unveiling in January, little was said about the woman who introduced them to each other.Powell, a former Boston school teacher and and local opera singer, passed away from leukemia on Sept. 11, 1991, at the age of 76. An obituary published in the Boston Globe confirms that Mary Louise Powell founded ""World Day"" in Roxbury to assist children and the homeless. Powell, who graduated from Spellman College and the New England Conservatory of Music, had taught biology in Boston Public Schools for nearly 20 years, including several at English High. As a young woman, she'd been friends with both King and Scott. King was a student at Boston University. Scott and Powell were sopranos studying at conservatory. Powell also knew MLK from her association with 12th Street Baptist Church and the Urban League.There are tens of thousands of unmarked and unengraved gravesites of Black and Indigenous people spread across the United States, according to the African American Intellectual History Society. Identifying those graves has garnered more attention and scholarship in recent years.Gelberg came to know about Powell through a genealogy website that researches death records called findagrave.com, an internet site used by people all over the world to find burial sites. The platform relies on a community of volunteers to help pinpoint often difficult to find graves. In December, a stranger reached out for help to find the resting place of a former school teacher and opera singer in Boston who had changed her name to Mary Louise Gordon.“I happened to see a request one day that happened to have a deadline associated with it. And it was, I think, two days before Christmas, and he had a 24-hour deadline,” said Gelberg. The request came from Clennon King, a Georgia-born documentarian, historian and former Boston reporter, who for decades has researched Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott’s relationship. Clennon King lives in Georgia, returning there from Boston several years ago. Weeks before The Embrace sculpture was unveiled on the Common, 14 miles away, Gelberg picked up the telephone to inform King that MLK and Scott’s college friend has rested in near total obscurity since her burial. Clennon King said he found it sadly ironic. “Here is all of this hullabaloo around this courtship,” he said, “and the person who was really responsible for connecting them lies in an unmarked grave over in West Roxbury.” Clennon King, no relationship to MLK, had a second purpose in seeking to find out what became of Mary Powell. ""What I was trying to do is to get a hold of her son,"" King said. ""Her son, believe it or not, lives in Boston. She had one child, and he lives in Jamaica Plain."" Michael Powell, a tall, bearded man, looks younger than his 76 years suggest. Now retired, he's a former social worker who started a construction business later in life. He also describes himself as a proud father of five children. Over coffee in Jamaica Plain, he spoke adoringly of his late mother.""I say for a little Black girl born in 1915 from Atlanta, she had a great head on her shoulders,"" Powell said, smiling. He recalled how at his mother's funeral, the Rev. Michael Haynes, then senior pastor at the 12th Baptist Church and longtime friend of Martin Luther King Jr., delivered the eulogy before a small gathering of loved ones. Michael Powell remembers the many recitals he attended with his mother, who aspired to be an opera singer like her idol, Marian Anderson. But overcoming the racial barriers in classical music was extremely difficult. She was she not able to perform as widely as she dreamed. Michael said sometimes when the wind is calm, he can almost hear his mother's melodious soprano in the air. ""She sang in the Gardner Museum, the 12th Baptist Church, the First Church in Roxbury. She was a singer, and I'm like 7 or 8 years old just tagging along,"" he said. Almost apologetically, Powell explains that the reason for his mother's unmarked grave is far more complicated than might be assumed, and that it has to do with his own mortality. “I purchased two graves there. I was going to make one stone for two graves when I passed away. So I just never deemed it to be something that I needed to do sooner than later,” he said. For years, the memory of his mother was the only inscription he needed. But in recent months, Powell says he’s come to realize that his mother’s story deserves to be shared with others. On many occasions, Powell heard his mother detail her role in introducing the Kings. “Coretta and my mother were on their way someplace,” her said. “And Martin came by, and my mother introduces Coretta to him. You know, they chat for a little while and then they part. And then later that afternoon, my mother says he called her on the telephone, and he wanted to know who that lady — who Coretta — was. And that's how they met.” In 1953, Mary Powell drove with other friends through the Jim Crow South to Atlanta to celebrate the new couple, and then to Scott's hometown of Heiberger, Alabama, for the wedding. That fateful meeting arranged by Powell led to the love story that’s now honored on the Boston Common. Boston NAACP President Tanisha Sullivan suggests that the local community go even further by honoring Powell with a gravestone and prominent inscription. “As a community, we could work with the family to help get a marker in recognition of her serving as the spark that connected two of the world's most influential and impactful leaders,” said Sullivan. That's a gesture Michael Powell, Mary Powell's son, would welcome. ""It's a great idea. I just think that it's a wonderful thing that the community gets to recognize and honor her, as she should have been,"" he said.",National,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 17:10:34 EST",07addee38b4be9375066d8eebd682227
3371,A new nasal spray to reverse fentanyl and other opioid overdoses gets FDA approval,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/23/a-new-nasal-spray-to-reverse-fentanyl-and-other-opioid-overdoses-gets-fda-approval,WASHINGTON — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved a new easy-to-use version of a medication to reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids driving the nation's drug crisis.,"WASHINGTON — U.S. health regulators on Monday approved a new easy-to-use version of a medication to reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids driving the nation's drug crisis.Opvee is similar to naloxone, the life-saving drug that has been used for decades to quickly counter overdoses of heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers. Both work by blocking the effects of opioids in the brain, which can restore normal breathing and blood pressure in people who have recently overdosed.The Food and Drug Administration endorsed Opvee, a nasal spray update of the drug nalmefene, which was first approved as an injection in the mid-1990s but later removed from the market due to low sales. Naloxone comes as both a nasal spray and injection.It's not immediately clear how the new drug will be used differently compared to naloxone, and some experts see potential downsides to its longer-acting effect. The drug will be available via prescription and is approved for patients 12 and older.In studies funded by the federal government, Opvee achieved similar recovery results to Narcan, the leading brand of naloxone nasal spray.Opvee was developed by Opiant Pharmaceuticals, which was recently acquired by rival Indivior, maker of several medications for opioid addiction. Indivior expects to launch Opvee in October at the earliest.As the opioid epidemic has shifted to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, researchers in the pharmaceutical industry and the U.S. government saw a new role for the drug.Because fentanyl stays in the body longer than heroin and other opioids, some people may require multiple doses of naloxone over several hours to fully reverse an overdose.Scientists at the National Institutes of Health worked with pharmaceutical researchers on a nasal spray version of nalmefene that would quickly resuscitate users, while also protecting them from relapse. Testing and development was funded by more than $18 million in grants from the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the NIH, which also helped design the studies.""The whole aim of this was to have a medication that would last longer but also reach into the brain very rapidly,"" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Still, some experts see potential downsides.A side effect of all opioid reversal drugs is that they create intense withdrawal symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, muscle cramps and anxiety. With naloxone, those symptoms might last 30 to 40 minutes.Dr. Lewis Nelson of Rutgers University says those problems can last six hours or more with nalmefene, requiring extra treatment and management by health professionals.""The risk of long-lasting withdrawal is very real and we try to avoid it,"" said Nelson, an emergency medicine physician and former adviser to the FDA on opioids.Nelson said it's easy enough to give a second or third dose of naloxone if it wears off.""We're not suffering from a naloxone shortage where we need to use an alternative,"" he said. ""We have plenty of it and it works perfectly well.""The FDA approval comes as drug overdose deaths inched up slightly last year after two big leaps during the pandemic. More than 109,000 fatal overdoses were recorded in 2022, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.More than two-thirds of those deaths were linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which have largely replaced heroin and prescription opioids.Naloxone has long been at the center of government efforts to fight the overdose crisis at the federal and local levels. Police, firefighters and other first responders routinely carry the drug. And officials in all 50 states have given orders to pharmacists to sell or dispense the drug without a prescription to anyone who wants it.In the latest federal push, the FDA recently approved Narcan to be sold over the counter. The change will allow the new version of the drug to be stocked in grocery stores, vending machines and other retail locations. The nasal spray — which includes updated instructions for regular users — is expected to launch this summer. Emergent Biosolutions hasn't yet announced a price for the over-the-counter version.Indivior said it is still considering what to charge for its drug. It will compete in the same market as naloxone, where most buyers are local governments and community groups that distribute to first responders and those at risk of overdose. Indivior has told investors that Opvee could eventually generate annual sales between $150 million to $250 million.

7286,"For survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing, every day is an anniversary",https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/04/17/for-survivors-of-the-boston-marathon-bombing-every-day-is-an-anniversary,Callie Crossley reflects on Boston's ten years of grieving.,"Ten Marathon Mondays ago twin bombs blew up the streets and the hearts of Boston. Ten years since the happy cheers and applause curdled into gut-wrenching screams piercing the smoky haze of flying debris. Ten years since the explosions killed three people and more than a dozen lost limbs. The Boston Marathon bombing still stands as one of the nation’s deadliest domestic terror attacks. Now a decade later we mark the day when horror and history melded before and after. A milestone anniversary demands we pause to make meaning of the time between then and now. Back then we shared the initial days of shock, the fear of an escaped terrorist and tears that flowed freely. We drew comfort in communal gatherings, drew strength from our shared experience, and in our fierce public declaration of taking back our power: Boston Strong. Michele Blackburn, a survivor of the bombing, was injured while standing near the finish line. She lost most of her left calf and endured extensive long-term rehabilitation. She didn’t lose her leg but as she told the Boston Globe recently, she carried survivor’s guilt. Now, after ten years, she is running the race saying “That’s weight that I don’t want to carry around anymore.” At the Boylston Street finish line where Blackburn was injured, now there are four twisted spires of bronzed metal reaching skyward. They stand sentry in a moving memorial to those who lost their lives in an instant. A remembrance and a reminder of our pledge never to forget.But some can’t forget — emotionally and mentally, time stopped for them. Many don’t show any signs of physical injury but carry invisible scars: the trauma they still live with. Listening to their stories of being haunted by the memories in 2013 prompted Massachusetts Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to introduce the Post Disaster Mental Health Response Act which President Biden signed into law. It will extend federal aid to victims suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In announcing the proposed bill, Pressley urged support for these often-overlooked marathon bombing victims, saying the next pandemic will be widespread and untreated trauma. I’ve been looking back on my observations on the Marathon bombing anniversaries. On the first, I noted the ongoing grief that still felt fresh. On the third anniversary, I wondered if we had gone through the documented stages of grief — denial/anxiety/bargaining/anger/despair/hope — so that the Marathon had moved out of the shadow of the bombing. And now I wonder if time will ever dull the sharp edges of the anniversaries to come.Grief expert Elizabeth Kubler Ross says simply, “the reality is that you will grieve forever.” In her co-authored book, “On Grief and Grieving” she adds, “You will be whole again … but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same nor would you want to.” The next ten years start now.",Commentary,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 05:00:52 EST",56671458448e096674cc1db200af81b1

People experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder have received medical care and housing at the hotel since a sweep of a nearby homeless encampment in December 2021. A Boston Medical Center clinic at the formerly abandoned hotel will shut down by the end of March, according to a spokesperson for the medical center. The clinic currently provides area residents with access to clinical staff, methadone clinics, emergency triage and resources to cope with withdrawal and intoxication — all efforts to reduce strain on nearby emergency rooms.The city will continue to provide transitional housing at the Roundhouse Hotel until the end of June, and is currently “looking for other sites to decentralize” while “evaluating what options are available to us” in the interim, according to a spokesman for Mayor Michelle Wu.“Any reduction in services is going to negatively impact the population of people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs,” said Azzy Mae, a harm reduction activist and member of the New England Users Union, a local advocacy group for people who use drugs. “With the warmer months approaching, it’s important that the services are near where folks are congregating. It’s definitely not the time to be reducing services.” The closure comes after months of stalled negotiations between Boston Medical Center and neighborhood groups on a memorandum of agreement about a long-term plan and final end date for services at the Roundhouse. “It’s not that the services aren’t necessary, just not there,” said Sue Sullivan, executive director of the Newmarket Business Association, who suggested the creation of an “enclave” of housing and clinical support in another part of Roxbury, Dorchester or South Boston. “I see loitering, vandalism and aggressive panhandling. For those reasons, all the neighboring businesses will be very glad to see them leave.”The Roundhouse is one of several low-threshold housing sites established for unhoused people at Mass. and Cass, including Willow at Woods Mullen, Southampton Dorm 1 and the Envision Hotel. The city budgeted $21,269,552 in federal funding to support these sites through the end of this year, and 180 residents are currently living across six sites, according to data provided by the city. Other services will continue in the area, including city- and federal grant–funded programs and clinical services at the Engagement Center on Atkinson Street, harm reduction efforts through the AHOPE program, and city collaborations with nonprofits including the Whittier Street Health Center and Victory Programs, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. “We are grateful to our partners at BMC for their collaboration in supporting the city’s public health response to the substance use and homelessness crises at Mass. and Cass,” a Boston Public Health Commission spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the commission will continue “to direct individuals to their day spaces so they can access the wraparound services they need.”People experiencing homelessness have been “forced into a concentration at Mass. and Cass,” May said, an already disenfranchised area of the city that has grappled for years with a lack of resources and support. “If we want to decentralize, if we want folks to be enmeshed in society in a way that they can be accepted, then we need to have programs all over the place,” they said. “But in the meantime, we need to meet people where they’re at — and not just in a philosophical sense. We need proximity.”",Local,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:43:41 EST",a71c05e77049b7de6204966a2e240bc4
2304,Program to recruit more nurses of color in Boston gets $20M boost,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/20/program-to-recruit-more-nurses-of-color-in-boston-gets-20m-boost,UMass Boston and Mass General Brigham leaders say hundreds of nurses from underrepresented communities can help reduce health inequities.,"A program aimed at recruiting and retaining more nurses of color in the Greater Boston region has received a $20 million boost in funding from its overseeing organizations.The Clinical Leadership Collaborative for Diversity in Nursing program at UMass Boston, a collaboration between the college and Mass General Brigham, has offered financial and mentoring support to around nine students each year since it started in 2008. With this increased funding, the program now plans to support about 400 students over the next five years in order to address inequities and further diversify the nursing workforce.Gaurdia Bannister, executive director of the Institute for Patient Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said nurses are in a unique position to improve patients' health outcomes because they spend more time with patients than other clinical staff. And she says being a nurse of color or bringing a particular cultural competence can “really help move the dial” on long-standing and worsening health inequities in Massachusetts.“And I can tell you, these students are extraordinary,” Bannister said. “They are so passionate about wanting to become nurses and have overcome challenges. ... Sometimes these students may be a little bit older, so they have families that they need to take care of. Some of them are immigrants. They're committed, though, to staying.”Lindsey Desameau, who graduated from UMass Boston’s nursing school in May and will soon be working at Brigham Women’s Hospital, received three semesters of tuition assistance and stipends amounting to around $17,000. She was also assigned an experienced nurse mentor who, like her, is Haitian American. She recognizes how her background can help patients.“I've even had doctors come up to me and knowing that I speak Haitian Creole say ‘Can you come in and translate for us and kind of have that small talk with the patient?’ And it's been a tremendous change for that patient,” said Desameau. UMass Boston Chancellor Marcelo Suárez-Orozco told GBH News the increased funding for the program, to support more students like Desameau, will be transformational.“Nursing is the vertebrae of our healthcare system,” he said. “So we need to address nursing shortages. We need to improve patient care. Nurses are at the forefront of cost effectiveness, health promotion, prevention and really adapting to the evolving needs of the patient population.”Katie Murphy, the president of the Massachusetts Nursing Association, said she is concerned about nursing shortages in the state, but believes that working conditions, including staff-to-patient ratios that her union feels are too low, have caused nurses to leave Massachusetts after graduating.“From our point of view, I mean, if you look at the numbers on the Board of Registration’s nursing website, we have more nurses today than we did before the pandemic,” Murphy said. “We’re graduating nurses all over the state, a couple of thousand every year. So we don't have a nursing shortage. We really don't. But we have nurses that are not willing to work under these circumstances.”Murphy also agreed increased diversity is important for both patients and providers, but that ""we have a long way to go."" Out of the Massachusetts Nursing Association's more than 22,000 members, a recent internal survey showed about 90% are white, compared to just around 70% in the state population on the whole.Murphy said one factor in that discrepancy may be the cost and time it takes to obtain a nursing degree. There are some associate degrees, but she said a bachelor's degree is effectively required for nurses who want to find work in higher-paying hospitals.“Getting a nursing degree is expensive; and I think that that kind of reflects the systemic racism in our society as a whole.” said Murphy. “Who has the wherewithal, who's got that generational wealth to pay?”UMass Boston’s nursing school said of its approximately 1,800 current students, 20% are Black, 14% Latinx, and 13% Asian — which is close to the racial and ethnic makeup of Boston. Mass General Brigham couldn’t share demographic data on its nursing staff, but did say that 34% of its almost 86,000 total employees are non-white, with around 11% of them being Asian, 11% Black and about 10% being Hispanic.Suárez-Orozco said the investment in this nursing program and the fact most UMass Boston students stay in the area will further diversify the state's nursing workforce. He said that five years after graduation, more than 80% of all UMass Boston students are still working in Massachusetts.“The number of students from other universities that stay here in Boston is minuscule compared to our demographic,” Suárez-Orozco said. “Our bet here is that the fact that the hospitals are reaching out to us to create this partnership around like-minded approaches to the training of the next generation of nurses will prove an enduring investment in our health care, in our patient population, and the [residents] of Boston and the commonwealth.”",Local,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 13:45:21 EST",ee07bb16684ef0a9c3b9ee9e2f4ae4b7
7277,The history of enslavement at Boston's Freedom Trail sites is beginning to be told,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/19/the-history-of-enslavement-at-bostons-freedom-trail-sites-is-beginning-to-be-told,"Boston's historic ties to slavery have long been known, but rarely discussed.","Advisory: This project contains descriptions of violence and dehumanizing language to reflect the horrors that Black people and Native Americans were routinely subjected to during the era of American history when slavery was common. We recognize such language may distress some readers. Discretion is advised.SeparatorA narrow red brick path winds through the sidewalks of downtown Boston, connecting 17 historic sites tied to the city’s colonial history as the incubator of the American Revolution.But the red line of the Freedom Trail also could symbolize the blood of enslaved people who helped make that revolution possible.Boston is a cradle of American history, and 4 million people a year visit the historic churches, graveyards and parks that make up the Freedom Trail to learn more about the country’s origins.But rarely do they hear the underbelly of that story: that slavery touched nearly every aspect of the society and the economy of Massachusetts during that period of time.In the 1700s, enslaved people likely accounted for about 10% of Boston’s population, according to the city’s tally. An unnamed French writer visiting Boston in 1687 wrote, “You may ... own Negroes and Negresses; there is not a House in Boston, however small may be its means, that has not one or two.”The malicious tentacles of slavery in the Bay State were widespread, although Massachusetts was not home to the massive agricultural plantations like the Southern colonies. Boston thrived on shipping that involved transporting enslaved people or the products of their labor. The colony had a huge rum industry, made possible by the sugar harvested in the slavery-riddled Caribbean. And enslaved people in Central and South America mined the silver that Paul Revere used to manufacture his iconic kitchenware.And those connections can be tied directly to sites along the 2.5-mile Freedom Trail: in the wood harvested by enslaved workers to build the USS Constitution; in the unmarked graves at Boston's old cemeteries; and in the history of Boston Latin School, where enslaver Nathaniel Williams served as one of the first schoolmasters.In most cases, these connections are rarely talked about. Joe Bagley, the city's archaeologist, says many people don’t realize how slavery was systemic in 18th century Massachusetts. “We kind of give ourselves a lot of credit for being the first state to banish slavery,’’ he said. “But we were also the first state to make it legal.” Massachusetts was the first colony to legalize slavery, with the adoption of the 1641 ""Body of Liberties,"" which set out the rules under which a person could be enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the 1780s through a series of court cases brought by enslaved people.L’Merchie Frazier, former director of education and interpretation for Boston’s Museum of African American History, says the interpretation of the historic sites on the trail, installed in the 1950s, has completely ignored the role of Black people. “Whose freedom are we trailing and are we tracing as we walk on those bricks?” she asked. GBH News reporters worked with a group of Boston University journalism students to document the lesser known history of slavery at each of the sites along the Freedom Trail. For several months, students dug into archives and worked with researchers to piece together information. Some of the sites have done a lot of this work themselves and were able to share their findings; others, like the Old Corner Bookstore and the Boston Common, are essentially unmanaged and required students to dig through troves of documents and read historical texts looking for clues. While very little of what was found was previously unknown, there’s no easily accessible place to find all the information collected in one place.View the interactive map: Enslavement History of the Freedom TrailSuzanne Segura Taylor, the executive director of the Freedom Trail Foundation, said her organization has long trained guides to mention slavery on the tour. For example, the training materials direct guides to discuss the small grave marker beside the tomb of John Hancock, a two-time Massachusetts governor made famous for his signature on the Declaration of Independence. The small grave carries the name of “Frank,” described as a servant of Hancock’s and who was almost certainly enslaved, historians agree.“Those are the things we say that must be talked about,” she said.But she said more can be done to elevate the story of Boston’s slave history, and she hopes to share GBH’s findings with her tour guides. The Freedom Trail Foundation is just one of countless organizations leading tours of the historic sites. Last month, a GBH News reporter took a 2.5-hour walking tour with a private company that covered all 17 sites and never once mentioned slavery. “There's a lot of people out there conducting tours that we don't know what their outlines are, what they're required to discuss on their tours,” Taylor said.Frazier said the story that tourists hear about colonial Boston depends on who their guide is. “Previously on the Freedom Trail, the only mention of any Black person was Crispus Attucks — and not his history, just that he died on March the 5th, 1770,” she said.Attucks, the first person killed in the Boston Massacre on that day, is buried with other victims under a commemorative stone in the Granary Burying Ground, beside revolutionary leader Samuel Adams. GBH followed several tours through the burial ground and the massacre site and heard no mention that Attucks — the child of an enslaved Black father and a Native American mother — had once been enslaved and advertised as a runaway.Frazier also points out that the story of enslaved people in Boston is not just a story of victimhood. It is also the story of people working together to educate themselves, learn skills and try to build wealth — and fight for their freedom. It was ""a strategized, networked, organized movement to secure their voices, their land, their property,"" she said. ""If you leave out that narrative, that expanded narrative, of Black and Indigenous people here, you have really done a woeful job of delivering history. Especially in terms of considering the principles of democracy.""While there is a growing acknowledgement of the city’s ties to slavery on the Freedom Trail, the public-facing recognition of it is intermittent. For example, organizers at King's Chapel, a stone chapel founded in 1686, launched an effort a few years ago to grapple with its history. Many of the founding members, and many of the donors to the construction of the church, were slaveholders, slave traders or otherwise made their money from the the woek of enslaved people. Signs around the church now explain those connections, and the chapel recently approved a massive transformation to install a monument to the 219 enslaved people linked to the congregation’s history.Watch: How King's Chapel is reckoning with its ties to slaveryBut just outside the church, the city-owned King’s Chapel Burying Ground provides no details about slavery on its signs, even though some of the most illustrious names on its tombstones commemorate people who owned slaves, including John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts.A “First Governor” plaque in the burial ground marks the family tomb and tells the story of Winthrop’s career, noting that he was “considered religious, prudent, conscientious and pious.” No mention is made of the fact that the governor sent soldiers to sack a Pequot settlement in 1627, taking hundreds of Native American prisoners, many of whom Winthrop sold, gave away as slaves, or kept for himself.Beth Anne Bower, credited as the historical research consultant on those signs, told GBH News that when the placards were made two decades ago, exploring slavery connections “was not the conversation.” Instead, she says, she was encouraged to focus on the ""diversity"" of people buried there, highlighting women business owners and French migrants. The current recognition that “we should start confronting this history” was not part of the mission for those signs, she said. ""It should have been.""Walking past the site of Boston Latin School — the oldest school in the nation — visitors would not learn that Nathaniel Williams, one of the school’s first schoolmasters, enslaved two people identified as Richard and Hagar. This fact is not mentioned on the school's own website or on the mural painted on the sidewalk on School Street, which is named for Boston Latin. But these key details are available on other city websites. Increasingly, the sites along the Freedom Trail — which are curated by different groups, including the National Park Service, the city of Boston, individual congregations and standalone nonprofits — have begun telling the stories of the foundation of enslavement that the city’s history stands upon. The USS Constitution Museum in Charlestown, which receives hundreds of thousands of visitors a year, leads visitors through a hands-on description of how the ship was conceived and built. Dr. Carl Herzog, the historian at the museum, told Boston University students that the ""live oak"" — a particualry impregnable species of wood — that the Navy sought to build the boat in the 1790s came from Georgia’s St. Simons Island, where it was harvested by enslaved workers. In a blog post published on the museum website late last year, Herzog detailed the use of this wood: “Paying enslavers for the forced labor of enslaved people was an expediency that Navy officials and contractors saw as fundamental to the job. Thus, enslaved people were essential to the construction of naval warships built to secure the very American freedoms they were denied.”The museum exhibit includes a modern life-sized photo of a Black man dressed as an ""enslaved"" worker carrying an axe. The attached sign says ""I hate this work. My master earns top dollar for my toil, but me, what do I get... [White workers] left. I don't have that choice. Got nowhere to run.""Old North Church, where the lanterns were hung in the steeple “one if by land, two if by sea” to launch Paul Revere’s famous ride, has rewritten its own materials to expose the slave ties of the donors who funded that steeple. The Old State House has an exhibit about the petitions enslaved people submitted to the Legislature in the 1700s asking for their liberation and reparations. Stepping off the Freedom Trail, visitors can find even more of this history. The National Park Service leads tours on a 10-stop Black Heritage Trail that features an alternate slate of sites curated by the Museum of African American History, including the African Meeting House — the nation’s oldest Black church building — and the John J. Smith House, home to a leading abolitionist who helped liberate Shardrach Minkins, an enslaved man from Virginia arrested in Boston in 1851 under the Fugitive Slave Act.And the city of Boston has unveiled an exhibit inside Faneuil Hall to document some of the enslaved people who lived here and to highlight “Boston’s Complicity” in the slave trade. The location was chosen specifically to elevate the fact that Peter Faneuil, who built the building donated to Boston in 1742, was one of the most active slave traders in the colony.Some social justice leaders, like Imari Paris Jefferies, chief executive of Embrace Boston, who led the 2022 installation of the new civil rights memorial on the Boston Common, say this recognition is long overdue. “To have more of these historic and legacy institutions on the Freedom Trail tell a holistic story about Boston’s — and America's by default — involvement and engagement in this dark part of our history is an important part of reconciliation,"" he said.SeparatorThis story was reported with the assistance of a Boston University Journalism class led by professor Brooke Williams.

While getting to Logan Airport has been more difficult for travelers from other parts of the city, East Boston residents have been living with the daily impact and adjusting their routines.“I live day-to-day,” said Neelesh Batra, who is on the board of the Gove Street Citizen's Association. “People are making adjustments as we go.” For people who live in Eastie, the Sumner shutdown isn’t brand new — weekend closures started in June of last year.Batra said he’s become accustomed to adding about 30 minutes to car trips and checking the status of traffic frequently on Google Maps.Margaret Farmer of the Jeffries Point Neighborhood Association, said there have been “significant fluctuations” in the length of her commute to Newton. She’s had days when it has taken an extra 20 minutes and days when it has taken an extra hour and 30 minutes. “I ran into a neighbor and we were chatting and she changed jobs — to avoid having to drive,” said Farmer. “I think it's genius, actually.”Emergency response has also been a critical concern for Eastie residents during the tunnel closure. While East Boston Neighborhood Health Center recently completed renovations to its emergency department, there are concerns around treating cases of more severe trauma. The Ted Williams Tunnel closed twice last Thursday to transport organs to major hospitals.Availability of ambulances is also a concern for those who need to get to a downtown hospital. Carlos Rosales, an East Boston resident who received a kidney transplant last November, expressed concern about how he would get to the hospital in current traffic conditions.“I can't imagine if I was waiting for a transplant and I get the call at three in the afternoon on a Friday,"" he said. ""I'm missing the window … I'm not getting there without a police escort or an ambulance.”The increased number of idling cars in traffic has also left residents wondering about the impact on air quality.“You can't mask it, it's there and it's constant and if you don't drive, you’re still going to breathe in that air because it's backed up into the community,” said Joanne Pomodoro, a community advocate. “It goes into all of what we breathe.”Residents have access to some alternatives during the shutdown. The Blue Line is free, and there are reduced parking rates at Beachmont, Suffolk Downs, Orient Heights and Wonderland stations.Lifelong East Boston resident Roxanne Curzi said the Blue Line has been running “pretty smoothly.””I've been using it more lately,” she said. But the gates are only open at the Blue Line, so if she transfers to a different line, “when I want to come home, I still have to pay.”Five bus routes from Chelsea are free, while the 120, which runs between Orient Heights and Maverick, and 121 between Wood Island and Maverick, were not included in the mitigation plan as free routes. The pilot East Boston Ferry service from Lewis Mall to Long Wharf is operating for free during the closure. The Blue Line also covers a similar route from Maverick to Aquarium station.“The solution’s transit,” said Chris Marchi, a longtime community activist with Airport Impact Relief Inc., a neighborhood environmental organization. “And we can do it. But you got to make it a better option.”He stressed expanding the Logan Express bus service as a possible solution to curbing airport drop-offs. Tickets for the Logan Express are 25% cheaper during the closure.Marchi has lived in the neighborhood his whole life and says this shutdown has been another challenge.“You know, most of the time neighborhoods in Boston, particularly East Boston, you know, they sort of take it on the chin and they roll with it … And this is a tough one to roll with.”",Local,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 14:32:37 EST",918573d58987397b320514cbff5f715d
3933,DiZoglio: Legislators who back her State House audit afraid to speak out,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/17/dizoglio-legislators-who-back-her-state-house-audit-afraid-to-speak-out,"If House and Senate leaders balk at sharing information, she plans to use persuasion before going to the courts.","State Auditor Diana DiZoglio said Friday that many of her former colleagues in the Massachusetts House and Senate support her controversial audit of the state Legislature, but fear that voicing their support publicly will lead to retribution.“There are a lot of legislators who actually welcome the opportunity for an audit — but understand that they may be retaliated against if they support such an effort,” DiZoglio told Adam Reilly on GBH News’ Talking Politics. “A lot of folks have expressed to me that, you know, they might be supportive, but fear that if they do express that publicly that their district will be punished, that their community will be punished,” she added. In her 2022 campaign, DiZoglio had vowed to audit the Legislature if elected, and earlier this month she followed through. On March 7, she delivered formal notifications — know as letters of engagement — to House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka, telling them she plans to review “budgetary, hiring, spending and procurement information ... information regarding active and pending legislation, the process for appointing committees, the adoption and suspension of House and Senate rules and the policies and procedures of the House and Senate.”In a statement issued after DiZoglio’s announcement, Spilka questioned both the need for DiZoglio’s audit and the auditor’s authority to conduct it. In her interview with GBH News Friday, DiZoglio did not directly answer a question about what her audit could reveal about the Legislature that isn’t already known. Later in the interview, however, she said that “information regarding active and pending legislation” could include communications between legislative leaders and rank-and-file members about how leadership expects them to vote on certain bills.“Certainly conversations could be part of an audit — conversations with staff, conversations with legislators,” DiZoglio said.DiZoglio also said that, as of March 17, neither Mariano nor Spilka had directly responded to the notification letters sent to them 10 days earlier, and that no specific information has yet been requested from either chamber.Those same letters also state that, when DiZoglio does request specific information, the House and Senate will have 72 hours to provide it.If legislative leaders don’t meet that expectation, DiZoglio said, she’ll try to persuade them to cooperate before pursuing a legal remedy. “I hope that the courts do not have to be involved in this conversation,” she said. “They shouldn’t have to be involved in this conversation. That is a path that I said I would take if necessary, but ... I’m hoping that legislative leadership will come around.”Critics have contended for years that the Massachusetts Legislature is opaque to a fault. Among other things, a 1997 Supreme Judicial Court decision that many consider misguided exempts the House and Senate from state public-records law, and the votes taken by House members on key committee votes are not shared with the public.Watch: DiZoglio pushes forward with legislature audit despite pushback from lawmakersTell us: Do you support DiZoglio’s push to subject the Massachusetts Legislature’s private workings to public scrutiny?

Many local and state governments are developing initiatives for reparations to balance the scales.Here in Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu marked the start of Black History Month by announcing the members of a new task force to study reparations, noting the ""brutal practice of enslavement"" along with policies such as redlining, the busing crisis, exclusion from secure and stable housing, and more. The task force — a multigenerational group of historians, activists and students — is planning on meeting soon to discuss their ideas on how to approach the complexity of reparatory justice. As they do the meticulous work of documentation and reflection over the next year, the city will wait to look with a careful eye at their conclusions. Addressing systemic racism and the harms caused by slavery is about more than just financial compensation for descendants of enslaved people. Guests on Basic Black said the efforts should also work to address other challenges facing the African American community such as health care access, housing access, psychological harm and the erasure of Black history, among many other issues. Carrie Mays, a member of Boston's Task Force on Reparations and student at UMass Boston, said reparations should be viewed as a starting point for further conversation and work. ""Reparations is not going to stop police from killing Black men in the streets,"" Mays said. ""Reparations is not going to stop Black women from dying at the highest demographical number when it comes to the medical field. Reparations is not going to stop the mass incarceration machine system that we're seeing today."" Even though slavery was abolished more than 150 years ago, Mays said reparations are important because Black communities are still suffering at the expense of white supremacy, and white communities are still benefitting from privilege. ""You cannot talk about the systemic issues of today without talking about slavery, without talking about colonialism, without talking about how this is a connected timeline,"" Mays said. George “Chip” Greenidge, a task force member and founder and director of Greatest MINDS, said he's proud of Mayor Wu for taking on this initiative, which he said has been brewing for quite awhile. ""I really want to push on intergenerational poverty that we've seen in the city. I think there are certain families born and raised here that have been in the cycle of intergenerational poverty,"" Greenidge said. ""How can we help them break through those cycles?"" Overall, there simply won't be enough money to compensate all descendants of slaves, said Traci Griffith, director of the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. That's why compensation will have to come in more creative ways that address harms such as redlining, busing and other inequities. ""I would really strongly urge the task force to look at the multiple ways in which compensation could happen. It isn't necessarily a dollar amount. It really feels as if there's so many other ways in which it can be addressed, and I think they really need to be creative about that,"" Griffith said. The Boston Task Force on Reparations has 10 members. It is currently looking for a research partner to aid in studying the lasting impacts of slavery in Boston. A request for proposals will soon be issued.Watch the latest episode of Basic Black tonight at 7:30 p.m. on GBH 2 or live at the stream below. You can also watch on the GBH News YouTube channel.

Harris discussed recent Supreme Court rulings, Boston’s complex history in the legacy of civil rights, challenges to our democracy, the power of Black women voters, and her love for hop-hop music and former Boston mayor Marty Walsh. The transcript below has been lightly edited for clarity.Paris Alston: We caught up with Vice President Kamala Harris at the 2023 NAACP convention. We talked about Boston busing and the issues facing Black Americans today. Well, Madam Vice President, thank you so much for joining us here at the 114th NAACP Convention. We know that you could have been anywhere in the country, in the world today. So we appreciate you making time to be here.Now, I want to go ahead and set the tone here to let you know that we all have at least one thing in common, and that is love for Tupac Shakur. I know that's true for you because you are a Bay Area girl.Harris: It is true.Alston: And Jim in fact babysat him.Harris: You're kidding me.Braude: His mother was my paralegal when I was a young legal services lawyer. I can't believe she's bringing this up.Harris: Oh my goodness. Wow.Braude: We can talk after.Alston: Yeah, you have to hear that story. And I'm just a big hip hop lover, so that's for me, too.Harris: Me, too. And 50th anniversary, right?Alston: Yes.Harris: Although it's so funny, because people are now, you know, younger hip hop lovers are now talking about, Oh, you like the classic hip hop, right?Alston: Hey, listen, it's all relevant. It all builds on one way or another, right. So why was it important for you to be here at the convention today?Harris: Well, first of all, I am a lifetime member of the NAACP, and so we can start with that. And for a number of reasons, I am. But also Boston's relationship to the work of this organization is historic. Boston was the first chartered chapter of the NAACP. This is the I'm told, the first time in 40 years that the convention has been held in Boston.And, you know, you combine all of that with this moment in time.Alston: Yeah. I mean, let's talk about that, because we know that part of the reason it took so long for the convention to come back to Boston is because the last time that it was here in 1982 was right in the aftermath of the 1970s’ busing crises which helped earn Boston the racist reputation that it has around the rest of the country.Now, you're familiar with busing. You are a product of that. We know that from that moment that happened between you and the president during the 2020 presidential debates. But where does Boston, a changing Boston fit into the current landscape of civil rights?Harris: Well, let's first talk about the moment we're in and then put it in that context and the moment that we are in and our country is that I believe there is a full on attack against hard won, hard fought rights and freedoms. And this is a moment in time that we need to recognize that that is, in fact, taking place.And then do what we must to renew ourselves to the work that took place here in Boston those many years ago. That was about coalition building. It was about fighting for the foundational principles of our country. It was a fight that was fueled and in so many ways based on love of country and our true and earnest belief in the promise of our country.And so when I think about us being here in Boston, in the midst of the highest court in our land, taking a fundamental constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America. When I look at the attack on an educational system where there are those who would dare to suggest that enslaved people benefited from slavery.When I look at those who would suggest that it is a bad, if not horrendous idea to focus on issues like diversity and equity and inclusion. And I contrast that with the fight that originated here in Boston around education, around desegregation, around fairness, around justice. I think that it's a very good coincidence that we are here in Boston at this moment in time.Braude: We talk about the tsunami of rights reversal, Madam Vice President. We have a Supreme Court. Three of the Trump selections are in their fifties. Could be there 30 years, not just affirmative action, reproductive freedom. We've spoken about loss, climate justice, voting rights. The president [of the] United States has said no to what a lot of Democrats are calling for, expansion of the courts.If that's off the table in terms of the administration, what is on the table to stop, as I said, this tsunami that could go on for decades?Harris: Well, first of all, you know, the issue of the court has been a long standing priority for those of us who attempt to get people to vote. And often for many election cycles, the most important and the least persuasive is, I think, now because of these recent decisions by the court in the last couple of years — well, you could argue since 2013 — shall be the holder which gutted the Voting Rights Act, that there is a renewed understanding of the importance of that court and the connection between that and elections.Harris: So part of it is we have to remind people that elections matter and not only elections that are about the United States Supreme Court, but the federal judiciary as a whole, which is the feeder for the Supreme Court, local elections, and in particular things that are happening that affect the rights and justice for people at a local level as much as at a federal level.Braude: And you might argue that there's no greater segment of the population to whom it matters more than Black Americans. I think you would agree there wouldn't be a Biden-Harris administration had it not been particularly for Black women, but Black voters in general.Harris: There's no question about that.Braude: But the numbers are down there. The support is weaker. There was a poll in the Washington Post not too long ago where how have the Biden-Harris policies affected your life? 49% of Black Americans said they've made no difference at all. Are you worried about that? I mean, where's the disconnect?Harris: Well, that tells me that we have more work to do, which we are doing, which is to inform people about what we have achieved and to also thank them by reminding them that it was because they voted in historic numbers, Black Americans voted in historic numbers. Young voters are off the charts. It's historic numbers in the height of a pandemic in 2020.And here's what happened when they voted. They changed the whole terrain on the issues, for example, like what we are doing around the medical debt issue. Now, for the first time, we are capping the cost of insulin for seniors [at] $35 a month. For the first time, we are allowing Medicare to negotiate against the pharmaceutical companies for drug prices.We are finally addressing medical debt as a whole and capping prescription medication to $2,000 a year for seniors. We are dealing with issues like gun safety. For the first time in 30 years, we've been able to pass legislation that gets us closer to where we need to be about reasonable gun safety laws as it relates to background checks and things of that nature.We have done the work that has been about one of my passion projects, which is dealing and highlighting with the issue of maternal mortality. We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world and we have one of the highest rates of maternal mortality. Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die in connection with childbirth.And we have elevated this issue to the stage of the White House, so much so that I issued a challenge over a year ago that states would expand postpartum care from two months to 12 months. When I started, three states were doing it, now 35 are doing it. These are some of the many examples and the challenges.But it is it is absolutely a challenge. We will meet to let folks know that when they voted, it made a difference. There is a nexus between them standing in line and achieving this goal.Alston: Madam Vice President, you're listing all of these accomplishments that the administration has made so far. But we also know you mentioned young voters. I mean, that's my age group, 18 to 34. Right. But we know that patriotism is declining among that age group right now. So how do you make people confident about casting a reelection vote for the Biden-Harris administration in 2024, getting all of that?Harris: Listen, first of all, let's agree, folks got a lot going on. They are trying to get their kids to school. They are trying to get to work. They are trying to just get through the day. So I fully and our administration fully recognizes that we have to be able to talk to them where they are, which is why I'm traveling around the country, which is why today I'm in Boston and I was in Iowa yesterday.I'll be I'll be in Florida next week and talking with folks where they are and letting them know that we heard them and we continue to hear them about their highest priorities. So you look at, for example, young voters. I've been traveling the country, meeting with our young leaders who in particular are talking to me about the climate crisis.They turn me on to a term I've not heard before as to tell me how you all are thinking about the climate crisis. And they shared with me a term “climate anxiety.” They're concerned about their future in almost a doomsday fear about what might be within a couple of decades of now. They are concerned about whether they should have children, whether they should even try to buy a home, because what does the future hold for that prospect?So what did we do as an administration? First of all, we put ourselves back into international cooperation around things like the Paris Agreement. But more importantly, what we have also done is we have, by my calculation, invested $1 trillion over the next ten years in a clean energy economy that is about resilience, adaptation and what we need to do to get in front of this issue and for America to be a global leader on this issue.That is one example of an issue that is impacting young people who will be young voters when they see the connection between their vote and outcomes.Braude: Madam Vice President, you talked about fear. When you look at the numbers, tens of millions of people in this country, roughly 75% of Republicans, support a guy who's been adjudicated a sexual abuser, likely an insurrectionist. The number two man in the race is somebody, as you referenced, [who] believes apparently that slavery was a job training program. I mean, I know the goal is to get one more vote than the opposition, but isn't it dangerous, horribly dangerous, for this country when maybe 70, 80 million people support people who believe those kinds of things?Harris: I would not pretend to offer you a full and concise explanation for why people support the person you are referring to. I think there are a myriad of reasons. I also believe this, and I truly do. I have traveled our country back and forth, and when I'm sitting down with folks, whether it is in red states and blue states, and I will tell you, I've been in just about as many red states as I have blue states.As vice president, when you're sitting down in a one-on-one conversation with, for example, seniors, whoever they voted for or will vote for. Capping insulin at $35 a month, big deal to them. Student loan debt. That's not about a red state blue state thing. We're fighting to relieve student loan debt that. So I do believe that the American people as a whole recognize that true leadership is about lifting people up, not beating them down.And I'm not giving up.Braude: Before you go, one very quick thing. We were talking to somebody yesterday who says he's a close friend of yours, local guy. He said he visited you last week. So, on behalf of the people of Boston, we have a question: what do you actually see in Marty Walsh? What is that about?Harris: I love Marty. I love Marty.Braude: Why?Harris: You know why? I will tell you why. He is a Bostonian to his core in that, in my long experience with people from Boston, you don't take any B.S. You shoot straight. You call it for what it is. You've got heart, you've got soul and you love our country and you care about working people.Alston: And you started in the trenches. As a union laborer.Harris: Yeah. We started from the bottom.Alston: And now we're here!Braude: We'll tell Marty what you said. Madam Vice President, we really appreciate your time. Thank you so much.Harris: Thank you both. I appreciate it.",Politics,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 12:25:20 EST",d6fa01a0b8c7ca34d684385ca2089d1a
3863,Trump's attorney tells NPR how he plans to defend against the latest charges,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/03/trumps-attorney-tells-npr-how-he-plans-to-defend-against-the-latest-charges,"A grand jury has indicted Trump on four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States.","Former President Donald Trump has been summoned to appear in federal court on Thursday for his arraignment on charges that he participated in a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. A grand jury has indicted Trump on four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States.While this is the third criminal indictment for Trump, it is the first tied to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He has denied all wrongdoing related to the 2020 presidential election. John Lauro is one of Trump's attorneys in this case and pushed back against special counsel Jack Smith's call for a speedy trial, saying that the right to a speedy trial belongs to defendants rather than the government.""This is going to be one of the biggest cases in the history of the United States,"" he told NPR, saying his legal team wants ""enough time to study the documents, be able to interview witnesses and look at the evidence in its totality.""Lauro spoke to All Things Considered's Sacha Pfeiffer on Wednesday about his legal team's strategy in this case.So, some nuts and bolts questions first. Will Trump appear at his arraignment in person tomorrow?Yes, the arraignment is under a summons, which is a voluntary way of requesting the presence of a party before the court and obviously the president will comply.So virtual is not an option, he will be in person?It can be an option in federal court. But in this instance, it's going to be in-person in Washington. Would he like that? Are you advising him to do that?It's really up to the court. And also, it depends on Secret Service and the United States marshals. Certainly, we have no objection to appearing in court, and that's the way that it is going to roll out. In previous interviews, you have said that you would like a trial moved out of Washington, D.C. — which, as you've pointed out, voted heavily for Joe Biden — and perhaps moved to West Virginia. Why West Virginia in specific?Well, we're looking for a more diverse area that has a more balanced political jury pool. You know, the country is very, very divided politically right now, this is a very divisive indictment. It goes to issues of free speech and political activity. So, we're looking for a jury that will be more balanced. And West Virginia was a state that was more evenly divided. And we're hoping for a jury that doesn't come with any implicit or explicit bias or prejudice. So it makes sense to go to a place like West Virginia.The special counsel, Jack Smith, has said this will be a speedy trial. Do you have any objection to try to bring this case to trial before the November 2024 election?Well, speedy trial rights belong to the defense, not the government. The government has an obligation to turn over a lot of material and a lot of information, which they've not done yet, but they will. You know, the special counsel has, or the Biden Justice Department, has been investigating this case for three and a half years. And it just seems to me, in fairness, that we should have enough time to study the documents, be able to interview witnesses and look at the evidence in its totality, address a lot of legal issues with the judge as well. So what we want is a just trial, not simply a speedy trial. There's no need to railroad any defendant in the United States. And we're hoping the Justice Department will recognize that justice is more important than speed.Do you have any sense of whether you could be ready for a trial before the November 2024 election?Well, it depends on what information is provided. This indictment literally lists election issues in seven states. So we'll be litigating a case of unprecedented magnitude. I've been involved in large white collar cases for many years, over 40 years of practicing law, this is going to be one of the biggest cases in the history of the United States. The trial could last six months or nine months or even a year. So to expect that counsel is going to get ready in 90 days for a case like this is quite absurd.And this is looking quite ahead, but if it does go to trial, do you anticipate that Trump would testify in the case, that you would advise him to?Well, we have to see what the evidence is, but we're in an election cycle. The Biden administration decided to bring an indictment against a political opponent in the middle of a campaign. And the thought of President Trump having to spend his time at trial instead of actively debating and talking about the issues against his political opponent is something that I think the judge is going to consider. But more importantly, we have a challenge ahead to get ready. And there's a massive amount of information and we're entitled to look at it.I want to talk a little about your legal strategy. Could you give us a summary of your legal defense to these criminal charges?Well, it's not a big surprise. When you look at this indictment, it doesn't really say much other than President Trump was exercising his right to talk about the issues and advocate politically for his belief that the election was stolen and was improperly run. He got advice from counsel — very, very wise and learned counsel — on a variety of constitutional and legal issues. So, it's a very straightforward defense that he had every right to advocate for a position that he believed in and his supporters believed in. And this is the first time in the history of the United States where a sitting administration is criminalizing speech against a prior administration. It's really quite unprecedented and it really will politicize the criminal justice system, which is terrible to see.So prosecutors are saying that these are criminal acts, but you're making the argument that former President Trump was exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech. Is that the case you planned to make?Exactly. And free speech encompasses political advocacy, which often involves acting on that free speech. So, for example, if I were to take a position that I believe or I don't believe, that young men should register for service, there's a Supreme Court case right on point that says I'm entitled to do that. Even though I am advocating a certain action or inaction, it's still protected by the First Amendment.So I know you have said that you believe Trump was genuinely concerned about the integrity of the election. And the prosecutors will presumably argue that Trump was lying when he said the election was stolen or may have been stolen. I heard a previous interview you did in which you said that prosecutors would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had corrupt intent, which [you argue] they will never do. Is that what you see as the government's legal burden, as proving that Trump didn't really believe the election was stolen?It's embedded in the statute that they have to prove corrupt intent under 18 U.S.C. 1512, which is the obstruction statute. And corrupt intent means that you don't believe in, not only that you don't believe in the position that you're advancing, but you're doing it for a corrupt purpose, you're doing it to obstruct a government function rather than a truth-seeking function. And here, what we will argue to the jury, and we'll win, is that President Trump was arguing for the truth to come out in that election cycle rather than the truth to be denied. Even at the end, when he asked Mike Pence to pause the voting, he asked that it be sent back to the states so that the states, in exercising their truth-seeking function, could either audit or recertify.Quick final question before we lose you. If the government can prove that Trump lied or that he had corrupt intent, will you still argue that's free speech?Well, political speech covers even information that turns out not to be true. So it's all protected by free speech. But at the bottom, the government will never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as I said, that President Trump did not believe in the righteousness of his cause.But if they can, will you say it was free speech?Well, the only way that they can even attempt to prove it is at the end of a trial. I'm going to be arguing that throughout the trial. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 17:53:00 EST",cde9d5f8d623124982b418436424d6c7

This year, elected and public safety officials have tried to make sure that does not happen again. Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, who represents South Boston, joined GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about how the city is preparing for the parade. This transcript has been lightly edited. Ed Flynn: We have absolutely zero tolerance for hate groups trying to intimidate anybody. We want a parade that's safe and welcoming to all. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our diversity. But for hate organizations to come into Boston, we have zero tolerance for them, and there's no place at all for them in this city. Paris Alston: The white supremacist group in NSC-131 made an appearance and had that banner at last year's parade. What would exactly stop someone from doing that exact same thing again? I mean, anyone could show up and display a banner. So how do you make sure that that doesn't happen? And what's going to happen if it does? Flynn: Well, I think that's the critical question you are asking. And we all support the First Amendment. But when people come in to a parade, into a public gathering, with a message of hate, a message of division and violence, that is despicable, and that's dividing people, and that is causing harm. And that's not about the First Amendment. That's about intimidating people of color, immigrant neighbors, the LGBTQ community. So certainly it's a balancing act, but as far as I'm concerned, the First Amendment doesn't apply when you are trying to intimidate people, you are trying to discriminate against people. We have seen a rise in hate crimes here in Boston, the most progressive city in the country. We have seen hate groups march through downtown Boston and through the Chinatown area, a large AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community. We also have a large LGBT community in downtown Boston. We have seen hate groups cause disruption and chaos at various hospitals, including Children's Hospital, that are assisting LGBTQ patients. We also have seen hate groups intimidating medical professionals of color at one of the prominent Boston hospitals. So it's important that we work together — not just the police, not just civil rights groups, but everyday residents of Boston. And when we see some type of demonstration beginning, or any type of intimidation, we need to call police. Let the police know about it. We also have to strengthen our civil rights units. We need to document these incidents, investigate them and educate the public. Alston: Council president, I also have to acknowledge that there has been evidence of at least some sort of divisions that are happening within the City Council throughout the past year. And of course, that has included a verbal attack that Councilor Frank Baker made on Councilor Liz Breadon, who emigrated from Northern Ireland. Now, I know we're talking about two very different things, right? But I know that people have made links between those things, and we know that what happens with our leadership in this city can sometimes be a reflection of what's going on between everyday citizens. And so what have the conversations been like among the council when we talk about how we are respecting, when we're in conversation and in discourse with one another? Flynn: Well, I think, Paris, that there has to be more civility in government, in politics. I see it on both sides that people — even good people of good will — are doing and saying things that they normally would not say. But it's about recognizing our differences, respecting each other, knowing that we're not always going to agree with each other, but we have to respect each other. And if we don't respect each other in government, residents across the city, or residents across the state, will see it. When elected officials are not acting appropriately and being disrespectful, it almost is an invitation for our citizens to act that way again. So we have to get back to the basics of treating people with respect and dignity. And that starts with us right here. Alston: So lastly, council president, we've talked about a lot of heavy stuff here, but we also have to remember that the Southie parade is meant to be a joyous occasion, right? So what are you looking forward to about this year's parade? Flynn: What I like most about the parade is we celebrate not just the contributions and sacrifices of the Irish, but also the veterans' community and our military families. I had the opportunity to serve 25 years in the United States Navy. Alston: Thank you for your service. Flynn: Yes, thank you. And in my neighborhood in South Boston, we have the highest number of men that were killed in Vietnam. It's a happy time for the parade, but it's also a time when we acknowledge the incredible sacrifices made by our military families, including our Gold Star families as well. I know they'll be at the parade and it's an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and to thank them for their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.",Local,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 10:09:42 EST",1d5ba9e1d2f5a736071d09bd7b8ce254

Because the grass was greener on the other side.In Idaho, it's not unusual to see ranchers moving a bleating herd of sheep up to higher elevation at this time of year. But the sight of 2,500 wooly beasts trotting across a highway earlier this week brought a crowd about 300 people.It was the largest turnout that Steve Stuebner, spokesperson for the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission, has seen in 15 years.""It's a novelty. Maybe they've never seen anything like that before, but it's real typical in Idaho,"" he told KTVB-TV. ""When you're out in rural parts of Idaho in the spring and summer, or fall, you could run into a cattle drive or a sheep drive.""Curious onlookers lined the road as the animals sheepishly entered the highway, guided by ranchers and steered by sheepdogs. They traveled up the road a little ways, the fluffy white herd obscuring the yellow-painted centerline amid a chorus of ""baas"" and the lead ewe's jangling bell.Leaving the open road behind, they will journey through the sagebrush-dotted foothills for a few weeks to their summer home in the Boise National Forest.This trip up to higher elevations is a tradition dating back around 100 years, the Boise-area TV station reported, and having the sheep graze in the forest helps prevent fires and invigorates plant growth.The ovine spectacle will return when the sheep are brought back down again in the fall.

Who are they? A gaggle of D.C.'s most talented teens! The members of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts concert choir joined Bono and The Edge for their Tiny Desk performance. Kirsten Holmes and Jevon Skipper are both students at the arts-centered school in Washington, D.C, and received a call from their choir director about a month earlier with the opportunity to join the rock stars in performing. The two vocalists, who aspire to use their talents to dip into the worlds of gospel, opera and R&B music, agreed to the performance with a few other classmates and members of the choir. What's the big deal? It's a Tiny Desk! Enough said, right? The performance features four songs, including a version of ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of ""Walk On."" The performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender. Though that may not have immediately impressed Kirsten and Jevon as much as some others. The Gen Z duo admitted they weren't very familiar with the Irish crooners and their band. (I guess they never had to deal with the shock of an unsolicited album showing up on their iTunes one fateful morning in 2014.) What are they saying? On learning about Bono's existence: Kirsten: I had found out prior... but [because] my parents [know]. Jevon: Not even my parents. My dad. Because I know my dad was like, 'Look them up!' So I look them up, and I see they performed at the Super Bowl. I'm like, 'Oh, they must be like big news if they're performing at the Super Bowl.' Kirsten: We're youngins. You know, we are young, so we're still learning and stuff, but it's just a wow moment. On meeting Bono: Kirsten: [He was] really chill, like down down to earth. And I love how they weren't big headed, because I know how sometimes when you're in the presence of someone with a higher status, it could be really intimidating. And I didn't feel like any of us felt intimidation from them. It was just really like a learning experience. They were like, 'Well, what do you think will fit good in this part?' Jevon: One of our friends, by accident, didn't get the words right. So he accidentally sung the wrong thing. And Bono was like, 'Oh, wait, what did you do?' He was like, 'I like that, man.' It was fun. It was funny because we all knew it was an accident, but then we kind of went along with it and Bono liked it. So we just did it. On the joy of performing: Kirsten: It was amazing, really happy. I think my moment was just seeing the people's reaction, just to allow other people to feel the enjoyment of what we are gifted to do. And it was just really good. Javon: I guess I just like the feeling that I can make someone's day with the gift that God gave me. Ever since I was younger, I just loved singing for people and making people feel better and just encouraging people. So, what now?

34,Amateur sleuths unveil the women behind 132-year-old Boston Harbor adventure journal,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/08/amateur-sleuths-unveil-the-women-behind-132-year-old-boston-harbor-adventure-journal,"“Staggered” by its beauty, a scholar snatched up the journal, with aged photographs, exquisite watercolors and descriptions of the isle.","On the toasty morning of July 15, 1891, four middle-aged women met at Rowes Wharf in Boston, boarded a boat and set sail for one of the outermost harbor islands: Great Brewster. At the time, its rugged landscape was home to little more than a smattering of structures — including ""huts of refuge"" for potential shipwreck survivors — and a single cow that roamed the island. The women were leaving their husbands, children and responsibilities behind for more than two weeks in search of adventure and the joy of female friendship. Their provisions included food, art supplies, literature and one leather-bound journal. And it’s that journal that, over a century later, mesmerized Boston-based author Stephanie Schorow when she came across the volume in Harvard’s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.“But there was one big problem with it,” Schorow said. “We knew the identity of one of the women in the diary. But we didn’t know the other three women. Now, we had their photos — but we did not have their names.”The journal detailed the cold corned beef they ate and the poetry they read by moonlight. It recorded the tides and the flora of the island. Photographs, a novelty back then, showed their rustic cottage. It was the site where they pitched a hammock and hoisted an American flag — which, at the time, had only 43 stars. They adopted their own playful language — a mix of Shakespearean and swashbuckler — sprinkling in the word “Ye” for flair. “The women in the journal were only identified by their nicknames: The Autocrat, the Aristocrat, the Acrobat and the Scribe — which, when you get down to it, are kind of weird nicknames,” Schorow said.One of the women, whose moniker was “Ye Veracious Scribe,” had already been identified as Helen Augusta Whittier, a Lowell resident whose name was found on a handwritten note in the journal. Schorow tried to focus on her other projects: she’s the author of several books on Boston’s history. But the journal — and the peculiar women who created it — kept returning to her mind, and the hunch that its creators had their own contributions to make to modern-day scholarship.Schorow made a few phone calls to solicit help identifying the women.A collection of about 10 people, almost exclusively older women, stepped forward to volunteer their research skills in 2020, when the pandemic kept them all home. Over Zoom and emails, they began by transcribing the journal, which, due to the abundance of “ye”s and antiquated penmanship, wasn’t simple.“They don’t teach cursive to students anymore. But we’re old gals. So we wrote in cursive. We could decipher it,” Schorow said. “But even then, there were some parts we’d say, ‘I don’t know what they’re saying here.’”Once the journal was transcribed, the next task was to distinguish which woman — their names still unknown — wrote which entries. One of the investigators, Allison Andrews, had previous experience evaluating handwriting and cataloguing photographs. She noticed that some of the writers used periods, and some wrote with a dash. The group stitched together census records, newspaper clippings and public records from genealogy websites. And now, after years of research, they feel confident they have identified all four women: Helen Francis Ray French was the “Ye Autocrat.” The daughter of a clothing manufacturer in Lowell, she later ran a lodging house with her husband. “Ye Gentle Aristocrat” was Sarah Elizabeth “Lizzie” Dean Adams, a founding member of two humanitarian clubs in New England.“Ye Artistic Acrobat” was Isabella Coburn, a well-known painter who studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and what’s now the Massachusetts College of Art. Coburn died of heart failure four years after the trip. And the trip’s ringleader, nicknamed “Ye Veracious Scribe,” was Helen Augustua Whittier. She never married and ran her family’s textile mill in Lowell, before founding a Boston newsletter for women and becoming a leader in New England’s women’s suffrage movement. “We can only suppose that they were trying to say to the world, ‘We can do it ourselves. Women can do it ourselves,’” Schorow said.Journal entries describe how they foraged and fished: After dinner, 2 of them, with rubbers, pails and spoons, left to go get clams. With regret, they left a ruddy sunset and soon found their friends with long face and cut hands...but no clams.Yet another page has a small, exquisite watercolor painting of a lobster with the handwritten caption: “Ye hot lobster.”Professor John Stilgoe, who teaches the history of landscape at Harvard University, first discovered the journal in a used book store while on a bike ride in Cape Ann in 1999. On the counter inside, the leather-bound volume lay open, its pages an organic collection of cursive writing, watercolors and early photographs depicting women on a remote coast. “I took one look at it and was staggered by its beauty,” he said. He pledged to the bookseller that Harvard would buy it. “And put down my own credit card and told him if Harvard didn’t buy it, I would buy it.” Harvard pounced, buying the volume sight-unseen. Stilgoe said he was not surprised the women knew how to describe, draw and paint the plants and seascape around them: He’s researched how educated American women in that era studied Latin and botany. But Stilgoe’s discovery at the bookstore was not the first time the book had been rescued. Ann Marie Allen is a retired chemist and theologian who helped solve the mystery. She said the journal has had several close calls, starting with that inaugural trip to the rustic cottage more than a century ago.“When it rained, [the roof] leaked. It poured inside the house. And they talked about running around and getting buckets to catch the water. They talked about rescuing the book that we’re talking about — rescuing that log book from the deluge that was coming through the roof,” Allen said.The last page of the journal is a watercolor painting of the island with the rickety cottage. In the margin is the handwritten note, “A small green isle — it seemed — no more.” One of the essays the women read aloud was “Westminster Abbey,” a somber reflection by Washington Irving on the fleeting of time.“And one of them made mention of memories, and things we leave behind for people to find out something about ourselves. And I just thought, those women quoted from or read that particular passage. Did they ever dream that their journal was going to be looked at over 100 years later?” Allen said.Irving wrote: Time is ever silently turning over his pages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present, to think of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten.But this leather-bound volume will not be forgotten. These modern-day sleuths have joined hands with the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands to publish the journal in June. In addition to the original entries from 1891, their book will chronicle the detective work that led to the discovery of the travelers’ identities, with proceeds going to the nonprofit. With the printing, it will preserve this snapshot of Boston Harbor’s history, and preserve the women themselves — under their own names.",Local,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 05:00:20 EST",d4dd93a77dec5ea3c5294a6a903b2f50

Spoiler: they're loving it,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/28/airbnb-let-its-workers-live-and-work-anywhere-spoiler-theyre-loving-it,"When Carrie Kissell learned that her employer Airbnb was letting people live and work anywhere, she was on a sailboat off the coast of Key Biscayne, enjoying some time off with her partner.","When Carrie Kissell learned that her employer Airbnb was letting people live and work anywhere, she was on a sailboat off the coast of Key Biscayne, enjoying some time off with her partner.The thought came to her: Why not just stay on the boat?""It was this opportunity I couldn't not take,"" says Kissell, an internal events planner formerly based in San Francisco.Her weekday routine for the next three months was typical — eat breakfast, open laptop, attend meetings, get stuff done.""And then when the workday was over, I'd close my laptop and you know, go snorkeling,"" she says.Work from home, work from the office, work from ArgentinaAt a time when more and more workers are finding themselves back in their offices at least a few days a week, Airbnb is going full throttle on flexibility. This week marks one year since the company announced its Live and Work Anywhere policy, and now, it's time to gloat.""The business has actually never performed better since we moved to this program,"" says Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson. ""It's working really well for us.""Other companies, including tech ones, are taking a very different path.The Pew Research Center found that among people whose jobs can be done remotely, just over a third are still working from home all the time, down from 43% a year ago.At Airbnb, all but a very few employees have a choice: They can work from home (anywhere in the country where they're based), or they can go into an Airbnb office (there are 26 of them around the world).Regardless of where they live, they keep their same salary.And they aren't bound by geography, with the company allowing them to work in over 170 other countries for up to 90 days per year per country. Airbnb is talking to governments abroad about making it easier for all people to work around the world.Talent doesn't want to be tied downThere is an obvious business interest here. People who can jet off somewhere with their laptops are potential Airbnb guests and hosts.Freeing people from the office has also provided savings for the company, whose office footprint is now less than half of what it was before the pandemic.Still, Stephenson insists that Live and Work Anywhere is really about winning the global war for talent.""The best talent in the world is not all within a 50-mile radius of San Francisco,"" he says.And that talent, Stephenson says, no longer wants to be tied down.Before the pandemic, 95% of Airbnb employees lived near a company office. Now, almost a quarter of employees are more than 50 miles from an office, beyond a comfortable commute.A migration out of San FranciscoSteve Stecher has gone even farther than an hour's drive.Stecher moved his family out of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco during the pandemic, and since last fall they have spent most of their time in Buenos Aires.That has dramatically changed their financial picture, says Stecher, a senior manager of quality assurance at Airbnb.""Don't repeat this to my boss, but I think it's about 30%, or maybe 40% maximum, of the cost of living in the Bay Area,"" he says.Stecher manages a team of about 140 people, many of whom have also moved out of California, but primarily to the Midwest and East Coast where they have family, he says.""We did used to have a lot of fun in person,"" Stecher says about one of the tradeoffs in his new life.Airbnb now flies teams in for regular in-person gatherings, which the company sees as critical to success.""We are not remote first. We are just being intentional about how we gather,"" says Stephenson. ""It's not a random three days a week where you hope to run into people at a water cooler.""Deploying a team called Ground Control, Airbnb works to ensure that the right people are in the right place at the right time for these large gatherings.""We're still learning the right rhythms for when people are getting together,"" Stephenson says. ""I think that's the biggest challenge that we have.""Catering to different needs, and a healthy bottom lineAirbnb added 900,000 hosts last year, reaching a total of 6.6 million worldwide. Revenue growth has been strong. Stephenson sees these as signs the company is moving in the right direction.Moreover, employees are happy. Airbnb's attrition rate is close to an all-time low and falling, the company says.And Airbnb's goal of hiring more women and under-represented minorities has gotten a boost from the new policy.""Now that we're in a live anywhere context, it really gives us an opportunity to cater to different needs,"" says Benny Etienne, a leader of Black@, the company's affinity group for Black employees. ""Within a diverse group, we all have very diverse identities and diverse realities.""So far, only about 20% of Airbnb employees have taken advantage of Live and Work Anywhere to relocate domestically or travel abroad.Etienne, who works for Ground Control out of Airbnb's Montreal office, is encouraging anyone who can take their work somewhere else to try it, at least for a week.""The change of scenery has a huge impact on your mental health,"" she says on a call from Mérida, Mexico, where she's spent most of the winter and spring.Further south, the savings that Stecher and his family have enjoyed since leaving San Francisco have allowed his wife Ana Ruiz, who worked in banking, to stay home with their children in Buenos Aires and also to travel, something the family is passionate about.""We were just in our own little world in the U.S.,"" says Ruiz, who grew up in Mexico. ""Now, to be in different parts of the world and live the culture and experience the food... and speaking a different language, it's just amazing. It's just so nice.""

George Santos surrendered to federal authorities at a courthouse in suburban Long Island on Wednesday facing thirteen counts of criminal wrongdoing.","CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. — Republican Rep. George Santos surrendered to federal authorities at a courthouse in suburban Long Island on Wednesday facing thirteen counts of criminal wrongdoing.Federal prosecutors say he allegedly ""devised and executed a scheme"" aimed at defrauding donors to his 2022 political campaign.""This indictment seeks to hold Santos accountable for various alleged fraudulent schemes and brazen misrepresentations,"" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace. ""Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself.""According to the criminal indictments, Santos claimed the money would fuel his bid for office, but instead spent the cash on luxury designer clothes and to make a car payment and pay personal credit card bills.Santos also faces a charge that in 2020, he fraudulently applied to receive unemployment benefits when he was employed and running for Congress in his first bid for public office. ""At the height of the pandemic in 2020, George Santos allegedly applied for and received unemployment benefits while he was employed and running for Congress,"" stated Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly, ina statement.Her office aided in the investigation. The freshman lawmaker pushed the boundaries of conventional political scandal after his victory in last November's midterms. It was revealed that he fabricated most of the persona presented to voters.Santos lied in interviews and campaign documents about his education, his professional accomplishments, his record as a champion volleyball player and his family's experiences in the Holocaust.He also faced multiple investigations into how he raised and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign cash, including a mysterious $700,000 gift he made to his own election effort.It remains unclear where that money came from.Santos, who has announced he plans to run for re-election in 2024 has become a pariah among many GOP leaders in New York, especially on Long Island.The influential Nassau County Republican Committee distanced itself from Santos and called for him to resign.Santos has remained defiant and at times even seemed to revel in the glare of media attention. He has previously admitted to ""embellishing"" his resume, but repeatedly denied any criminal wrongdoing. On May 6, Santos posted on Twitter a photo of a fortune cookie he said he had received at a meal. ""Life is more fun when you're the underdog competing against the giants,"" the fortune read.The Santos controversy has created a political headache for Republicans, especially in New York where GOP candidates face tough re-election fights next year. Speaking Tuesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he wouldn't demand that Santos resign. He compared the criminal charges against Santos to past cases involving Democratic lawmakers who remained in office while their cases played out.""If a person is indicted, they're not on committees, they have the right to vote, but they have to go to trial.""Phone calls to Santos' congressional offices and to his attorney have gone unanswered. Santos also hasn't commented about the charges on Twitter.Separate probes are also underway by the Nassau County district attorney in New York and the House Ethics Committee in Washington, D.C. A statement released by the House panel in April stated an investigative subcommittee will examine whether Santos ""engaged in unlawful activity"" during his 2022 campaign.

Over the course of the pilot, 42 percent of riders have saved money, with 26 percent saving $20 or more, according to the city.“Fare-free buses are better buses”, Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge said. “It really does add up, especially for lower income households.""The 23, 28 and 29 routes primarily serve residents of Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan. According to the report, most riders are considered “transit critical,” meaning they are residents who are low-income, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities or who live in households with few or no vehicles. The report found that much of the money saved by riders has been used to purchase food, save towards long-term goals and build emergency funds. “These routes serve a part of the Boston population that really depends on transit to meet their daily needs,” Franklin-Hodge said. “If there’s any group of folks that you want to make sure a program like this serves, it’s the people who need it most.""While 26 percent of riders have seen what city officials have deemed significant savings, that leaves nearly three-quarters who have not. Franklin-Hodge attributes that to the fact that the majority of the MBTA still costs money, and the majority of riders on the 23, 28 and 29 routes need to take other buses and trains. If more lines were free, savings would be even more significant, he said, adding that shows the necessity of making transit more accessible.The progress report also highlights the way fare-free transit has led to positive lifestyle changes for riders. “I go to visit my sister more and my daughter more because it’s on a straight route,” one rider who participated in a focus group said. “The 28 picks me up and drops me off down the street at my sister’s house.”A recent GBH news report analyzing ridership data before and after the launch of the pilot programs found that ridership has increased significantly since the launch of free fares, and that the fare-free lines have seen bumps in speed and ridership that buck the trend of the MBTA as a whole. The new city assessment confirms a significant bump in ridership since the pilots launched and highlights the speed benefits of going fare free.“It reduces the stress of the bus riding experience,” Franklin-Hodge said. “We have video. You can see, at some of the big stations … the speed at which you can get a full busload of passengers and get everybody on their way is night and day.”The fare free pilot is a two-year program set to remain in place through February 2024. The city of Boston is funding the program with $8 million in federal funds distributed through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to reimburse the MBTA.It’s unclear what the future of fare-free transit holds in Boston, but Franklin-Hodge said he and other city officials remain hopeful that they will be able to expand programs in the future — and he said the data from the pilot program will be helpful in proving the efficacy of free public transportation.“Where can we make further investments to give the best bang for the buck for people who rely on the MBTA?” Franklin-Hodge said. “We’re excited to push that conversation forward with leaders at the state level and here locally in the city of Boston.”",Local,"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 13:18:07 EST",8f48ec1e9d51a18a105fbbcb96aa8b6d

It could also take away significant decision-making from librarians.At a School Committee meeting this week, parents and educators spoke their minds about the proposal for almost two hours.It was clear from the public comments: both sides showed up to protect their children, their beliefs and their freedom of speech.When parent Bella Soares stepped up to the microphone Tuesday, it wasn't the first time the district had heard from her about school library books she believes are inappropriate for students. That includes an illustrated book about puberty, ""Sex is a Funny Word.”Soares is part of an organized group called Ludlow Concerned Parents, according to a meeting agenda from a 2022 Select Board meeting.The recently proposed library policy echoes Soares’ activism of the last few years.At Tuesday's meeting, she first directed her comments to the parents and educators in the auditorium who disagree with her — who say the proposed policy is exclusionary, arbitrary and discriminatory against students who identify as LGBTQ.""Get this all through your heads,"" Soares said. ""You guys are the ones that are making it [about] LGBTQ. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with pornographic books in our school — drugs, rape, obscenity books. That's what we're trying to eliminate here.""Soares then read a passage aloud from a 2005 coming-of-age novel, John Green's ""Looking for Alaska."" Soares said the book is currently available to Ludlow sixth, seventh and eighth graders.The scene depicts the start and completion of a sexual act between a teenage boy and girl, while they're watching ""The Brady Bunch.""After reading, Soares said, ""So now you tell me if this is not pornography! This is definitely pornography!""That prompted shouts from others the crowd of about 150 people. It was one of several times that night the school committee chair asked people to settle down and follow protocol.It was Ludlow School Committee Member Joao Dias who a few weeks ago proposed the new library materials policy.On Tuesday, along with the rest of the committee, Dias sat at a table at the front of the room. Surrounding him were 10 books books he had taken out from the public library — to make a point.They don't belong on the shelves of a school library, he said, and he proposed the new policy because it's needed.""We've had complaints ongoing for the past six years. I think the chairman himself said that. [And] possible lawsuits from parents,"" Dias said, ""and that's a real thing, and that's based on what's going on now, not what might be from a civil liberties union that doesn't protect any civil liberties.""The ACLU of Massachusetts has called Dias' proposal unlawful and a not-very-veiled attempt to suppress literature about LGBTQ experiences.Dias said he found the policy online, from the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania. The ACLU has challenged that district's policy with a federal lawsuit.The proposed policy in Ludlow would give elected school officials like Dias decision-making powers about materials that could override librarians. Several were at the meeting and said they were not consulted by the school committee.The policy could also lead to the firing of school employees who don't follow the rules or who encourage certain books.The majority of people speaking out at the meeting were against Dias' proposal. One called it a moral crusade; another, a culture war.Mike Kelliher, a parent and former school committee member, said it’s very sad for him to have to address the committee in this way.""This policy originated from a hate group in Pennsylvania and somehow managed to find its way onto your agenda,"" he said. ""And I think we need to know how that happened. I hope that's something that will be discussed tonight because that's important. It's important to know who's pulling the strings behind the scenes on some of our committee members.""The rancor brought about by the proposal may cover up that some parents in Ludlow have real concerns their children have access to inappropriate material.Longtime Ludlow teacher Michelle Annecchiarico stood up at the microphone and said she understands that. She herself has questioned certain books available to middle schoolers, and questioned librarians.She's told parents she'll help them do likewise, and help but none have taken her up on the offer.But no one in the schools, Annecchiarico said, is pushing porn on students or trying to sexualize them.""We are up against cell phones, social media, all-access 24/7 TV, YouTube, TikTok, 'Squid Games' ... we have kids who are allowed to watch 'Squid Games!'"" she said.At the meeting, three out of five School Committee members made statements indicating their opposition to Dias’ proposal. Things get heated.Several people said the School Committee failed the district and are getting distracted by the loudest voices.Some came to the meeting to talk about the school budget — and maybe to ask the superintendent about the 25 educators, including a couple of librarians, who are slated to be laid off.That, they said, is what school officials should have been talking about.",Local,"Mon, 29 May 2023 05:00:34 EST",900d7ce84a99bb9f46d75699d9886a24
6447,Everything you need to know about the 2023 Boston Marathon,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2023-boston-marathon,"On April 17, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square.","Here’s what you need to know about the 127th Boston Marathon, one of the city’s more-than-a-century-old traditions that brings world-class athletes, an air of excitement and standstill traffic to Greater Boston. When is the marathon? How long has it taken place?This year’s Boston Marathon is on Monday, April 17, 2023.The Boston Marathon is the oldest continually run marathon in the world, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year. This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots’ Day — the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots’ Day. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects for One Boston Day.What is the marathon route?The 26.2-mile route starts in Hopkinton and makes its way through suburbs, all the way to the finish line in Boston. Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners. After setting off along East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle and takes Beacon Street into Brookline, then through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square. How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating a certain time at another major marathon, a time that’s determined by their gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don’t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September. The other way to run the marathon is as part of the charity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who’s running the Boston Marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the “fastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.” The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men’s side are: Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who’s taking on Boston for the first time after winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men’s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women’s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya’s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia’s Atsede Baysa. The women’s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland’s Manuela Schär, who has won Boston four times; Australia’s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times. The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year. How much money do athletes win?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made this year?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes. ""So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,"" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the “The Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,” told GBH News when the policy was announced in September. ""I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work … this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.""In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allow pregnant and postpartum runners who qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. “Women who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,” said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA. Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively.Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. If you’re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square.If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. For more details on watching in person, check out the BAA’s spectator guide.What other events will be happening that weekend? The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay. April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m.",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 05:00:10 EST",97792f7e96212ea7be5a9bead7c158fe

Grieving for me is fire,” Jones, who goes by Uncle Selwyn, told GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston on Monday. “I could have sat on the couch and cried all day, all night. But when you come up in adverse conditions that we came up in, you know, nothing else to do but fight.”Last month marked the third anniversary of his nephew’s tragic murder by police in Minneapolis. Floyd’s death sparked a wave of civil rights protests around the state, country and even the world as millions of people came together to call for change. “I believe in miracles because, for three days, everybody in the world stood up and they said and called my big sister’s baby boy’s name, George Floyd,” he said.In the years since, Jones has been focused on making change. He co-founded the Hope929 Foundation, a charity focused on promoting civil rights to create positive change. He’s been advocating at state houses across the country for medical civil rights bills, which would require police officers to call for medical assistance if they see a person in medical crisis, or if a person police officers are interacting with tells them they need medical attention. The bill has been introduced in Massachusetts, but has not passed. “That would put people that came in touch in any way, shape or form with police officers to have an opportunity for health, to preserve life,” he said. And he’s been hosting a podcast, “Setting It Straight With Selwyn Jones.”“I think all the bad things that I’ve ever seen come right before my eyes,” Jones said. “I’ve been living this way and feeling this way as a Black man in the South forever. And I had an opportunity to move forward, to make a difference.”He has seen some progress in the last three years, he said: Some states have outlawed no-knock warrants, for instance. But the task of eliminating racism is a big one. In the summer of 2020, Americans poured into the streets to protest Floyd’s murder, painted streets with the words “Black Lives Matter” and put out a barrage of anti-racist corporate statements. Now, there are more frequent reports of white supremacist groups and book bans. “We don’t live in a perfect world and things will never be perfect. But things have to change,” he said. “The one thing that we really need to get rid of, and I don't think it will ever happen in my lifetime, is racism. ... No matter what we do, we still had to put our foot on that and keep the pedal to the metal and just keep pushing, keep pushing for change, keep pushing for different opportunities for people to hear our voice.”And a harsh reality is that, in the years since people chanted George Floyd’s name, there have been many more names of people killed by police officers. And the turning point — the point at which such protests are no longer necessary — is distant. “I will never see it. I will be dead and turned to dust,” Jones said. “But I know my whole process here, dear, is to plant the seed. If you plant the seed, it will grow.”Success does come, he said, even in “in small bits and pieces.”“There are going to be a lot of more names. My name might be one of the names. You never know,” Jones said. “But all I know is this: Winners win because of the fight that we put into the battle.”He has hope for younger generations, he said. “I just want to make it so you can walk down the street, my dear, and people say, ‘Look at that beautiful Nubian princess,’ ‘Look at that beautiful Black woman,’” he told Alston. “We’ve been stripped of our heritage. We’ve been stripped of our music, we’ve been stripped of our religion. We’ve been stripped of it. We don’t even have our own last name. Guess what? We don’t ever give up. We fight to the end. Because if we didn’t fight, where would we be?” This Juneteenth, he said, he wants to see people of color from different backgrounds more united. “All people of color, we should bow our heads and we should say, ‘Hey, man, this was the start of a long road that we’ve been fighting for a long, long, long time,’” Jones said. “Let’s continue to stay together and fight like heck, and make this place a better place for us.”",Local,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 05:00:06 EST",ccc5a864bb1a5e11c80e09e98dbbfdea
4954,Cannabis commission chair wants to relax regulations to help businesses 'thrive',https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/26/cannabis-commission-chair-wants-to-relax-regulations-to-help-businesses-thrive,"“Ratcheting” back regulations is both an economic and social justice issue for cannabis business owners, said Shannon O’Brien.","When Massachusetts residents voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016, communities braced for what new cannabis stores would mean for their neighborhoods.“It was like an opium den is coming to the neighborhood,” Shannon O’Brien, the chair of the Cannabis Control Commission, saidon Boston Public Radio on Wednesday. O'Brien said commissioners at the time tended to overregulate the new cannabis business landscape, knowing they could pull back regulations later on. Now, cannabis use and dispensaries are more normalized. She said it’s time to reevaluate some of the most restrictive regulations that “may or may not protect health and safety.”For example, all marijuana businesses in Massachusetts are required to have on-site video surveillance and store the footage for 90 days so that it’s accessible for law enforcement and regulators. “Maybe we only keep it for 60 days, so maybe you could save $3,000 a month in your cloud storage fees,” said O’Brien. “So that's what I'm trying to do, is make sure that those businesses can thrive and profit, even though the price of cannabis has gone down by half.”The commission is also focused on promoting active involvement and benefits for people who've been disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs. The reality of getting those people involved is another story. O’Brien said close to a thousand people have gone through the Cannabis Control Commission’s social equity or economic empowerment programs. Certain application fees get waived, they are put at the front of the line, and they have access to training. The disconnect between this preparation stage and licensing their business is money, said O’Brien, which is particularly difficult during the startup phase. Even if a cannabis entrepreneur has demonstrated they have a revenue stream, most banks will not work with them because marijuana is illegal at the federal level. To close this gap, the Social Equity Fund was established in 2022, which is supposed to set aside 15% of cannabis fees and taxes in fund for those entrepreneurs from communities disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement. This could be some $15 million to $20 million per year, said O’Brien. “But the problem is that's assessed at the end of the year,” she said. “It’s a timing issue.” O’Brien said she’s been working with Keisha Brice, the chair of the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board, which administers the fund, to work on how funding could be more continuous and accessible year-round for social equity candidates. While the infrastructure for the fund is worked out, O’Brien said she’s looking for ways to collaborate with outside groups to support entrepreneurs of color. Four hundred “social equity” entrepreneurs have been provisionally licensed, O’Brien said. “I think we should be focusing on those 400 applicants, that have demonstrated the ability, and then figure out how we get them over the line to get them to commence operations,” she said.Another plan currently on hold is establishing social consumption sites for cannabis. The Cannabis Control Commission wrote a pilot program for these sites in 2019. When asked how long until the public can expect to see these sites in their communities, O’Brien said, “I can’t answer that question.”“You should bring commissioners Camargo and Stebbins to come in and talk about it,” she said. Those commissioners are in the process of hearing from stakeholders about the potential impact of these consumption sites. O'Brien said she has requested a Nov. 9 deadline to determine next steps.",Local,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:30:35 EST",5460794b75a1769dd7ccd91b2b185ed8
683,East Boston gets a revamped emergency department amid Sumner Tunnel closure,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/17/east-boston-gets-a-revamped-emergency-department-amid-sumner-tunnel-closure,The East Boston Neighborhood Health Center announced Monday its emergency department renovations were complete.,"The East Boston Neighborhood Health Center announced Monday it has completed renovations to its emergency department, creating an early diagnosis program and expanding emergency and urgent care.“What was really important is that every inch of this has been rebuilt,” said Greg Wilmot, president and CEO of East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, as he led a tour of the facility. Enhancements include a new layout for easier navigation of the space, oxygen hook ups in the 12 patient rooms, vending machines with healthy food options, a behavioral health safe room and more privacy in triage and registration areas.Other updates fall under the umbrella of early diagnostics, such as a state-of-the-art CT scan machine and point of care ultrasound, which will give patients more opportunities for imaging on site. “We believe these powerful tools will help mitigate transfer out of our facility … which will actually expedite their care and provide a better experience for them and better clinical outcomes and better satisfaction for our staff here at the health center,” said Dr. Jackie Fantes, chief medical officer at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center.Emergency response time and capabilities have been a major concern during the Sumner Tunnel closure, which connects East Boston to the city’s major hospitals. Wilmot said the community health center already provides relief to other local hospitals in the area. According to the center, its emergency department is the fourth busiest in the city, receiving more than 40,000 visits per year.“We expect that to continue to be the case with the improvements that we've made and the additional capacity and capability that we've created here, we'll be able to do more of that, of relieving those area hospitals,” said Wilmot. “But that's probably the extent of the role that we play here for some of that emergency care. You can stay right here in the community without having to navigate traffic.”“We're providing more services, more emergency help here on site than we've ever done before,” said state Sen. Lydia Edwards. “And so when the tunnel is closed, this to me is a bright, shining light. And one of the things that we are working on, to make sure we're not just mitigating, but providing permanent changes and services for our population.”The community health center tracks the demographics of its patients: its numbers show the facility at large cares for more than 100,000 patients annually, 70% of whom are best served in a language other than English. Last year, the facility conducted more than 205,000 interpretations.The emergency department has been open since 2009 and it's the only community health center in Massachusetts open 24 hours every day of the year. The emergency department continued to operate throughout the renovations and construction which began in November of 2021, and wrapped this January. The center opened a patient advocate office last November in response to allegations of poor treatment at the facility. It's also moving forward with plans to open a behavioral health urgent care center later this summer.",Local,"Mon, 17 Jul 2023 17:32:21 EST",718f5d00dd28c137333c9468fb0bfb52

""These new forms of medical debt can create financial ruin for individuals who get sick.""Nationwide, about 100 million people — including 41% of adults — have some kind of health care debt, KFF Health News found in an investigation conducted with NPR to explore the scale and impact of the nation's medical debt crisis.The vast scope of the problem is feeding a multibillion-dollar patient financing business, with private equity and big banks looking to cash in when patients and their families can't pay for care, KFF Health News and NPR found. In the patient financing industry, profit margins top 29%, according to research firm IBISWorld, or seven times what is considered a solid hospital profit margin.Millions of patients sign up for credit cards, such as CareCredit offered by Synchrony Bank. These cards are often marketed in the waiting rooms of physicians' and dentists' offices to help people with their bills.The cards typically offer a promotional period during which patients pay no interest, but if patients miss a payment or can't pay off the loan during the promotional period, they can face interest rates that reach as high as 27%, according to the CFPB.Patients are also increasingly being routed by hospitals and other providers into loans administered by financing companies such as AccessOne. These loans, which often replace no-interest installment plans that hospitals once commonly offered, can add hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest to the debts patients owe.A KFF Health News analysis of public records from UNC Health, North Carolina's public university medical system, found that after AccessOne began administering payment plans for the system's patients, the share paying interest on their bills jumped from 9% to 46%.Hospital and finance industry officials insist they take care to educate patients about the risks of taking out loans with interest rates.But federal regulators have found that many patients remain confused about the terms of the loans. In 2013, the CFPB ordered CareCredit to create a $34.1 million reimbursement fund for consumers the agency said had been victims of ""deceptive credit card enrollment tactics.""The new CFPB report does not recommend new sanctions against lenders. Regulators cautioned, however, that the system still traps many patients in damaging financing arrangements. ""Patients appear not to fully understand the terms of the products and sometimes end up with credit they are unable to afford,"" the agency said.The risks are particularly high for lower-income borrowers and those with poor credit.Regulators found, for example, that about a quarter of people with a low credit score who signed up for a deferred-interest medical loan were unable to pay it off before interest rates jumped. By contrast, just 10% of borrowers with excellent credit failed to avoid the high interest rates.The CFPB warned that the growth of patient financing products poses yet another risk to low-income patients, saying they should be offered financial assistance with large medical bills but instead are being routed into credit cards or loans that pile interest on top of medical bills they can't afford.""Consumer complaints to the CFPB suggest that, rather than benefiting consumers, as claimed by the companies offering these products, these products in fact may cause confusion and hardship,"" the report concluded. ""Many people would be better off without these products.""KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

It was a surreal photo with two women at the center painted white and wearing all black, sitting on these bright red chairs, vibrant blue and red and yellow hues behind them. There were eight other women in bright red cloaks who look like they're marching in a line behind them. Totally unlike anything you'd usually expect at a bus stop.I wanted to know why this weird and beautiful photo was here. So I called up the artist: Aïda Muluneh, a photographer and artist based in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. She’s also a promoter of developing photography as an art form in Africa. The photo is part of a new public art installation in JCDecaux bus shelters in New York, Chicago, Boston and Abidjan. It's called “This is Where I Am.”“I have many memories of the cold winters in Canada having to take the bus to go to different places,” Muluneh said. “I think for a lot of people that take public transportation, it's an interesting way to engage them in looking at something outside of just advertising.”Muluneh, who was born in Ethiopia and grew up in Canada and Yemen, among other places, said the public art project appealed to her because it allowed her to bring her art to more people, as opposed to having it cloistered in an institution or gallery. Her work is often colorful, carrying a distinct visual language, she said. “I know I have a very distinct visual language, which took me a while to arrive to this point,” she said. “For those that see my work, it's something that they don't forget because it has its own approach.”She brings her subjects onto sets she builds, and works with teams of artists to make props. “I utilize a lot of my heritage, my culture. I do body painting,” Muluneh said. “It's the kind of work that you'll see from quite a distance. And there's a striking element to it.”This project is the first time in her career that she’s worked in a vertical format. Usually, she said, her works are square. “I liked that challenge because it took me out of my comfort zone to think in the vertical,” Muluneh said. “To try to imagine what I wanted to say that I've been saying within a square format, and to reformat into this different style. She and her team also enjoyed the process of making public art. “It's been really an open conversation on public art that really, I think, supports the artist's vision of what we want to say,” Muluneh said. “I enjoyed working with them because it's a conversation, and it's a negotiation that we have. But at the end of the day, for me, I look at intent. And the intent to me is really to bring a different form of art into the public that would not normally engage in it, and to also engage an audience that might not necessarily go into these galleries or go into these museums.”",Local,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:07:11 EST",12b2470c97737347d09baaf3708aee2a

In her 2022 campaign, DiZoglio had vowed to audit the Legislature if elected, and earlier this month she followed through. On March 7, she delivered formal notifications — know as letters of engagement — to House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka, telling them she plans to review “budgetary, hiring, spending and procurement information ... information regarding active and pending legislation, the process for appointing committees, the adoption and suspension of House and Senate rules and the policies and procedures of the House and Senate.”In a statement issued after DiZoglio’s announcement, Spilka questioned both the need for DiZoglio’s audit and the auditor’s authority to conduct it. In her interview with GBH News Friday, DiZoglio did not directly answer a question about what her audit could reveal about the Legislature that isn’t already known. Later in the interview, however, she said that “information regarding active and pending legislation” could include communications between legislative leaders and rank-and-file members about how leadership expects them to vote on certain bills.“Certainly conversations could be part of an audit — conversations with staff, conversations with legislators,” DiZoglio said.DiZoglio also said that, as of March 17, neither Mariano nor Spilka had directly responded to the notification letters sent to them 10 days earlier, and that no specific information has yet been requested from either chamber.Those same letters also state that, when DiZoglio does request specific information, the House and Senate will have 72 hours to provide it.If legislative leaders don’t meet that expectation, DiZoglio said, she’ll try to persuade them to cooperate before pursuing a legal remedy. “I hope that the courts do not have to be involved in this conversation,” she said. “They shouldn’t have to be involved in this conversation. That is a path that I said I would take if necessary, but ... I’m hoping that legislative leadership will come around.”Critics have contended for years that the Massachusetts Legislature is opaque to a fault. Among other things, a 1997 Supreme Judicial Court decision that many consider misguided exempts the House and Senate from state public-records law, and the votes taken by House members on key committee votes are not shared with the public.Watch: DiZoglio pushes forward with legislature audit despite pushback from lawmakersTell us: Do you support DiZoglio’s push to subject the Massachusetts Legislature’s private workings to public scrutiny?

The CPA, signed into law in 2000, allows communities to add a surcharge on top of their local property taxes, and requires that participating communities devote at least 10% of the money raised to affordable housing. But according to a report released by the two organizations Tuesday, of the 195 cities and towns participating in the CPA, 70 have not hit that 10% spending mark since joining the program, though they may have set aside money for future housing investments. Communities that adopt the CPA can also use the money for open space, recreation and historic preservation, as well as affordable housing. Those priorities can sometimes be in conflict with one another — choosing to build housing on a property means it can't become conservation land, and vice versa — and it's up to the communities to decide how to spend their money. “All of these areas, they're all important, they're all part of what makes the kind of umbrella of the CPA work,” said report author Evan Horowitz, the executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis. “But you know, it's been 20 years and housing is obviously the thing everyone's talking about. It's the crisis that the state's facing, one of the biggest crises that the state is facing.”The report said CPA investments in housing are ""especially limited"" in Massachusetts suburbs, while urban areas devote more than half of their CPA spending to housing and rural areas more than 40%. The report recommends several steps the state could pursue to ""rebalance"" the CPA to consider the state's challenges of limited housing supply and soaring costs. Those measures include enforcing the 10% requirement, offering additional state money to communities that commit at least 20% of their CPA money to affordable housing, and creating a dedicated team within the state government to help smaller towns handle tasks like bidding and project management.Greg Vasil, the CEO of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said he hopes the report can spur a broader discussion about the CPA and whether there's a way to strengthen its potential as its housing production strategy. ""Is there a way to create more incentives for communities that really want to build?"" he said. ""Because I think it is a real viable tool for the creation of even more housing for those communities that want to use it in that way.""",Politics,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 13:56:39 EST",c367971d87b19edeeaa0ae3cdbb35104

She explains that crabs are related to spiders — they’re arachnids.“Araña,” one of the students says, using the Spanish word for spider. “Do they just live in saltwater?”“Yes.”The four students — Aguilar, Alejandra Garcia, Yolanda Peñaloza, and Ireri Servín — traveled to the Cape earlier this month to learn about the massive restoration project on the Herring River in Wellfleet. They hoped to see how Cape Codders gathered community support — and how to inspire similar work on a heavily polluted lake back home.East Harbor is not part of the Herring River restoration the students traveled 3,000 miles to see. The East Harbor project is smaller, but it’s farther along.Fox said it gives the students a glimpse of how a species can return even with modest changes to the water system.“This is an area where we've been finding them thriving … and we're finding baby crabs,” she said. “And so it's a very positive story of a restoration where everything has recovered into a functioning system, which is what you hope for.”The students’ visit was a leadership-development trip through a summer camp where they’re graduating the internship program and joining the summer staff.Each year, the camp centers on an issue of community concern, and this year, it’s the badly degraded Lake Pátzcuaro, a body of water that covers more square miles than the Quabbin Reservoir.A member of the camp steering committee has friends on Cape Cod. That’s how the restoration of the Herring River became the foundation of a cultural exchange.While they were here, they got plenty of support from Seashore science chief Geoffrey Sanders and his staff, plus the Friends of the Herring River and the town of Wellfleet.They learned how Massachusetts’ largest-ever estuary repair took many people, working together for decades, to plan and fund the work.In a conversation with Seashore staff, the students talked about the problems of Lake Pátzcuaro and their goals for the future.Peñaloza, 20, who is studying medicine, said healing Lake Pátzcuaro requires community organizing.“We have four municipalities around the lake,” she said. “The sewage and the garbage goes to the lake. … So we want to know how to organize the four municipalities to work under one umbrella.”Aguilar, a business administration student, said the lake is also compromised by agricultural chemicals from the growing of avocados in the Lake Pátzcuaro basin.“People have cut down many of the last forests in the basin in order to plant avocados, which … need a lot of water and a lot of toxic chemicals,” she said. “And when it rains, the runoff sends all these chemicals into the lake.”Later in the day, the students visited Duck Harbor with Seashore staff. The low-lying land behind a bayside beach in Wellfleet is connected to the upper reaches of the Herring River, so it’s part of the project to restore tidal flow.As they looked out over the place where trees have died and salt marsh plants are returning, Restoration Ecologist Tim Smith told the students that Duck Harbor is also being inundated from the bay side by sea-level rise.“These plants … everything that’s green, which are just short, little stubby plants — they can handle being flooded every day, twice a day, by salt water,” he said.The study trip, organized by the Campamento de la Paz, or Peace Camp, caught the attention of Linda Bennett from the international affairs office of the National Park Service.She decided it was important enough to meet the students on the Cape.“I thought it was such a valuable program they were going to do here, to learn from the park, present their case, develop some solutions, and go back into their community in Mexico and actually apply them,” she said.And she said the Seashore benefits, too, by hearing about shared phenomena, such as invasive species, and making international connections.When the students returned home, they planned to meet with the mayor of Pátzcuaro to share what they’ve learned.They’re taking a stand, not only for their own futures, but also for civic activism to heal the lake they love.",Local,"Fri, 04 Aug 2023 05:00:20 EST",9598f0a163e7254b9d978487c14b6c65
42,Boston City Council approves Wu's rent control and city planning proposals,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/08/boston-city-council-approves-wus-rent-control-and-city-planning-proposals,Two major pieces of Wu’s agenda now move forward to state lawmakers.,"The Boston City Council Wednesday approved proposals to implement rent control and restructure the city’s planning and development agency, advancing two major pieces of Mayor Michelle Wu’s legislative agenda forward to state lawmakers.Both measures passed 11-2, with Councilors Frank Baker and Erin Murphy voting against them. In a rare, post-vote media appearance, Wu said the council ""delivered a strong message"" with the rent control approval.""The city of Boston needs the tools to address our housing crisis,"" Wu said. ""We hear from residents across every single neighborhood just how dire it is and we see families who are getting pushed out of the communities that they grew up in and helped to build. This is affecting everything from how our businesses and economy can recover to our school enrollment and the stability of every part of our neighborhoods.""The topic of rent control was controversial even before the city began discussing Wu’s proposal in earnest. The mayor is seeking to usurp a 1990s statewide ban on the policy and restore a local form of rent control in Boston. Even though a recent poll suggests the policy is popular among likely voters statewide, the Massachusetts Legislature has shown little appetite for taking up the issue. ""The goal, as always, is to be in a conversation with our city government, with our residents, with our state government,"" Wu said when asked about the measure's likelihood of success on Beacon Hill. ""We all represent the same constituents, we all hear from the same families who are struggling to hang on in the city. ... I think we all share an urgency in knowing that this can't stand for Boston.""Wu has largely been alone as a city executive championing the issue. Mayors from several of Massachusetts' largest cities, including Cambridge, Fall River and Lynn, have indicated they have no plans to pursue their own rent control proposals. So far, only the city of Somerville, which previously had a rent control policy, has begun exploring a local option.Somerville City Council President Ben Ewen-Campen said the city's proposal is in its early stages, but they hope to present a finalized version for approval on Beacon Hill this fall. He noted that Somerville has previously sought — and failed — to bring back rent control. But he is more hopeful this time around.""I think we're at a really important point where we have a governor who has indicated that she is supportive of municipalities taking this step,"" Ewen-Campen said.He said he considers rent control a reasonable approach to help working class people live in the city.""The extreme position is what we have now,"" he explained, ""where some real estate investor or some LLC can buy up an apartment building and jack up the rent 30%, 40%, 100% and just evict people who have been in Somerville for years and have kids in the schools.""In Boston, Wu’s rent control proposal has upset both those with interests in the real estate sector and progressive housing advocates. The MassLandlords trade group and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board have publicly lobbied against Wu’s proposal, arguing that it would stifle housing production and worsen the city’s housing crisis. MassLandlords also argued Wu’s proposal, which exempts owners who live with their tenants and own six units or less, leaves out landlords who don’t live with their tenants, but still reside within the city of Boston. Councilor Michael Flaherty proposed an ultimately unsuccessful amendment to address that concern. Multiple councilors spoke against it, arguing that there’s a distinction between landlords who live with their renters and those who own investment properties.Meanwhile, housing advocates wanted to tighten portions of Wu’s plan by lowering the annual increase beyond 10% in high inflation years, or the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years.Wu’s proposal exempts college-operated dormitories and residential buildings for 15 years beginning from the date of their certificate of occupancy. It would also establish eviction protections and bar a landlord from recovering possession of a unit unless a housing court approves. Wu’s agency restructure plan would, if approved by the Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey, formally dissolve the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the official entity created in 1957 to oversee the city’s development activities in the era of urban renewal. The measure would codify a focus on three key planning principles — resilience, affordability and equity — and would also dissolve the partner Economic Development Industrial Corporation, established in 1971 to lead local economic development activities.Wu said Wednesday she expects ""strong"" support for the measure at the State House.The BRA began doing business as the Boston Planning and Development Agency in 2016 when then-Mayor Marty Walsh made a $600,000 bid to rebrand the agency to shed its reputation as inefficient and overly responsive to the desires of developers. Wu’s proposal would maintain the rebranded name.Councilors approved one amendment to Wu’s plan that maintains urban renewal land disposition agreements, area-specific restrictions that spell out what can and cannot be built in a given place.

Now, he said, is the time for the wealthy to ""pay their fair share"" in taxes.","PHILADELPHIA — President Joe Biden delivered an unapologetically economic populist message Saturday during the first rally of his reelection campaign, telling an exuberant crowd of union members that his policies had created jobs and lifted the middle class. Now, he said, is the time for the wealthy to ""pay their fair share"" in taxes.Biden spotlighted the sweeping climate, tax and health care package signed into law last year that cut the cost of prescription drugs and lowered insurance premiums — pocketbook issues that advisers say will be the centerpiece of his argument for a second term.""I'm looking forward to this campaign,"" Biden said to cries of ""four more years!"" before adding, ""We've got a record to run on.""His choice of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania — and a friendly union audience — as his first official campaign stop reflected their crucial role in his reelection effort. The city was the site of his 2020 campaign headquarters and the state was one of a handful that had voted for Republican Donald Trump in 2016 but flipped back to Democrats four years later.Until the rally, Biden's primary reelection campaign activity had been fundraising as the campaign tries to amass an impressive fundraising haul before the year's second quarter concludes at the end of the month. The president raised money at a private home in Greenwich, Connecticut, on Friday and soon will hold fundraisers in California, Maryland, Illinois and New York.More than 1,000 union workers representing professions from carpenters and airport service workers to entertainers and heavy service equipment engineers — most wearing T-shirts bearing their union's logos — began chanting ""Let's go, Joe!"" and ""We want Joe"" and blowing whistles hours before the president arrived.Biden did not mention any of his potential Republican opponents by name, but said many in the GOP ""oppose everything I've done."" Pointing to high inflation rates, Republicans have criticized ""Biden-omics"" a term the president tried to turn back his opponents on Saturday.""I don't know what the hell that is,"" he said, ""but it's working.""The event, which organizers said included unions representing 18 million workers nationwide, recalled then-candidate Biden opening his 2020 presidential campaign at a union hall in Pittsburgh.Several of the nation's most powerful unions — including the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — officially endorsed Biden's campaign on Friday. The first-of-its-kind joint endorsement among the unions, and the backdrop of hundreds of workers are part of a meticulously choreographed effort to show the support of labor behind what Biden himself calls the most pro-union president in history.The union endorsements followed Wednesday's joint endorsement from major environmental groups, a back-to-back backing by design, according to a campaign official, meant to demonstrate that tackling climate change through green jobs does not threaten workers' rights.Biden claimed in his remarks that if Wall Street bankers went on strike, no one would notice. But if unions members walked off the job, ""the whole country would come to a grinding halt."" He also criticized those worth more than $1 billion for paying, he said, as little as 8% in federal taxes.That prompted a man in the audience to shout, ""What do you pay?"" to which Biden responded, ""I pay a hell of a lot more than that."" He said repeatedly that the wealthy must ""pay their fair share.""Before addressing the union gathering, Biden took a helicopter tour over the collapsed section of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia that has complicated traffic along one of the nation's most crowded highways.Michael Smith, a 62-year-old retired electrician and is a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said he liked Biden's chances next year because of his administration's championing green jobs and construction.Jennifer McKinnon, 53, a grade school librarian and member of the National Education Association, said she felt that Biden had a personal commitment to education because his wife, Jill, was a teacher who continued to teach English at a Northern Virginia community college as first lady. Jill Biden, an NEA member, addressed the union rally, too.""I fear that the Republicans are going to get caught in their cycle that they did last time and people aren't going to buy it this time, so Joe's going to sweep right in,"" McKinnon said of the 2024 election, alluding to Trump, the early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Biden said his economic policies can lift all Americans regardless of economic status, an argument that could help him counter the kind of economic populism that buoyed Trump with some rank-and-file union members during his first two presidential campaigns.Clark Hamilton, a 63-year-old retiree and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers member, said Biden embraced union values but also noted that the president sometimes ""plays it like most politicians, in the middle."" He referenced Biden's urging Congress to helped prevent a rail strike last year, which the president said could cripple commerce nationwide.""That's a shame,"" Hamilton said. ""But he was trying to save the economy.""Still, Hamilton said he's confident that Biden's record will secure him a second term next year ""especially if it's against Trump.""

1198,"Underground Railroad simulation leaves former students frightened years later, new reporting finds",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/15/underground-railroad-simulation-leaves-former-students-frightened-years-later-new-reporting-finds,"Now adults, children who went through the ""haunting"" and ""scary"" curriculum from Massachusetts’ Nature’s Classroom are speaking up.","Since 1973, the Charlton-based Nature's Classroom Inc. has operated nationwide educational programs for elementary and middle schoolers, featuring a variety of overnight and daylong field trips at its outdoor facilities. Among the hundreds of programs available for teachers to choose from, one in particular has been the subject of intense scrutiny: The Underground Railroad Simulation. Over the years, many former students have come forward to share traumatic experiences endured during the program, which featured simulations of slave ships, slave auctions and bounty hunts with adults performing in character as slave masters. While the program was ended at the Charlton location in 2014, concerned parents have spoken out about the Underground Railroad Simulation being offered at other Nature's Classroom locations across the country. Irene Rotondo, a reporter with MassLive who's been covering the story, spoke with GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: So, before we get into talking about the Underground Railroad Simulation, tell us a bit more about Nature's Classroom. Who exactly are they and what do they do? Irene Rotondo: Nature's Classroom is an organization that started in 1973. It began as a nonprofit host site for other programs, such as the YMCA or similar organizations. It developed into a for-profit environmental educational site, and they do currently serve third through eighth grade. The thing about Nature's Classroom is, when the founder started it, they gave their blessing to use its curriculum — its hundreds of programs — in any state that wishes to have environmental education. So with that, there's no telling how many teachers' classrooms there are across the country — or how many programs — use Nature's Classroom curriculum and go by a different name. It's very difficult to tell. Rath: It has what seems like laudable aims, and what I guess would be a laudable aim with the Underground Railroad Simulation is that to give young people an idea of what slavery was like. But even just laying this out: you have a situation where these actors, or instructors, will play the role of slave masters, and the kids will play the role of slaves. It sounds like not a great idea, but tell us about what that actually played out for these kids, who describe this as traumatic. Rotondo: Before I get into that, I do want to just stress: Nature's Classroom is not a historical education site. Its original intent and intent to this day, as I was told by its director, is environmental education. The Underground Railroad program is one of its few historical programs. The people I spoke with who experienced it told me it was really haunting, horrifying and scary and just frightening for them to experience as young children. I spoke with two women, one was 25 years old and one was 22. They both experienced it around the same time, 2009 or 2010-ish. So they told me that during the program they were first led into a large cabin at night. It was part of an evening activity they had been told they'd be participating in. The children were all led into a large cabin that was only lit by candles and lanterns, they had said, to simulate them being inside a ""slave ship."" Once inside the ""slave ship,"" the children were told they were being taken to America. The children were laying on the floor, and as the children laid on the floor, they heard chains being slammed on the ground. Chains were being swung around the room, and the adults were yelling at the children, as transatlantic slave traders would. Through my reporting, I also saw a lot of TikToks about this and a lot of videos online. There's a lot of different accounts of what happened. It varied according to the Nature's Classroom institute the child went to. Not all the programs had the same intensity, but for the ones that did have the severe intensity, it really stuck with them. Other people recall a racial slur being used during this time, directed at the children by the instructors. After the children had ""arrived in America"" on the ""slave ship,"" they were led outside to be auctioned into smaller groups, basically to be broken up, to be led through the forest on the Underground Railroad expedition, which was the whole point of the activity, was to walk through the forest at night, guided by the counselors, and to learn about the history. What the former students told me happened is they were screamed at. Some remember dogs barking and dogs present on the premise. I was told in my interviews with the Nature's Classroom associate director that dogs weren't allowed on the premise at this time, there was no way they were dogs. But I will say, during my visit, there were dog tracks that I had seen on the premise. So people, the children, remember the dogs barking as they're being led through the woods. They remember other counselors pretending to be bounty hunters and slave owners popping out of the shadows, yelling at them. After that, they told me the activity ends in another cabin and they'd essentially arrived in Canada. They'd escaped the plantation, they'd escaped on the Underground Railroad, and they were now safe in Canada. But they had to then hide in different parts of that building from bounty hunters.That's pretty much where the activity ended. The whole goal of it, again, was just to teach the children about the Underground Railroad. The intensity that it was brought really, really stuck with a lot of people. And it changed a lot of their perspectives, too, especially for the Black children who had to experience this. I believe the perspectives were different. Race was another important part of this. Rath: Now, that was something that was flooring in reading your report was that a good number of these kids who were being treated as slaves in the psychodrama were people of color, Black kids themselves.Rotondo: Yeah, that was something that was really painful for for me to report on when I did hear the story, because it's hard to imagine having one Black child in the room full of white children and having to go through the experience and being told these things and being told to act as a slave, as a Black child. That was tough. Rath: What's the status of the Underground Railroad Simulation now? It's no longer being done in Massachusetts, right? Rotondo: I can say it is not being done at the Charlton location in Massachusetts. However, for the rest of the country, I cannot say the same. I know in 2018 there were more allegations that were brought up. And then, through my own reporting, I found listed on a Catholic organization — the Trinity Center's Sound to Sea Environmental Program, offered in North Carolina. They offer an education programs to children and to schools, to groups, listed on its site, that they used a lot of as classroom curricula. And it also says that the Underground Railroad program is being offered for the 2022-2023 year of service. So I know for sure it's being there. They didn't respond when I reached out to comment. I have also seen it listed on an FFA site in Ohio that also uses Nature's Classroom programing. I have seen it listed on an Alabama Nature's Classroom website. I have at least found for sure at least one, if not three to four, still presently — and that's just the ones that I know of. Rath: Wow. There is no clean ending to this story.Rotondo: No, unfortunately, no.",Local,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 18:33:52 EST",da971238bef15edde6e6ca61df2b4ca8
2399,Outspoken activists are using an old playbook to challenge Massachusetts libraries,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/31/outspoken-activists-are-using-an-old-playbook-to-challenge-massachusetts-libraries,Librarians and lawmakers say democracy and free speech are at stake.,"The number of book challenges and complaints have reached record levels nationwide, including here in Massachusetts.According to the American Library Association, Massachusetts saw 45 attempts to censor books and other library resources in 2022 — the fourth highest number of any state. That number is even higher, according to the Massachusetts Library Association's own survey, which reported 78 formal and informal challenges to books and programming last year. The surge in attempts to restrict access to library materials has alarmed free speech advocates, led to new legislation at the State House, and brought renewed attention to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling about censorship in schools.The towns of Dighton, Ludlow and Sturbridge have all been on the receiving end. Most of those attempts were to censor materials or library programming about race and sexuality — the same topics that vocal conservative groups have for years sought to limit.Discussions bubbled up in Dighton after the public library promoted ""Seeing Gender,"" a book about gender identity and expression. Community members met with library officials and also lined up at a board of trustees meeting to argue that ""sexual"" and ""politically inflammatory"" books should be separated from where children may see them. In Ludlow, a controversial proposal to alter the types of books and media allowed in school libraries, and to shift decision-making away from librarians and to the school committee, generated significant debate before the town's school committee ultimately voted against it last month. During a school committee meeting in May, Ludlow parent Bella Soares spoke in favor of the proposed policy change and pushed back against criticism that removing books would discriminate against students who identify as LGBTQ+.“Get this all through your heads,"" Soares said. ""You guys are the ones that are making it [about] LGBTQ. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with pornographic books in our school — drugs, rape, obscenity books. That's what we're trying to eliminate here.”And in Sturbridge, frustration over a public library-hosted event with a drag queen prompted critics to ask the Town Meeting to defund the library.James Lonergan, director of the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, said it’s a difficult time for library staff. He’s had library directors call him in tears from harassment.“They're trying to do good work. They're public servants. And frankly, they're being called names, or their ethics are being questioned,” Lonergan said.Ruth Bourquin, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the issue over what’s appropriate for school content is coming from a small number of conservative groups that describe themselves as defending parental rights and protecting children.“There's an uptick because there's a very well organized minority of people who seem to think they have nothing better to do with their lives but to try to control what other people's children can read in school libraries,” Bourquin said.Bourquin said all the arguments about free speech and parental control being used today hearken back to a decades-old U.S. Supreme Court case.In that 1982 decision, Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District v. Pico, the high court held that the First Amendment limits the power of school libraries to remove books because of their content. It was the first time — and still the only time — the Supreme Court heard a case about censorship in school libraries.For Steven Pico, the lead plaintiff in the case, today’s efforts to ban books are eerily similar to those he experienced over 40 years ago.""They call the case the 'Pico' case, which is very interesting, which is why I take it very personally,"" Pico told GBH News.The case originated in 1977, when he was a 17-year-old high school student in Levittown, New York. A parent's group had complained about 11 books in the school district's libraries, including Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” and Langston Hughes’s “Best Short Stories by Negro Writers.” The school board then removed the contested books from library shelves, calling them “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic and just plain filthy.” Pico joined with four other students to challenge the school board’s decision. He said it was his patriotic duty.“This is a democracy, and we have majoritarian rights,” Pico said, reflecting on his decision decades ago. “And we've come to a point in our country where people think and feel that they can make decisions for everybody else, like removing a book.”Andrea Fiorillo, co-chair of the Massachusetts Library Association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom Social Responsibility Committee, said most people are against censorship, but they need to make their voices heard as much as those pushing for it.“We are at an inflection point in our democracy where democratic norms and freedoms are being challenged,” said Fiorillo. On June 30, state Sen. Julian Cyr filed an act regarding free expression that bolsters existing state laws. Cyr said the legislation would prevent book removal, media and materials due to personal or political views in both public and school libraries, and protect librarians from retaliation. The Massachusetts House has also advanced a similar bill, An Act Ensuring Freedom to Read in the Commonwealth.""We must continue to champion our values of equity and belonging, that we cannot allow small-minded bans or politically opportunistic censorship to interfere with the right to read,” Cyr said.The ACLU of Massachusetts has also sent a letter to the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents and the Massachusetts Association of School Committees highlighting their legal obligations when it comes to books challenges. Bourquin said she doesn’t believe most schools are caving to book challenges, but instead follow a thoughtful review process that usually results in retaining the materials in question.And on the national level, Pico continues to push for freedom of speech and expression.“It seems like history is repeating itself on steroids,” Pico said. “And that is what's happening. But I'm optimistic, and I'll tell you why: because young people out there are listening now. They're aware that they have rights and there are things that they can do to combat censorship.”",Local,"Mon, 31 Jul 2023 05:00:47 EST",2e71beb62514cb30543c244aec559b5e
3543,"Former Holyoke Soldiers’ Home leaders can be prosecuted for COVID deaths, SJC rules",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/27/former-holyoke-soldiers-home-leaders-can-be-prosecuted-for-covid-deaths-sjc-rules,"AG Campbell’s office said the decision returns the case to Hampden Superior Court, where they face criminal charges in the more than 70 deaths.","A criminal trial can proceed against two former Holyoke Soldiers' Home officials accused of negligence that led to the deaths of elderly veteran residents early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the state's highest court ruled Thursday.In a 5-2 decision that reversed a lower court's dismissal of grand jury indictments, the Supreme Judicial Court said prosecutors should have a chance to try their case against Bennett Walsh, the facility's former superintendent, and David Clinton, its former medical director.The five-justice majority concluded that there is probable cause to believe Walsh and Clinton both qualified as ""caretakers"" for the veterans who lived in the state-run facility, and that their decision-making weeks into the public health emergency — particularly a move to combine symptomatic and asymptomatic veterans in a single, undersized unit — ""wantonly or recklessly"" exposed victims to the highly infectious virus.Superior Court Judge Edward McDonough ""erred in dismissing the indictments"" in November 2021, the high court said.""Of course, sometimes bad things happen for no discernable reason, and no one is to blame. At any subsequent trial, prosecutors will need to prove their case,"" Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt wrote in the majority ruling. ""We conclude only that they will have the opportunity to do so.""The case against Walsh and Clinton is based largely on a March 27, 2020 decision they allegedly made to combine 42 residents from two dementia units into a single unit that typically held 25 beds. Some of the veterans were symptomatic for COVID-19, and some were asymptomatic.Justices said that move ""produced a more considerable chance or probability"" of contracting COVID-19, even though Walsh and Clinton had argued the floors they were combining were self-contained and that the residents had already been exposed to the virus.Wendlandt's majority ruling quoted grand jury testimony from a state epidemiologist, who said guidance had been calling for separating patients who had tested positive and those who were asymptomatic as early as March 4, 2020 — more than three weeks before the consolidation.""In fact, Clinton apparently recognized the significance of the exposure risk, exercising particular caution with respect to himself and the doctors at the Soldiers' Home; on the same day that [a veteran] tested positive for COVID-19, Clinton began quarantining at home for a week because he was in a high-risk population — like the veterans in his care — and he advised other doctors to minimize their time at the Soldier's Home as well,"" Wendlandt wrote. ""Yet the grand jury heard testimony indicating that, despite protecting himself and fellow doctors against the risk of exposure, Clinton did not employ the same caution towards the veterans.""Justices David Lowy and Elspeth Cypher dissented. Lowy penned a 14-page dissent, attached to the opinion, arguing that Walsh and Clinton did their best to manage the risks of a nascent public health crisis amid staffing shortages.Lowy wrote that he and Cypher did not believe there was the necessary evidence to determine the defendants acted ""wantonly or recklessly.""""At its core, this prosecution is nothing more than an exercise in assigning blame with the benefit of hindsight,"" Lowy wrote. ""A finding of probable cause that the defendants acted wantonly or recklessly in this case ignores the chaos, uncertainty, and unknowns present during the earliest days of the pandemic. Such a finding also fails to recognize the untenable staffing challenges the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke (Soldiers' Home) faced during this time.""""There can be no doubt that what occurred at the Soldiers' Home in March 2020 was a tragedy,"" Lowy added. ""And in the face of such tragedy, perhaps hurling blame and subjecting the defendants to imprisonment might salve our conscience. But criminalizing blame will do nothing to prevent further tragedy or help unravel the complex reasons why the responses of the Soldiers' Home and so many nursing homes proved inadequate in the nascent days of the pandemic.""The landmark opinion is poised to revive the spotlight on one of the most high-profile individual crises of the public health emergency. At least 76 military veterans who lived in the Holyoke long-term care facility died of COVID-19, prompting a flurry of investigations, terminations and resignations, regulatory reforms and lawsuits.Former Attorney General Maura Healey, who is now governor, announced the charges against Walsh and Clinton in September 2020, alleging that they made a series of decisions that ran counter to common infection control protocols and exacerbated COVID-19's toll inside the home.Healey called it ""the first criminal case in the country brought against those involved in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic."" At least one other similar case has since been filed: in March, Los Angeles prosecutors filed charges against operators of a facility related to 14 deaths early in the pandemic.A spokesperson for Healey, who appealed the Superior Court dismissal of the indictments, did not comment Thursday.Healey's successor, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, praised the ruling.""The Court's decision today is welcome and important news, and it affirms what we already knew: the leaders and managers of facilities like the Soldiers' Home share responsibility for the health and safety of their residents,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""Today's decision allows us to focus once again on securing accountability for the tragic and preventable deaths at the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke.""Campbell's office said the decision returns the case to Hampden Superior Court, where Walsh and Clinton will each face five counts of caretaker who wantonly or recklessly commits or permits abuse, neglect or mistreatment to an elder or disabled person.Michael Jennings, an attorney who represented Walsh, said it is ""important to remember that this decision is very limited.""""It only involves the question of whether the grand jury heard enough evidence to support probable cause to 'arrest' or in this case to accuse by indictment. The grand jury process is a closed, one sided process,"" Jennings said in a statement to the News Service. ""The subject and/or counsel are not present. No cross examination of witnesses. Hearsay is admissible and much of this presentation was based on hearsay. No opportunity for the subject of the grand jury inquiry to present contrary evidence. And there is plenty of it. The court found that there was enough evidence presented to the grand jury to support a finding of probable cause.""He pointed to footnotes in the majority ruling in which justices emphasize that the question they sought to answer was not whether the defendants ""did the best they could,"" and to another footnote in the dissent in which Lowy wrote that Walsh was primarily an administrator who relied on medical professionals to make the decision to consolidate patients.""We've been preparing for trial. We'll be ready to challenge the Commonwealth's evidence in a public courtroom in front of a jury when that opportunity comes,"" Jennings added.Said Jeffrey Pyle, an attorney for Clinton: ""The dissent eloquently explains why this prosecution is misguided, and why Dr. Clinton is not guilty. We look forward to clearing his name at trial.""",Local,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:27:11 EST",a25aa7b96451df7ae53a01f8869e84ee
6028,Boston's own 'Guster' to perform with Keith Lockhart and Boston Pops,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/06/06/bostons-own-guster-to-perform-with-keith-lockhart-and-boston-pops,The indie-rock band with a cult following has been going strong for more than 30 years.,"An indie-rock band with a local cult following was born in a dorm room at Tufts University 32 years ago — and this week, they’ll be melding their sound with the Boston Pops. Boston’s own Guster joined Boston Public Radio Tuesday ahead of their sold-out shows at Boston Symphony Hall with conductor Keith Lockhart, who they’ve performed with a number of times over the last two decades. “He [Keith] was the young conductor at the time, coming into this — this was 18 years ago — and was realizing, ‘Hey, we need to bring youth into the Symphony. Let’s partner with a Boston band that can bring young people’ — meaning, like, 40-year-olds,” said Adam Gardner, the band’s guitarist. “This was our first-ever orchestra show, 18 years ago,” frontman Ryan Miller chimed in, estimating that the band had performed with the Pops about a dozen times. “And then Keith walked in yesterday. I don’t know if he said this, but in my mind, he was like, ‘Oh, time is a cruel mistress.’ He looked at us and his own life flashed before his eyes.”The band members also took the time to address their friendship and fans. “We’ve been having a blast for 30 years now — and if we weren’t, we probably wouldn’t be doing this,” drummer Brian Rosenworcel said. “We keep the relationships strong. If you’re communicating and your friendships are strong, you’re gonna want to make music together.”“A lot of it, too is just having people that continue to show up to support the band,” Miller added. “Part of it for us, I think, is the amazement that every time we can put up a Tanglewood or a Pops or do three days at a festival that there could be 3, 4, 5,000 people that show up, that still cares about our music. We feel like we have to take this very seriously, keep trying really hard, to challenge ourselves, and really honor our relationships — and just try and make good stuff so they’re not embarrassed to wear their Guster T-shirts.”Tickets go on sale June 12 for Guster’s performance at the BSO’s Tanglewood. Later this summer, the band will headline its third annual On the Ocean festival in Portland, Maine, August 11-13.",Local,"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 18:13:51 EST",b2e5c5a162ce5a246e07ac73c92ecd02
7416,'Barbie' is the only billion-dollar blockbuster solely directed by a woman,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/08/barbie-is-the-only-billion-dollar-blockbuster-solely-directed-by-a-woman,"Barbie will surpass $1 billion worldwide, according to Warner Bros. estimates. Hard as it may be to believe, that makes director Greta Gerwig the only woman in the billion-dollar club with sole credit for directing a film.","Barbie will surpass $1 billion worldwide, according to Warner Bros. estimates. Hard as it may be to believe, that makes director Greta Gerwig the only woman in the billion-dollar club with sole credit for directing a film.A couple of other women have shared credit for directing movies that made more than a billion dollars. Both Frozen and Frozen II were co-directed by a man and a woman, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck. And Anna Boden co-directed Captain Marvel with Ryan Fleck. Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, is among the top 60 highest grossing films, not adjusted for inflation, but it has not broken the billion dollar barrier.Most of the movies in the billion dollar club are, predictably, male-oriented and franchise-driven. At this moment, 53 films have made more than a billion dollars. Barbie is among only nine that center female protagonists. Nine, that is, if you count female fish. Finding Dory (2016) swims in the billion dollar club, along with the animated princesses of Frozen (2013), Frozen II (2019) and Beauty and the Beast (2017). Two mega-franchises managed to spit out a billion-dollar film with women at the story's heart: Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) and Captain Marvel (2019). Then, two other billion dollar one-offs: Titanic (1997) and a live-action Alice in Wonderland (2010). In short, plots centering women and girls currently make up 18% of all billion-dollar movies. Nearly half of them are animated films made for children. Blockbusters with strong girl characters are great. But the dearth of super successful movies about grown women illustrates Hollywood's infamous sluggishness when it comes to gender parity.""[This] is a reflection of what Hollywood has chosen to back with its biggest budgets, its largest marketing spends, and who it has ... given the opportunity to direct and write and star in these movies,"" The Hollywood Reporter's senior film editor, Rebecca Keegan, pointed out on a recent episode of the podcast The Town. ""So it's a little hard to say that that's responding to market forces versus that is a reflection of the culture that's driven Hollywood for decades.""The Town's host, Matthew Belloni, pointed out that on Barbie's opening weekend, women made up 69% of ticket buyers domestically. ""And then it actually rose to 71% female in the second weekend, which is unusual,"" he said. Anecdotally, it seems numerous women return to the movie, bringing relatives and friends. And Barbie's crossover appeal to men cannot be denied. Stacey L. Smith of the University of Southern California has long studied inclusion in popular culture. Her most recent report, from February, shows that female representation in television and film has steadily improved. Her study looks at the top 1,600 movies in a given year. In 2007, the percentage of female protagonists was only 20%. In 2022, that number had risen to 44%. Not perfect.

4375,Malfunction of firefighting equipment slowed Red Line fire response,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/14/malfunction-of-firefighting-equipment-slowed-red-line-fire-response,"The MBTA, which is responsible for maintaining the ""standpipe,"" says it was up to date on inspections.","When Boston firefighters responded to a fire on a Red Line train at the Charles/MGH station Thursday morning, they did what they normally would do. They connected a hose to a nearby fire hydrant and used one of their trucks to pump water into what is known as a standpipe. That pipe is supposed to carry the water to upper floors where firefighters could access it without having to deploy hundreds of feet of hose. But as Boston Fire Department spokesman Brian Alkins told GBH News, “As they waited for the water, they realized they weren't getting the water, or they might have gotten only some of the water. It wasn’t enough pressure in the water because of the crack or the malfunction of the pipe.”So, instead of being carried up to the second floor where the smoking train was, the water leaked out and flooded the first floor. That’s when firefighters grabbed extinguishers and cans of water to carry them upstairs to fight the fire. “It slowed us down a little bit because obviously we were expecting the water to come out of there, but it didn't deter us from putting the fire out,” Atkins said. Fortunately, the fire was mostly a smoky affair and was quickly extinguished once firefighters arrived. The T said that an AC condenser underneath a Red Line car malfunctioned and overheated. All passengers were able to evacuate safely without injury. But the incident disrupted the morning commute for two hours until the train was removed. It’s the latest safety problem — even the latest fire — to plague the T, with a metal box falling on a woman standing on the Harvard station platform earlier this year and a rider who was dragged to his death last spring. Milosh T. Puchovsky, a professor in the department of fire protection engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, told GBH News that frequent inspections are essential. “Once they're put in, they often sit idle,” he said. “But when you need them, then they need to work.”When asked about the problem with the malfunctioning standpipe — which the MBTA is responsible for maintaining — spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said that the agency had complied with national guidelines that say standpipes should be checked every five years. “The standpipe at Charles/MGH was successfully tested and inspected in 2019,” Pesaturo said. “It’s not clear at this time what caused the problem yesterday.” Pesaturo added the T’s investigation into the standpipe will continue. Puchovsky said that changes could have happened between 2019 and now that would have impacted the standpipe. “It may have been tested five years ago, but I don't know if any work had been done on the system that could have affected it in some way,” he said. Standpipes are often required by local fire codes or building codes for certain types of high-rise buildings, large structures or transportation hubs. The type of standpipe that Puchovsky believes this was — a “dry manual” standpipe — isn’t always filled with water. That type of standpipe can make it harder to detect cracks. “That’s why there there’s a pretty rigorous inspection testing and maintenance protocol,” Puchovsky said.",Local,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 16:20:14 EST",d07756f993812681eef109b27cd7281d
218,Boston unveils logo for 2026 World Cup,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/18/boston-unveils-logo-for-2026-world-cup,Schedule for games expected to be unveiled later this year.,"The 2026 men's World Cup is three years away, but Patriots owner Robert Kraft is already in a full-on soccer fever. “I go back to [the 1994 men’s World Cup] and the world we’re living in now, we need the World Cup more than ever,” said Kraft, who was the honorary chairman of the World Cup United bid between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Kraft will get a chance to see the impact the World Cup will have on the world when Gillette Stadium hosts games in 2026. And on Thursday, for the first time, Boston unveiled its official branding for the 2026 World Cup as it continues to prepare to take part in one of the world’s biggest sporting events. Local and state officials were on hand at Big Night Live on Causeway Street for the unveil party. Speaking at the event, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu pointed to the city's international spirit.""So it only makes sense that for the fourth time, the world's game will return to the city of the world,” she said. “We've opened our doors to our neighbors across the globe for more than 400 years here in Boston. And we can't wait to do it again in 2026 for fan fests, celebrations and viewings throughout our neighborhoods. We can't wait to welcome you to our incredible city.""There’s no word yet on how many games Gillette Stadium will host; the schedule for 2026 is expected to be released later this year. Boston will know which teams will play at Gillette at the final draw, which is set to take place a few months before the Cup. Regardless who ends up playing here, the impact the World Cup will have on the area is expected to be massive. Organizers say an economic impact of up to $500 million could be coming Boston’s way from the games at Gillette Stadium. Brian Bilello, president of the New England Revolution, said that each host city will get six and a half matches on average — but he’s hoping for more. He pointed out that the Boston area has several communities that would come out to support the countries that could end up playing at Gillette. ""For me, the U.S. would be great. I mean, to have the home team here, there's nothing like it,"" Bilello said. ""We have a great Brazilian population, we've had some amazing events with Brazil at our stadium in the past. My family's all Italian, so for me, I would love to see Italy. But we have a vibrant Colombian community, we have a vibrant Haitian community if Haiti qualifies. ... You name the country, and we have a great community to support it here in Boston.""",Local,"Thu, 18 May 2023 17:58:36 EST",81e95a24e25b5fc6c52fb54fa29e7fee
186,Movie extras worry they'll be replaced by AI. Hollywood is already doing body scans,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/08/02/movie-extras-worry-theyll-be-replaced-by-ai-hollywood-is-already-doing-body-scans,"After four weeks of working as a background actor on the Disney+ series WandaVision during the pandemic, Alexandria Rubalcaba was told by the production crew to report to a tractor trailer.","After four weeks of working as a background actor on the Disney+ series WandaVision during the pandemic, Alexandria Rubalcaba was told by the production crew to report to a tractor trailer. Dozens of other background actors were wrangled to the same site, where, one by one, they were told to step in front of a series of cameras on metal rigs behind glass. ""Have your hands out. Have your hands in. Look this way. Look that way. Let us see your scared face. Let us see your surprised face,"" Rubalcaba, 47, recalls of the instructions she was given. Rubalcaba said the actors had their faces and bodies scanned for about 15 minutes each. Then their digital replicas were created. But here's the rub: She was never told how or if this digital avatar of herself would ever be used on screen. If it's used, she might never know. No matter what happens with it, she'll never see any payment for it.Disney did not return a request for comment. Rubalcaba, who makes the SAG-AFTRA union rate of $187 a day as a background actor, said she did not give permission for her digital replica to ever be used in the background of any scenes. ""What if I don't want to be on MarioVision, or SarahVision?"" she said, rattling off made-up future productions. ""I fear that AI is eventually going to weed out background actors. They won't have any use for us anymore."" The potential for artificial intelligence to replace background actors is one of the central tensions in the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike with studios, the biggest labor dispute in Hollywood since the 1960s. Background actors caught off guard by body scansBackground actors are not part of what's known as the ""principal cast,"" meaning they do not have speaking parts and primarily serve to create realistic atmosphere by filling out a scene. A union negotiator has claimed studios have offered to give background actors one day's pay after being scanned and that the actor's digital likeness could then be re-used ""for the rest of eternity."" The studios have strongly taken issue with this characterization, claiming a background actor's digital replica would only be used on projects the performer was hired for, not indefinite future productions.Either way, the practice of body-scanning background actors appears to be becoming more common. Five background actors interviewed by NPR all said they were caught off guard in recent months by having to undergo body scans by studios, feeling like they didn't have much of a choice, because if they pushed back, they feared the risk of retaliation. Most of the actors were were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. ""You don't know what's going to get back to casting. You don't know if they're going to call up casting and say, 'Oh this person is being difficult,' and not hire them again because that's how the system works,"" said Rebecca Safier, a background actor in Los Angeles who recently had her body scanned on set. ""It's getting into this gray area of, 'what are they going to use it for in the future?'"" An 'existential threat' to background actors Hollywood has long relied on high-tech tinkering to enhance films in post production. The producers of Games of Thrones and Lord of the Rings have fashioned large battle armies by relying on computer software that creates hordes of synthetic fighters.And now that tech giants are in the movie-making business, they are doing it, too. For instance, Apple filled a stadium with what looked like 26,000 people by using digital doubles of just 20 background actors.This method, known as ""crowd tiling"" is not new. For years, studios have used it shoot large group scenes. But now with the technology taking strides forward with the advent of generative AI — which can create new conversations, images and videos by synthesizing an immense corpus of data with souped up hardware capable of harnessing an incredible amount of computing power — it is not only crowd scenes that are being digitally created. There are AI-powered film editing tools that let film-makers move an actor's performance from one scene to another or replace dialogue. Other AI tools can make an actor's lips move as if they are speaking in an overdubbed language. Disney has an AI tool that can convincingly make an actor look younger or older in seconds. One of most controversial uses of AI in Hollywood is digital cloning. Voices, faces and entire bodies can now be digitally re-created in ways that appear stunningly realistic. Background actors in Hollywood say they worry they will be first in the industry made obsolete by AI.Andrew Susskind, a associate professor at Drexel University's film and TV department who spent 30 years as a producer and director, said the widespread use of digital extras could impact budgets in significant ways. ""Imagine ballroom scenes, party scenes, any scenes that need tons of extras,"" Susskind said. ""Imagine the amounts of money they would be saving. Not paying $180 a day. Plus meals. Plus costuming."" Because there presently are no rules of the road for how studios use AI, Susskind said it makes sense that actors, and writers have made AI a central sticking point in the Hollywood strikes. ""The actors, extras and the writers are right to see this moment as their best chance to set up what the rules should be in the use of AI,"" he said. ""And the people in the background, who tend to have no real power and are treated badly, should be standing up for themselves here."" Katrina Sherwood, who works as a stand-in, body-double and background actress in Los Angeles, said she is distressed that AI will one day force her into another industry altogether. ""Our likeness is really the only thing that we actually own, so, for background, that would be an existential threat,"" she said. About 84,200 of SAG-AFTRA's 160,000 active members have performed background work at some point in their career. Last year, more than 30,000 SAG members did at least one gig as a background actor. Unions and studios disagree over AI consent SAG-AFTRA is not resisting AI altogether. Union officials have said that a digital replica of an actor could allow for an actor to be at two shoots at once, or take on a project they would not have done otherwise. But union officials say they will only support a contract that ensures adequate compensation to actors for their likeness being used. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade group representing studios and producers, said they will offer ""fair compensation"" if an actor's digital replica is used. They say they will only use such AI creations after receiving permission from the actor. Yet both sides are at odds over the meaning of consent. Studios are proposing that they will ask for background actors' permission once — after they are hired. Union officials say any use of an actor's digital replica should be bargained separately each time the digital likeness is used. Dom Lubsey, a Los Angeles actor who does primarily background work, said unlike principal actors, extras do not have much say over how their performances are reused. ""I don't often hear people speaking up for background [actors], or if they're being abused, if they're not being treated properly, of if they should be paid more,"" he said. ""You just don't hear that."" He said it is something that goes through his head every time his face and body has been scanned on set. The first time it happened was on the set of a popular racing moving, in 2019. Mostly recently, he was scanned for a television program about basketball. ""They wanted me to do cheering. I had to make angry faces. They asked for a war-cry faces. I did it all,"" he said. After that, he felt a little rattled. He stepped out of the semi-truck trailer where a large cylinder outfitted with hundreds of small cameras had just scanned his various gestures as a game audience member. Perhaps the cost of doing business in Hollywood in the AI era, although is it also a step closer to his professional extinction, he wondered? ""My first thought leaving the trailer was, 'Oh this might just be the future,"" Lubsey said. ""We might just lose our jobs.""

""At which point there was a moment of stunned silence, to be brutally honest.""Erasmus decided to turn the light aircraft around and make an emergency landing at the closest airport of Welkom.""I then informed my passengers of what was going on... but everybody remained calm,"" he recounted.A Cape cobra bite can kill someone in as little as an hour.

6131,So your tween wants a smartphone? Read this first,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/12/so-your-tween-wants-a-smartphone-read-this-first,Your tween wants a smartphone very badly. So badly that it physically hurts. And they're giving you soooo many reasons why.,"Your tween wants a smartphone very badly. So badly that it physically hurts. And they're giving you soooo many reasons why. They're going to middle school ... they need it to collaborate with peers on school projects ... they need it to tell you where they are ... when they'll be home ... when the school bus is late. It'll help you, dear parent, they vow. Plus, all their friends have one, and they feel left out. Come on! Pleeeeeeze.Before you click ""place order"" on that smartphone, pause and consider a few insights from a person who makes a living helping parents and tweens navigate the murky waters of smartphones and social media.Emily Cherkin spent more than a decade as a middle school teacher during the early aughts. She watched first-hand as the presence of smartphones transformed life for middle schoolers. For the past four years, she's been working as screen-time consultant, coaching parents about digital technology. Her first piece of advice about when to give a child a smartphone and allow them to access social media was reiterated by other experts over and over again: Delay, delay, delay. 'I wish I knew then what I know now'""I have talked to hundreds of parents,"" Cherkin explains, ""and no one has ever said to me, 'I wish I gave my kid a phone earlier or I wish I'd given them social media access sooner. Never.""In fact, parents tell her the opposite. ""I always hear, 'I wish I had waited. I wish I knew then what I know now,' "" she says, ""because boy, once you give a child one of these devices or technologies, it is so much harder to take it back.""Smartphones, social media, and video games create large spikes in dopamine deep inside a child's brain. As NPR has reported, those spikes pull the child's attention to the device or app, almost like a magnet. They tell the child's brain that this activity is super critical – way more critical than other activities that trigger smaller spikes in dopamine, such as finishing homework, helping to clean up after dinner, or even playing outside with friends.Thus, parents set themselves up for a constant struggle when a child starts having their own smartphone, Cherkin says. ""It's the dopamine you're fighting. And that's not a fair fight. So I tell parents, 'Delay all of it just as long as you can,'"" she emphasizes.That means delaying, not just a smartphone, but any device, including tablets, she suggests. By introducing a tablet at an early age, even for educational purposes, parents can establish a habit that may be hard to break later, Cherkin has observed. ""A child using a tablet at age 6 to 8 comes to expect screen time after school,"" she says. ""Flash forward to age 12, and now they have a phone. And when they come home from school, they're likely engaging with social media, instead of educational videos."" Neurologically children's brains haven't developed enough to handle the magnetic pull of these devices and the apps on them, says neuroscientist Anne-Noël Samaha at the University of Montreal. ""It's almost as if you have the perfect storm,"" Samaha explains. ""You have games, social media, and even pornography and shopping online, and the brains of children are just not yet ready to have the level of self-control needed to regulate their behavior with these activities. Even adults sometimes don't have enough self-control to do that or handle some of the emotional impact of them.""Right-size your parenting fearsParents often feel like once their tween starts moving around more autonomously through their neighborhood or town more, the child needs a smartphone to be safe, Cherkin says. ""They may think, 'Oh, my gosh! My kid is going to be kidnapped on the way to school. They need a phone to call me.' But Cherkin notes that parents tend to overestimate the dangers of the ""real world."" and underestimate the dangers of a smartphone. ""I think our fears are very misplaced,"" she says. ""We need to think about what is statistically really likely to happen versus what's really, really unlikely.""Each year in the U.S. about a hundred children are abducted by strangers or people or slight acquaintances, the U.S. Department of Justice reported. Given that 50 million children, ages 6 to 17, reside in the U.S, the risk of a child being kidnapped by a stranger is about 0.0002% each year. (By comparison, the risk of being struck by lightning each year is about 0.0001%.) On the other hand, giving a child a phone comes with a whole new set of risks and dangers, Cherkin says. They can be difficult for some parents to understand because they may not have much first-hand experience with specific apps, and the new threats that are emerging. Back in March, the nonprofit Common Sense Media surveyed about 1,300 girls, ages 11 to 15, about their experiences on social media. Nearly 60% of the girls who use Instagram, and nearly 60% of those who use Snapchat, said they had been contacted by a stranger that makes them uncomfortable. The same was true for 46% of those who use TikTok. Disturbing online encounters and influencesThe same survey found that these apps often expose girls to content they find disturbing or harmful. For those that use Instagram, TikTok or Snapchat, 12% to 15% of girls see or hear content related to suicide, on a daily basis. About the same percentage also said they see or hear content about eating disorders, on a daily basis as well.An investigation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate also found evidence that content related to suicide and disordered eating is relatively common on TikTok. In the investigation, the nonprofit set up eight accounts ostensibly by 13-year-old children. Each user paused on and liked videos about body image and mental health. Within 30 minutes, TikTok recommended content about suicide and eating disorders to all eight accounts. In one instance, this content began appearing in less than three minutes. On average, TikTok suggested content about eating disorders every 4 minutes to the teen accounts.TikTok declined NPR's request for an interview, but in an email, a spokesperson for the company wrote: ""We're committed to building age-appropriate experiences, while equipping parents with tools, like Family Pairing, to support their teen's experience on TikTok."" Emma Lembke, age 20, says these findings line up with what she experienced when she first went on Instagram eight years ago. ""As a 12-year-old girl, I felt like I was being constantly bombarded by bodies that I could never replicate or ones that I could try to, but it would lead me in a darker direction.""She remembers just trying to look up a healthy recipe. ""And from that one search, I remember being fed constant stuff about my '200-calorie day' or intermittent fasting.""Eventually she says, her feed was ""covered with anorexic, thin, tiny women. Dieting pills, lollipops to suppress my appetite."" Lembke developed an eating disorder. She has recovered, and now is a digital advocate and founder of the Log OFF project, which helps teens build healthier relationships with social media. ""When I was younger, I was being prodded and poked and fed material [on social media] that was really leading me in a direction toward an eating disorder,"" she says. ""I think for a lot of young women, even if it doesn't materialize into a fully fledged eating disorder, it painfully warps their sense of self by harming their body image. ""Instagram's parent company, Meta, declined a request for an interview. But in an email, a spokesperson said the company has invested in technology that finds and removes content related to suicide, self-injury or eating disorders before anyone reports it. ""We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we're doing to provide teens with safe, supportive experiences online,"" they wrote. A whole world of sexually explicit contentMany children also come across sexualized content, even porn, on social media apps, Cherkin says. If you want to get a sense for what your kid might encounter once you let them have a phone and popular apps, Cherkin recommends trying this: Set up a test account in one of the apps, setting the age of the user to your child's age, and then use the account yourself for a few weeks. ""I did that with Snapchat. I set up an account, pretending to be 15. Then I just went to the Discover feed, where it pushes content to you based on your age,"" she explains. Within seconds, sexualized content and vulgar images appeared, she says. ""And I thought, 'No, this is not appropriate for a 15-year-old.""Snapchat's parent company, Snap, also declined a request for an interview with NPR. A spokesperson wrote in an email: ""We have largely kept misinformation, hate speech, and other potentially harmful content from spreading on Snapchat. That said, we completely understand concerns about the appropriateness of the content that may be featured, and are working to strengthen protections for teens with the aim of offering them a more age-appropriate experience."" Personally, Cherkin uses Instagram for her business. And back in March, despite all her knowledge about the traps on social media, she says she ""got catfished."" She engaged with a stranger who seemed to be a teen in her DMs, and eventually received obscene and disturbing photos of a man's genitalia. She writes on her blog: ""It's graphic. It's gross. And this is one teeny (lol) example of what kids and teens see ALL THE TIME."" What's a parent to do? Consider smartphone alternativesIn the end, Cherkin says, there are several other in-between options for tweens besides giving them their own smartphone or denying them a phone altogether. You can:Share your phone with your tween so they can text with and call friends. Give your tween a ""dumb phone"" that only allows texting and calling. For example, buy an old-school flip phone. But if that's out of the question because it's not cool enough (and you have extra cash to spare), you can now buy dumb phones that look like smartphones but have extremely limited functions – no easy-access to the internet, no social media. And very little risk of inappropriate content. Try to limit the apps your child uses – but get ready to be busy monitoring themIf you do end up getting your tween a smart phone, Cherkin says, you might be tempted to simply ""block"" children from downloading particular apps on their phones. And in theory, this works. Parental control apps, such as Bark, can notify you when an app is installed. But, she says, many kids find workarounds to this approach – and really any parental controls. For instance, she says, if you block Instagram on their phone, kids can login via the web. If you block TikTok, they might watch Tiktok videos in Pinterest. Kids can find porn on Spotify.""Kids are way tech savvier than we are,"" Cherkin wrote in an email. ""Remember how we used to program the VCR for our parents?! Every single parent who comes to me for help has a variation of this same story: 'We had X parental controls; we blocked X sites; our child figured out how to access them anyway.' ... It's impossible to successfully block everything — and once you do, a replacement will pop up in its place.""In other words, once you give your child a smartphone, you will likely be setting up yourself for a whole new series of parenting tasks and worries. Even Meta reveals this in its April ad for their parental controls: The mom in the ad is monitoring her son's Instagram account while doing the dishes.

4813,"Basic Black: The future of diversity, equity and inclusion",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/04/07/basic-black-the-future-of-diversity-equity-and-inclusion,The United State's racial reckoning led to an explosion in workplace diversity positions. Where are they now?,"The diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) industry saw unseen levels of investment in 2020 as companies examined their workplace cultures following the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent racial reckoning. Many companies drafted statements on their “commitment” to DEI, and some hired new officers to ensure the work would be done. DEI roles increased by 55% in 2020 alone, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.But three years later, that explosion in these positions hasn't led to significant change in corporate America. Guests on Basic Black said people still aren't grasping the goal of DEI, and some in positions of power view it as a threat.""The whole idea of the DEI role is disruptive. You're removing barriers. You're working in a system that is not set up for you. You're walking into dismantlement,"" said Kim Dukes, managing director at Koya Partners Diversified Search Group. Recent layoffs across the country have disproportionately affected DEI professionals. In 2022, the attrition rate for DEI roles was 33%, compared to 21% for non-DEI roles, according to an analysis by Revelio Labs. In addition, many employees who stepped into DEI roles have left due to frustration and burnout. Diversity officers in towns including Lowell, Natick, Falmouth, Pembrook and Worcester all stepped down over issues with lack of support, communication and microaggressions from coworkers. Dr. Anouska Bhattacharyya, vice president of programs at YW Boston, said companies should view the equity effort as an ongoing journey where mistakes will be made, but ultimately, it's a crucial piece of technology just like any operation system. ""It is really about breaking down the idea that DEI is this new limb, that you have to grow this new set of strategies, new language that we can weaponize against each other, that it makes people feel like they're excluded. It is about us feeling like we belong in any space,"" Bhattacharyya said.Felicia Jadczak, co-founder, co-CEO and head of DEI programming at SHE+ Geeks Out, likened DEI efforts to a pie where everyone gets a piece. However, people with a large part of the pie right now don't want to get a smaller piece.""That resistance is going to be very challenging to overcome, because it's not something you can overcome with a training, with reading a book, with listening to a podcast, with watching this discussion right here,"" Jadczak said. She noted that a long, sustained effort will be the best approach. Along with a long and sustained effort, Dr. Nefertiti Walker, vice chancellor for equity and inclusion at UMass Amherst, said it's important for leaders to set their own goals and priorities around DEI. ""The difference between the organizations who have been successful and progressing towards their DEI goals are the ones who have embedded DEI into the fabric of who they are and into the fabric of positions that they have in existence, and not made it something adjacent to leadership, adjacent to the organizational goals,"" Walker said.

""Same deal as I would with any artist i collab with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty. I have no label and no legal bindings,"" she added.Courts have not yet weighed in on AI's use in music and it's unclear how any profit would shake out legally. Grimes asked creators to register music with her website.Fans immediately posted links to songs they've created featuring her vocal likeness. The Canadian artist said she's looking forward to being a ""guinea pig"" for such projects.The musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer appears to have been inspired by last week's release of ""Heart on My Sleeve,"" a viral hit that cloned the voices of Drake and The Weeknd, but has since been removed from streaming and social media platforms after the record label claimed copyright violations.Neither Boucher or her team responded to NPR's questions about what she might do in cases where someone might make a song with objectionable, racist or violent lyrics. But she addressed the issue in a subsequent tweet, saying they ""may do copyright takedowns ONLY for rly rly toxic lyrics w grimes voice.""She pleaded with creators to not be ""the worst.""""That's the only rule,"" she wrote. ""Rly don't like to do a rule but don't wanna be responsible for a Nazi anthem unless it's somehow in jest a la producers I guess. - wud prefer avoiding political stuff but If it's a small meme with ur friends we prob won't penalize that. Probably just if smthn is viral and anti abortion or smthn like that.""She later said she wasn't even sure, however, if she could legally ask for songs to be taken down.This is not the first times Boucher has weighed in in support of AI-generated art or her first foray into AI song-making. In 2020 she worked with mood music start up Endel to launch an AI baby lullaby-making app. She told The New York Times she was inspired to create ""a better baby sleeping situation"" for son, X Æ A-XII Musk. His father is Elon Musk.""I think A.I. is great,"" she said in the interview. ""I just feel like, creatively, I think A.I. can replace humans.

Jean Carroll.,"NEW YORK (AP) — A jury found Donald Trump liable Tuesday for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million in a judgment that could haunt the former president as he campaigns to regain the White House.The verdict was announced in a federal courtroom in New York City on the first day of jury deliberations. Jurors rejected Carroll’s claims that she was raped, but found Trump liable for sexually abusing her.Hours earlier, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan read instructions on the law to the nine-person jury before the panel began discussing Carroll's allegations of battery and defamation shortly before noon.Trump, who did not attend the trial, has insisted he never sexually assaulted Carroll or even knew her.Kaplan told jurors that the first question on the verdict form was to decide whether they think there is more than a 50% chance that Trump raped Carroll inside a store dressing room. If they answered yes, they would then decide whether compensatory and punitive damages should be awarded.If they answered no on the rape question, they could then decide if Trump subjected her to lesser forms of assault involving sexual contact without her consent or forcible touching to degrade her or gratify his sexual desire. If they answered yes on either of those questions, they will decide if damages are appropriate.On defamation claims stemming from a statement Trump made on social media last October, Kaplan said jurors needed to be guided by a higher legal standard — clear and convincing evidence.He said they would have to agree it was “highly probable” that Trump's statement was false and was made maliciously with deliberate intent to injure or out of hatred or ill will with reckless disregard for Carroll's rights.Meanwhile, Trump posted a new message on social media, complaining that he is now awaiting the jury's decision “on a False Accusation.” He said he is “not allowed to speak or defend myself, even as hard nosed reporters scream questions about this case at me.”Trump said he will not speak until after the trial, “but will appeal the Unconstitutional silencing of me ... no matter the outcome!”Trump never attended the trial, which is in its third week, and rejected an invitation to testify, which the judge extended through the weekend even after Trump's attorney, Joe Tacopina, said Thursday that his client would not testify.Tacopina told the jury in closing arguments Monday that Carroll's account is too far fetched to be believed. He said she made it up to fuel sales of a 2019 memoir in which she first publicly revealed her claims and to disparage Trump for political reasons.Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, cited excerpts from Trump's October deposition and his notorious comments on a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which he said celebrities can grab women between the legs without asking.She urged jurors to believe her client.“He didn’t even bother to show up here in person,” Kaplan said. She said much of what he said in his deposition and in public statements “actually supports our side of the case.”“In a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself,” she said. “He knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll.”Carroll, 79, testified that she had a chance encounter with Trump at the Bergdorf Goodman store across the street from Trump Tower. She said it was a lighthearted interaction in which they teased each other about trying on a piece of lingerie before Trump became violent inside a dressing room.Tacopina told jurors there was no reason to call Trump as a witness when Carroll can't even recall when her encounter with Trump happened.He told the jury Carroll made up her claims after hearing about a 2012 “Law and Order” episode in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of the lingerie section of a Bergdorf Goodman store.“They modeled their secret scheme on an episode of one of the most popular shows on television,” he said of Carroll.Two of Carroll's friends testified that she told them about the encounter with Trump shortly after it happened, many years before the “Law and Order” episode aired.",National,"Tue, 09 May 2023 15:28:33 EST",d9a52fb0b6e3ee3f0ce49acc9545d198

But protecting writers from the negative impacts of these technologies is not an easy proposition.According to a forthcoming report from The Authors Guild, the median income for a full-time writer last year was $23,000. And writers' incomes declined by 42% between 2009 and 2019.The advent of text-based generative AI applications like GPT-4 and Bard, that scrape the Web for authors' content without permission or compensation and then use it to produce new content in response to users' prompts, is giving writers across the country even more cause for worry.""There's no urgent need for AI to write a novel,"" said Alexander Chee, the bestselling author of novels like Edinburgh and The Queen of the Night. ""The only people who might need that are the people who object to paying writers what they're worth.""Chee is among the nearly 8,000 authors who just signed a letter addressed to the leaders of six AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta.""It says it's not fair to use our stuff in your AI without permission or payment,"" said Mary Rasenberger, CEO of The Author's Guild. The non-profit writers' advocacy organization created the letter, and sent it out to the AI companies on Monday. ""So please start compensating us and talking to us.""Rasenberger said the guild is trying to get these companies to settle without suing them.""Lawsuits are a tremendous amount of money,"" Rasenberger said. ""They take a really long time.""But some literary figures are willing to fight the tech companies in court.Authors including Sarah Silverman, Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad recently signed on as plaintiffs in class action lawsuits alleging Meta and/or OpenAI trained their AI programs on pirated copies of their works. The plaintiffs' lawyers, Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick, couldn't be reached in time for NPR's deadline and the AI companies turned down requests for comment.Gina Maccoby is a literary agent in New York. She says the legal actions are a necessary step towards getting writers a fair shake.""It has to happen,"" Maccoby said. ""That's the only way these things are settled.""Maccoby said agents, including herself, are starting to talk to publishers about featuring language in writers' contracts that prohibits unauthorized uses of AI as another way to protect their livelihoods, and those of their clients. (According to a recent Authors Guild survey about AI, while 90% of the writers who responded said that ""they should be compensated for the use of their work in training AI,"" 67% said they ""were not sure whether their publishing contracts or platform terms of service include permissions or grant of rights to use their work for any AI-related purposes."")""What I hear from colleagues is that most publishers are amenable to restricting certain kinds of AI use,"" Maccoby said, adding that she has yet to add such clauses to her own writers' contracts. The Authors Guild updated its model contract in March to include language addressing the use of AI.The major publishers NPR contacted for this story declined to comment.Maccoby said even if authors' contracts explicitly forbid AI companies from scraping and profiting from literary works, the rules are hard to enforce.""How does one even know if a book is in a data set that was ingested by an AI program?"" Maccoby said. In addition to letters, lawsuits and contractual language, the publishing sector is further looking to safeguard authors' futures by advocating for legislation around how generative AI can and cannot be used.The Author's Guild's Rasenberger said her organization is actively lobbying for such bills. Meanwhile, many hearings have been held at various levels of government on AI-related topics lately, such as last week's senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on AI and copyright.""Right now there's a lot of talking about it,"" said Rumman Chowdhury, a Responsible AI Fellow at Harvard University, who gave testimony at one such hearing in June. ""But we're not seeing yet any concrete legislation or regulation coming out.""Chowdhury said the way forward is bound to be messy.""Some of it will be litigated, some of it will be regulated, and some of it people will literally just have to shout until we're heard,"" she said. ""So right now, the best we can do is ask the AI companies 'pretty, pretty please,' and hopefully somebody will respond.""Audio and digital stories edited by Meghan Collins Sullivan.

Ogletree Jr. reveal a mentor whose phone 'never stopped ringing',https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/08/06/tributes-to-charles-j-ogletree-jr-reveal-a-mentor-whose-phone-never-stopped-ringing,"In addition to leading landmark civil rights cases, Ogletree guided generations of students, including Barack and Michelle Obama.","As the legal and academic worlds mourn the loss of one of the era's greatest minds, a flood of tributes point to yet another side of Harvard legal scholar Charles J. Ogletree Jr., who died on Friday: that of a selfless mentor.Ogletree, who passed away at the age of 70 after a long fight with Alzheimer's, was a trailblazer in advocating for civil rights. Among his accomplishments were the founding of the Criminal Justice Institute—a program at Harvard Law School that trains students to represent indigent defendants—and his work to seek reparations for the survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.Behind the scenes, though, Ogletree was also paving the way for the next generation of lawyers and activists—even when he was busy with an extremely packed schedule. “He always found the time to talk to students, and take them to lunch, give them career advice,” said Ronald Sullivan Jr., the director of the Criminal Justice Institute. “He always found time to do what he thought was important, and that's to pass things on to the next generation of lawyers.”Ogletree was a source of guidance for future leaders like Barack and Michelle Obama, who both went to Harvard Law School when Ogletree was teaching. In a statement, former President Obama said Ogletree’s reputation preceded him at Harvard. “He took time on weekends to run something called 'Saturday School' for Black students who didn’t necessarily have the support systems at home to get them through the difficult first years of law school,” the statement read. “Eventually, Saturday School became so popular that students of every background began showing up to hear Charles explain things in a way they could understand. It was an example of the kind of person Charles has always been: unfailingly helpful, and driven by a genuine concern for others.”""I was fortunate to learn from Professor Ogletree as a beginning law student and then again as the executive director of the National Bar Association,"" tweeted Demetris Cheatham, who was the first woman to lead that organization. ""He poured into the cup of so many.""It's that sort of guidance that may be what is remembered most by those who knew him. Ronald Sullivan first met Ogletree, better known by many as simply ""Tree,"" when Sullivan entered Harvard Law School as a student. Sullivan went on to become a research assistant for Ogletree, a babysitter for his children and eventually the director of the Criminal Justice Institute. While Ogletree’s work representing high profile clients like Tupac Shakur and Anita Hill might have helped make him a big name, Sullivan said the impact he made on the lives of everyday people was nothing short of amazing.“Day in and day out, his phone never stopped ringing. And Tree rarely, if ever, said 'no,'” Sullivan said. “He was a man who was service-oriented. He gave and gave and gave and that seemed to be his mission in life.”Charles J. Ogletree Jr. had a familiarity with the less fortunate: he grew up poor in Merced, California, raised by seasonal farm laborers before attending Stanford University, then Harvard.In a message to the campus community, Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning said Friday that Ogletree had a ""monumental impact"" on the school.""His extraordinary contributions stretch from his work as a practicing attorney advancing civil rights, criminal defense, and equal justice to the change he brought to Harvard Law School as an impactful institution builder to his generous work as teacher and mentor who showed our students how law can be an instrument for change,"" he said.",Local,"Sun, 06 Aug 2023 19:13:56 EST",f26485f53aa14a880a9832984fe08b30
7081,What’s next for Massachusetts’ pandemic policies?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/07/20/whats-next-for-massachusetts-pandemic-policies,"So far, lawmakers have mostly opted for temporary extensions.","This story first ran in GBH News’ politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get our rundown of the Massachusetts’ latest political happenings every Thursday morning straight to your inbox.SeparatorWhen the State House closed this week after a basement electrical fire, elected officials and their staffs pivoted to remote work — including virtual votes Wednesday to approve seven pardons Gov. Maura Healey recommended.It’s the kind of adjustment that might not have been feasible before work-from-home protocols took shape in the pandemic’s early days. Remote work is one COVID-19 innovation that’s found a place in this post-emergency phase, helping businesses and governments navigate not just public health crises but predicaments like fire investigations or commute gridlock from the Sumner Tunnel shutdown.Over the past three years, state officials instituted a host of policies aimed at solving pandemic-era problems that popped up in town halls, restaurants, hospitals and other settings.While some, such as the ability to remotely notarize documents, made their way permanently into the state’s law books, the fates of many others now rest in the hands of the Massachusetts Legislature. So far, lawmakers have mostly opted for temporary extensions rather than long-term policy decisions.I recently heard from families and advocates who want to keep, for good, a change adopted in assisted living residences. Pre-COVID, nurses in those facilities weren’t allowed to perform health care services like insulin injections for residents that need help, leaving family members to handle it themselves or hire outside professionals.An emergency order from then-Gov. Charlie Baker changed that, and lawmakers extended the permission through March of 2024. Falmouth resident Robert Smith says his diabetic dad’s health rebounded when he was able to get his insulin injections, at the same time each day, from nurses in his assisted living home.Smith backs a bill also supported by the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association, which would permanently let nurses in assisted living provide some services, including injections, eye drops and oxygen management. Another industry group, the Massachusetts Senior Care Association, has concerns with the idea, particularly around consumer protections.A similar dynamic is at play on a very different issue. Lawmakers will also have to weigh competing interests as they decide whether restaurants should retain their ability to sell to-go cocktails with takeout orders. Restaurants like it, but package stores don’t.In both cases, proponents of permanently keeping the pandemic policy say short-term extensions have left businesses on uneasy footing as they try to plan their operations.Good-government advocates and disability rights activists are pushing, too, to make hybrid public meetings the law of the land. The expiration date on that isn’t looming quite as large – it’s in place through March 2025. Bills to make hybrid meetings permanent haven’t had a hearing yet, but when they do, expect testimony on how online options have knocked down barriers to civic participation.And expect it to be a while still before concrete answers emerge on pandemic policies. State lawmakers have a habit of acting once they’re up against a deadline, and that’s been the case as each round of temporary extensions has neared its end date.",Politics,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 09:35:56 EST",f75a038e8242286941e9d5b864fd104c

""When we eat the soup, it warms us,"" she says.Kilinçli and her mother have just picked up two steaming cups of lentil soup from volunteer chefs. They cook the soup in 70-gallon metal cauldrons. Because gas and electrical service has been knocked out throughout the area, the lentil soup is bubbling over in pots that sit on cinder blocks over open wood fires.Other food is also being distributed to the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless by the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake. But throughout the quake-affected zone, lentil soup is a staple.It's a familiar dish – one of the traditional soups in the area around the city of Gaziantep, home to some 2 million residents. But that's not the only reason for its popularity.""It is very quick to cook the lentil soup even in an emergency state. Also it is easy to serve,"" says Gülay Bozkurt, a nutritionist and food engineer in a municipal kitchen that used to prepare free hot meals to distribute to 21 locations across the city. Now the kitchen is serving meals to quake survivors and relief workers.People can eat it without any utensils, straight out of a bowl, she says. ""You can eat it standing up. It is very practical.""""It's very nutritious,"" she adds, rattling off statistics about the calories, grams of protein, carbohydrates and vitamins per serving.""Also it's loaded with onions and garlic,"" which, she says, help ward off infections and colds.In short, it's a supersoup, especially during a humanitarian disaster. It warms the displaced, fuels rescue crews and serves as a comfort food for residents traumatized by the disaster, even those whose homes survived. Many of themcan't cook at home because the quakes destroyed gas and electric lines.Faruk Izi is the director of the kitchen where Bozkurt oversees the lentil soup. He says that in the first days of this crisis, when so many people had lost their homes or were afraid to return to them, two things were essential.""First it was water and then it was soup,"" he says. The first meal his facility prepared after the earthquake was lentil soup, huge vats of lentil soup. Normally Izi's municipal kitchen provides 13,000 meals a day. On the first day after the quake he says they distributed soup to more than 200,000 people.""The most important thing that people need is something hot. Therefore we started to cook soup,"" he says. ""We offered lentil soup and tea. In this cold weather having something hot is very important and soup is very important.""Their soup kitchen didn't sustain any damage, he notes – it's a government structure built to rigorous construction standards. The worst thing that happened was that some of the soup spilled.Mikail Dağtekin, the head chef at the kitchen, says part of the beauty of lentil soup is its simplicity.""First we boil the water,"" he says. ""We add some olive oil and salt to the water."" Then he adds 45 grams of lentils –or roughly a quarter of a cup – for each person they plan to feed. For Dağtekin that means dumping 55-pound sacks of pinkish lentils into the pot. Then he adds in onions and garlic.""Onion and garlic is the most important part of it. You can't do without them,"" he says.Dağtekin, a chef for 30 years, says there is no need for him to set a timer. ""Boil it for a while,"" he says. When the lentils are soft, they're done. Then he mashes them with a long immersion blender that looks more like a power drill than a cooking utensil.If he has meat broth, he adds broth. If he has no broth, he skips it.Then he adds enough flour to thicken the soup.Meanwhile, in another pot he heats up cold-extracted olive oil – that's a process that reportedly retains more nutrients. (Some other chefs say they use liters of melted butter for this step.) To the oil, he adds cumin, bay leaves and ground pepper both black and red. Let the spices seep into the oil but don't let it get too hot, he says. Then he adds some tomato paste into the oil and spices.The final step in his recipe: Stir the oil mixture into the mashed lentils. Serve hot.Asked for the secret to making a really good lentil soup, Dağtekin doesn't miss a beat. ""We add into it our love,"" he says with a warm, broad smile.At a time when so many people affected by the quake are facing so many hardships, the warmth of a traditional soup is about more than just the temperature of the bowl.Samantha Balaban and Tuğba Öcek contributed to this story [Copyright 2023 NPR]",International News,"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 13:19:00 EST",5ddac90b556209e32eeb6aef874480cf
88,He had a plane to himself after an 18-hour delay. What happened next was a wild ride,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/07/07/he-had-a-plane-to-himself-after-an-18-hour-delay-what-happened-next-was-a-wild-ride,Phil Stringer lived both a traveler's nightmare and dream come true all in one day recently when he waited out an 18-hour flight delay to find himself the only passenger on the plane.,"Phil Stringer lived both a traveler's nightmare and dream come true all in one day recently when he waited out an 18-hour flight delay to find himself the only passenger on the plane. Stringer, 34, is the chief operating officer of a real estate brokerage and also consults with businesses about using AI. He travels frequently for work and, despite the many woes plaguing the airline industry, says his trips have generally gone smoothly — until one Sunday late last month. His early-morning flight home from Oklahoma City to Charlotte, N.C., was incrementally delayed throughout the course of the day for maintenance reasons, so he set up shop at an airport Starbucks (and, when it closed, a table nearby). When he was finally called to his gate just before midnight, he found it nearly empty. ""I had thought that everyone had boarded and I was late, because no one was there,"" Stringer told NPR in a Zoom interview. ""But [the gate agent] was like, 'No, honey, you're the only one left.' "" It was just Stringer and four flight attendants, whom he says were called back from their hotel for the roughly two-and-a-half-hour flight. He says they collectively decided to make the best of the less-than-ideal circumstances. They spent the flight cracking jokes, teasing and just chatting with each other, an experience he documented in a now-viral TikTok video.""We were like, look, we can either be negative about the situation and make a bad situation worse by our attitude, or we can be positive, lighthearted ... and try and make something of this and at least just have fun,"" Stringer says.That positive outlook surely came in handy when, after the flight finally landed around 3:30 a.m. local time, Stringer realized his long-checked bag was lost. He found it after about 45 minutes, then drove an hour to Greensboro, stopped home for a quick shower and went to work. That could have been the end of that. But two things happened.For one: Stringer and the flight attendants have kept in touch, texting regularly in a group chat about their day-to-day lives and viral fame. He's even bought plane tickets to visit them at their home base in Dallas later this month. And Stringer's been getting all sorts of calls and supportive messages from people who've seen his TikTok, which has garnered more than 10 million likes. He says he's heard from television producers who want to make episodes about his experience, and even got an invitation to join the celebrity video-sharing platform Cameo. Stringer had a feeling that the video would take off, but not to the extent that it has. The most moving messages, he adds, are from strangers who say it made them smile even during a hard time and think about how they can incorporate some of that positivity into their own lives. ""People have reached out and thanked me for literally shifting their perspective on their bad situation to where they can smile or they can be kind to another person or pass it on to someone else,"" Stringer says. ""And so that's been really cool to see, and something I didn't really expect with the video."" The economics of single-passenger flightsStringer hadn't been intent on spending a full day at the airport — he tried to re-book his flight, but figured out it was the only option that would get him home in time for his Monday morning meetings. He didn't realize how long he would end up waiting, or just how much the airport would clear out in the meantime. When he finally got to the gate, he says, it was a ""ghost town."" ""I almost felt badly because I was like, 'Man, they're going to fly this whole plane for one person. Like, that's such a waste,' "" he says. ""And then two minutes later, the whole flight crew walks in and they look and they see that I'm the only person. They're like, 'Are you freaking kidding me?' ""They all wondered why the flight wasn't just canceled. Stringer says the gate agent offered him a few reasons, including that airlines make more money on the cargo they transport than passengers, and they still have to get their planes to the next destination for takeoff. ""So it seems like they would have flown the plane with or without me,"" he says. Other fliers have gotten commercial planes to themselves in recent years, including a woman traveling from New York City to Washington, D.C., in 2018; a Lithuanian man flying to Italy in 2019, a Florida college student on his way back from England last year and a passenger headed from Portugal to Ireland in April. Stringer says he hasn't heard anything from American Airlines — not when he spent several hours on hold with them from the airport trying unsuccessfully to get a refund, nor in the wake of his story going viral. ""We know it can be frustrating when travel plans get delayed and are thankful for our crew members who went above and beyond to care for Mr. Stringer during his flight,"" American told NPR in a statement, without responding to specific questions.The importance of a good attitudeStringer credits the crew's positivity with turning his tough travel day around.As soon as the flight attendants saw him at the gate, he says, they began teasing him for single-handedly forcing them back to work in the middle of the night. They joked good-naturedly that he'd be sitting in a middle seat in the back of the plane, with no snacks or drinks.""And I was like, 'OK, that's fair. That's fine. But let's see how many times I can hit that call light. Like, this is going to be fun,'"" he recalls. ""And so that kind of built a fun rapport between us before we even boarded."" There are certain announcements the crew had to make, by law, even though they had an audience of one, Stringer says. So he got a personalized safety demo, as well as a special shout-out at the end of every PA announcement: ""Yes, Phil, we're only talking to you."" He says they laughed a lot, got to know each other and even tried to find some games — like bingo — to play on the way. They made sure to trade numbers by the end of the flight.As he sees it, the people who can be positive in a negative situation are the type of people he wants to stay connected with. Stringer calls himself a firm believer that a person's attitude determines their direction in whatever they do.And he hopes that's one lesson people take from his experience:""If you're going through a hard time, if you're going through a difficult season in anything — or it could be something as silly as a delayed flight — if you choose to shift your focus to something positive, you can absolutely change the situation just by changing your perspective and your attitude.""

6451,Forced labor allegations against Stash's Pizza owner is indicative of many in Massachusetts,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/17/forced-labor-allegations-against-stashs-pizza-owner-is-indicative-of-many-in-massachusetts,Advocates say abuse of undocumented workers is common,"A day after the owner of a Boston-area pizzeria chain was charged with forced labor and abuse of an immigrant worker in federal court, local advocates say it’s likely there are many more exploited workers in our region who go unidentified. Audrey Richardson, a managing attorney with the nonprofit Greater Boston Legal Services, said the organization is “familiar with the case.” She frequently sees similar situations of exploited workers too afraid to seek help. She said a lot of undocumented workers feel like they can’t come forward because of threats of deportation and losing their livelihoods“[These cases] might not rise to the level of being just so violent, and so off the charts for such a long period of time,"" Richardson told GBH News. ""But the same elements of employers who want to intimidate and threaten workers to take advantage of them and to keep them working and to not pay them what they're owed are there."" Stavros Papantoniadis, owner of Stash’s Pizza in Dorchester and Roslindale, was arrested Thursday on allegations that he physically assaulted undocumented employees, withheld wages, forced workers to work over 80 hours a week for little or no pay and threatened them with deportation. One alleged victim detailed claims of being kicked, choked and assaulted so severely that he had to have all of his teeth removed, according to a federal affidavit. He said Papantoniadis yelled Muslim slurs as he was beaten and threatened his life. The man said he worked there for nearly 14 years, partly in fear of being deported.Papantoniadis couldn’t be reached for comment. He has yet to enter a plea and is being held pending a detention hearing on Monday. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Mohammed Missouri, executive director of Jetpac — a Cambridge-based nonprofit seeking to elect American Muslims — says the case also reflects anti-Muslim bigotry that contributes to people not seeking help. The organization refers individuals in the Muslim community who experience workplace harassment to the Council on American-Islamic Relations – Massachusetts and other advocacy and civil rights groups for resources.“If you feel like you're in a situation that can't be necessarily helped by you speaking out, you're not going to speak out,” he said. This is the first case of forced labor filed by U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins’ office since she took the job last year. Since then, she has created a human trafficking unit focused on sex and labor violations. Rollins called the allegations “horrific” in a press release on Thursday but said the problem of forced labor is widespread. “Labor trafficking is real and happening every day in Massachusetts and beyond,’’ she said. “We are working hard to expose this disturbing crime and to hold those that abuse and traffic people accountable.”The problem of forced labor, often hidden in plain sight, has been the topic of an ongoing investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. GBH News reporters have spoken with restaurant and construction workers and domestic cleaners, among others, who have detailed working long hours for little or no pay, who are fearful of deportation, abuse and even homelessness.Audrey Richardson encouraged workers at Stash’s Pizza and other businesses who think they’re dealing with labor violations to reach out to Greater Boston Legal Services and community worker centers that work with immigrants. She said there have been recent efforts at the federal level to better help victims.In January, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new process that grants “deferred action” for workers who are witnesses or could potentially be witnesses in a labor dispute being investigated by a government agency. The status allows immigrants to work legally and protects them from deportation. “It really does allow workers the feeling that they can come forward, that they're protected, that they will have the ability to come out of the shadows and work lawfully,’’ Richardson said. It is unclear if any of the alleged victims in this case accessed that new process, but according to the affidavit, Department of Homeland Security agents helped several immigrant workers at Stash’s Pizza acquire immigration benefits, including “continued presence,” which allows them to remain in the U.S. legally under human trafficking laws. The Department of Homeland Security also signed a supportive document, called certification, that helps one of the victims in their application for a T-visa, which is an option for victims of forced labor and sex trafficking. Certain victims can remain in the U.S. legally for four years if the federal government grants that benefit.",Local,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 17:27:52 EST",c5c30b67ac4e0702441d1cca341ab977
6069,Boston’s police oversight office has yet to uphold a single civilian complaint,https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/01/bostons-police-oversight-office-has-yet-to-uphold-a-single-civilian-complaint,Experts say it takes time to roll out new systems — and that continued scrutiny is key.,"Nearly two years after its executive director was hired, and roughly one year after it began to operate in earnest, Boston’s Office of Police Accountability and Transparency has yet to sustain any civilian complaints against the Boston Police Department or to issue subsequent recommendations for disciplinary action, according to a review of city data by GBH News. A data dashboard on the office’s website says that in 2022 OPAT, as the office is widely known, received 56 complaints from civilians about the BPD, which employs more than 2,000 officers, and that 21 of those complaints were deemed lacking. But according to a city spokesperson, that doesn’t include more than two dozen complaints that were quickly dismissed upon initial review rather than being sent to OPAT’s Civilian Review Board for deeper consideration. When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending. The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternate mechanism through which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them. As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD. The abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking — especially given the high hopes that accompanied Boston’s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case. Everett, who was appointed as OPAT’s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role. Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.“There are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,” Everett said. “They can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.” For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT’s existence may not be enough.“While we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don’t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,” she said. “I started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it’s also a very hard ask. They don’t know who I am. They don’t know who this agency is. ... We’re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.” OPAT, which was created by a 2020 city ordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD’s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review. Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under the ordinance that created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annual report sent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether. In that same report, Everett said OPAT’s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission — like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder. In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it’s often called, mandated that investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted. “Our department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,” Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement. Gianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected. “It’s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,” Irlando said. “You have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you’re going to have access situations — because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don’t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.” Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it’s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity’s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don’t know or trust a particular oversight agency — or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well. Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who is tracking and analyzing the proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts. “The best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,” Fairley said. “And what’s good about what’s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, ‘OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.’ And then that audience — the public — can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.” Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Board can be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainant claimed they’d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent “audit” of the BPD’s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which they believed officers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights. But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago’s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.“On paper, it looked fantastic,” Fairley said. “It was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have. “You are right to be watchful,” she added. “Because we want to make sure these entities as they’re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they’ve been given over time.”",Politics,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:00:15 EST",aee50f34f54c6b6ea45590bcd8ce7eae
4424,Local Jewish advocates are fighting antisemitism with a five-step plan,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/15/local-jewish-advocates-are-fighting-antisemitism-with-a-five-step-plan,"The push was unveiled as antisemitic incidents rise, both in Boston and nationwide.","Local leaders and Jewish advocates gathered at TD Garden Monday to address the alarming rise in antisemitic incidents in Boston and nationwide. The event, hosted by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, launched the group’s ‘Face Jewish Hate’ campaign in collaboration with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. Robert Kraft, the 81-year-old founder of the foundation and owner of the New England Patriots, told the crowd that the America he sees today reflects Germany in the late 1930s. “We’re seeing neo-Nazis raising swastikas and demonstrating, saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and ‘down with the Jews,’” Kraft said. “This is the United States of America in 2023. There’s no room for that kind of hate — or hate of any kind.” The campaign features a five-point plan: Face Jewish hate, empower the community, build allyship, inform and educate the next generation and strengthen communal security. Those steps were determined by a task force of community leaders and experts on combating antisemitism with antisemitic incidents on the rise. According to the Anti-Defamation League, there were over 3,600 reported antisemitic incidents across the country in 2022 — the highest number on record since the ADL began tracking the incidents more than 40 years ago. In Massachusetts, antisemitic incidents jumped 41% from 2021 to 2022. Along with top elected officials like Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Attorney General Andrea Campbell, local Jewish leaders like Kraft addressed the crowd. Speakers stood in front of screens that shared stories of local antisemitic hate crimes, like that of Rabbi Shlomo Loginski, who was stabbed eight times last summer in Brighton outside of a Jewish school. Loginski attended the event but did not address the crowd. Dr. Jeremy Schiller, who, during his tenure as the Chair of the Salem Board of Health during the COVID-19 pandemic, received several antisemitic messages and threats from people who opposed vaccination and mitigation efforts. He said that, on top of his outrage and indignation, he also felt a growing sense of loneliness and isolation from the lack of attention to antisemitic hate during the pandemic. “If [antisemitism] is not called out, if our communities stay silent, then we enter into that same dangerous debate,” he said. “That’s sending me a yellow star or depicting me with a noose around my neck to my kids, or equating COVID mitigation measures ... to Nuremberg laws.” Members of other faiths also spoke on the resurgence of antisemitism locally and nationally. Cardinal Sean Patrick O’Malley, who serves as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, said he was stunned to hear Jewish leaders’ testimony at a joint Catholic and Jewish community event about the measures Jewish folks must take to practice their faith safely. “I was horrified to hear about how they have to have their services with doors locked in all kinds of security and cameras and armed guards,” he said. “Racism and antisemitism have always been the original sins of our country, and we must never let our guard down.”",Local,"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:33:51 EST",f219556994ba52991854e5f802322f2d

5390,How a Boston hospital transformed a Ukrainian child’s life,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/27/how-a-boston-hospital-transformed-a-ukrainian-childs-life,A shelling in Nikopol turned everything upside down for a Ukrainian family. It eventually brought one young girl and her godmother to Boston.,"In October, six-year-old Karolina Daremyan was sleeping with her mother when Russian forces shelled their home in Nikopol, Ukraine. The mother was hospitalized, and the young child’s injuries were so severe that both of her legs were amputated below the knee.United Nations human rights watchers have recorded over 500 children killed and almost 1,000 injured since the Russian invasion in February 2022. They think the true figures are considerably higher. The Ukranian hospital system has been overwhelmed, and only a fraction of those injured children have been able to make the difficult journey to the United States for complicated medical procedures and rehabilitation.Karolina is one of the lucky ones.She and her godmother would become beneficiaries of a tight-knit network of do-gooders, traveling to get Karolina medical care at the renowned Shriners Children’s Hospital in Boston. The hospital has helped nearly 2,000 international children since 2005.“The medical system is so stressed [in Ukraine], the high-resource needy cases are very difficult to support,” said Dr. Robert Sheridan, Shriners’ chief of staff. “A case that perhaps they could have managed before February 2022, they just are completely overwhelmed that they don't have the resources that that child would need.” Since Russia’s invasion, five Ukrainian children have made their way to Shriners in Boston, and another six have gone to other hospitals in the Shriners network across the country — including one child who lost her arm, and another injured in a collapsed building due to a missile strike. Karolina and her family found their way to a Polish refugee camp in late spring, where they met Daria Khatina. The 35-year-old, also Ukrainian, became a close friend.Months later, the family decided to leave the camp and go back to Ukraine. But just hours after they returned to Nikopol, Russians shelled their home.“I didn’t want to believe it, I couldn’t believe that it happened the same exact day. It was shocking, it was painful and it was hard,” Khatina said in an interview interpreted from Ukrainian. With her mother hospitalized, Karolina was shuttled from one hospital to another that might better perform her amputation. Her aunt was posting on Facebook about the horrific event, and supporters around the world were sending their condolences and suggesting what could be done to help the little girl. Karolina’s family was ultimately connected to the Ukrainian Embassy to the United States and Ukraine House, a D.C.-based nonprofit founded by the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska.The two groups reached out to Shriners, which reviewed her case and accepted her for treatment. With Karolina’s father taking care of her two younger siblings, Khatina volunteered to accompany Karolina on the journey, taking on a new role as godmother and leaving her own three children behind. Ukraine House and the embassy arranged travel and coordinated visitor visas.On top of the embassy’s typical work in sanctions, weaponry and geopolitics, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States said her office wanted to get involved with humanitarian aid during the war and reach beyond their typical duties. Young students in Ukraine now, ambassador Oksana Markarova said, only study out of their school’s basements to be protected from shellings. “No children have to be subjected to that,” Markarova said in an interview with GBH News. “This unfair, unprovoked, completely unjustified war is not only unfair to our country, but then you meet children like Karolina and you see what devastating effect it has on people and families, on kids.”Moving into humanitarian aid is how the embassy ended up helping Karolina. When the war started, the nonprofit Ukraine House shifted its focus, too, from cultural programs and promoting cross-cultural exchange to fundraising. They launched a program last year called “Unbreakable,” a prosthetics rehabilitation program that Karolina is part of.Khatina had thought Shriners would be “very hospital,” but was delighted to see the bright colors and toys that made it a lot less scary.Khatina and Karolina flew to Boston in January. Volunteers brought together by a local Facebook group met them at Logan Airport with welcome signs and teddy bears. They went straight to Shriners, staying in hospital apartments while Karolina underwent a laundry list of medical tests to make sure she didn’t need further operations.Luckily she didn’t, and prosthetic care could start.Karolina’s team included Brock McConkey, manager of pediatric orthotics and prosthetics, and physical therapist Hilary Smith.“My first meeting with Karolina, she was sitting there smiling, big and bright,” McConkey said. “It’s tough coming from another country and instilling trust in a foreigner, so I try to just present with some big smiles and laughs, and try not to take things too seriously. And she was very warm and welcoming to us.”She was fitted for prostheses, which arrived a few days later.In a video from that day, Karolina watched as McConkey unwrapped a bright pink prosthetic piece, covered in stickers. “That’s the one,” he said while she nodded.They put on the liners to protect her knees, and then the socket, a prosthetic piece that grips the residual limb. What happened next was unexpected.“She stood up and took off right away. I don’t think in all my years at the Shrine, I’ve had a patient jump up as quickly as she has, and take off,” McConkey said.“We were extremely emotional, me and Karolina,” Khatina said in an interview, wiping away tears. “She was already knowing it wasn’t just gonna be new legs. They won’t just magically grow. She knew it would be a new leg, but different, special legs.”Those first steps happened in February. Khatina and Karolina stayed at a nearby apartment for outpatient treatment for over a month while Karolina’s left knee got stronger and she learned to live with her prosthetic legs.In just six weeks, she re-learned how to walk, run, bike and even play basketball. McConkey, Smith and the medical team at Shriners saw key improvements to Karolina’s progress, particularly that she could play with other kids for long periods of time without exhaustion or pain.Smith video-chatted with Karolina’s mother about her continued care. She will outgrow the prosthetics within the year and return to Boston for new ones.On Karolina’s last day at Shriners, her medical team brought her in for a final physical therapy session before she left Boston. The bright room was filled with toys and tools: scooters, bikes, a set of stairs to practice walking up and down, a little basketball hoop in the corner and a few short kids tables where she could sit and draw. But Karolina didn’t want to draw: she was energetic and ready to get moving. There was just one problem: she couldn’t decide between riding a red scooter or a green bike. Either way she needed a helmet. McConkey handed her a pink one.Khatina said Karolina was excited to see her family but doesn’t realize the danger in Ukraine. She doesn’t talk about the night of the shelling.“Karolina is very strong and brave. And she doesn’t talk about it. She’s not saying anything about what happened, what she felt,” Khatina said.Before they left Boston in mid-March, they visited the New England Aquarium. The pair had gone when Karolina was in her wheelchair in the weeks after they arrived to Massachusetts.“She was just running from the one pool to another pool,” Khatina said. “She was so excited to be able to explore it herself, on her own new legs. And for me it was just a pleasure to see her be able to do all of it by herself, without having to be in the wheelchair.”Khatina said the war “changed every single Ukrainian,” and that she was grateful to see so much support from the United States, not just for Karolina but also for her country.“The only thing I want to say is that as a mother, I want my kids to be healthy, happy, and safe,” she said. “We want to feel safe to go to bed. We want to be sure that we’ll be awake in the morning.”",Local,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 05:00:30 EST",2f0f438cd99dd85285718071a9640705

Elizabeth Warren balked on GBH's Boston Public Radio when asked if President Joe Biden should pick Kamala Harris to run with him again in 2024. The story blew up, then faded away after Warren issued a clarification saying she fully supported Biden's and Harris's reelection. But now it's back with a vengeance, thanks to CNN reporting that found Warren has called Harris twice to apologize and Harris still hasn't called her back.Whether Warren intended to jab at Harris is debatable, but one thing is certain: Harris has been under scrutiny in recent months, and the portraits painted of her performance as vice president have generally been unflattering. Adam Reilly is joined by GBH News' Callie Crossley and the Boston Globe's Renée Graham to discuss what's driving that negativity, the role Harris may have played in the Democrats' stronger-than-expected performance in the midterms, and whether the negative narrative surrounding Harris might also reflect deep-seated anxiety about Biden.

7300,‘Scared’ and ‘disturbed’: Unease deepens around widespread access to abortion medication in Mass.,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/14/scared-and-disturbed-unease-deepens-around-widespread-access-to-abortion-medication-in-mass,What the legal limbo is like for abortion providers: a “perfect storm nightmare.”,"Updated April 14 at 4:13 p.m.Gov. Maura Healey declared midday Monday that a common abortion drug “will remain safe, legal and accessible here in Massachusetts.” But a couple days later, the limits of that vow were already being tested. Wednesday night’s order from an appeals court will keep the drug, mifepristone, legal across the country, following a Texas judge’s decision last week that would have suspended its FDA approval. But the appeals court will allow years-old restrictions on when and how it can be distributed to women seeking abortions, a decision the Justice Department quickly appealed. In an order Friday, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito postponed those restrictions from going into place until Wednesday night at the soonest. It’s created murky legal territory for providers and patients as they hope for clarity. The new order will shorten the timeframe mifepristone is approved for, from 10 weeks to 7 weeks of pregnancy; reverse the decision that allowed patients to receive the drug by mail; require multiple in-person visits; and limit which medical professionals are allowed to prescribe the drug. Providers and legal experts here in Massachusetts are closely watching how the Supreme Court will rule. Elizabeth Barnes said this week has been a “perfect storm nightmare” for women and providers.Barnes grew up on Martha’s Vineyard and is now president of The Women’s Centers, a group of independent abortion providers in Georgia, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The New Jersey clinic had just launched their mifepristone-by-mail telemedicine program this week and five patients were scheduled to get the abortion pills. They saw two of those patients earlier in the week, but mifepristone can no longer be sent through the mail after the new order goes into effect. The telemedicine director “had to break the news to these patients who were hysterically crying, could not figure out how they would change their planned schedule and call out of work so that they could now come in for services,” Barnes said.She said the provider was “heartbroken” that they had to turn the patients away so suddenly. They will have to find a clinic to get a surgical abortion — but Barnes notes that clinics in states where abortion is legal are already overburdened with people traveling across state lines to get abortions. Barnes said that Thursday one of the clinics treated a 14-year-old girl who had traveled more than 1,000 miles with her parents to access an abortion.Many hope that Massachusetts law will legally protect abortion providers and leave some discretion to individuals to use their medical judgment — for example, continuing to prescribe mifepristone after seven weeks. An executive order from Gov. Maura Healey Monday affirmed that a law signed last summer protects providers’ use of mifepristone, and UMass Amherst is stockpiling 15,000 doses of the drug at the governor’s request. But it’s not yet clear how far the law reaches to protect providers from legal liability.“Because of our Executive Order and large purchases of the medication, mifepristone will continue to be available in Massachusetts as it was before the ruling,” Healey said in a statement Thursday.Despite the reassurance from political leaders, providers and legal experts say the conflicting rulings and rapid changes are creating confusion. “You know, it could be different by the end of the day tomorrow,” said Sarah Burg, an attorney at Foley Hoag who advocates and works pro bono in the reproductive rights world. For providers, the confusion is disorienting. “People are scared and honestly very disturbed,” Julia Kehoe, president and CEO of Health Imperatives, which serves low-income populations at clinics in Hyannis, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket, Brockton, New Bedford, Plymouth and Wareham, said about their staff. Barnes said she’s frustrated that so much time has to be spent trying to figure out how conflicting legal opinions impact their day-to-day operations. “We’re spending hours and hours and hours on the phone and with our staff and our providers, again, trying to pivot around something that has absolutely nothing to do with the practice of medicine or the caring for people,” she said. “It’s the story of being an abortion provider. And I think in many ways it’s by design.”Attorney General Andrea Campbell said Friday that she “urged [the Supreme Court] to reject ... efforts to reinstate outdated and unwarranted restrictions on access to mifepristone.”The FDA is weighing two conflicting federal rulings. A second ruling out of Washington state, which came down minutes after the original Texas ruling last week, mandates that the FDA preserve existing access to mifepristone in 17 Democratic-led states after that group brought a lawsuit, a group that does not include Massachusetts. Dr. Danielle Roncari, vice president of medical services at Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, called the restrictions “severe” and not based in medicine. She said providers will hopefully be able to rely on new protections in Massachusetts to keep offering mifepristone to patients, regardless of what happens. “Right now, mifepristone’s approval has not changed and Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts will continue providing medication abortion care as usual,” Roncari said. Kehoe has been consulting with legal experts about whether medical staff could count on protections in Massachusetts to offer medication abortion. They plan to start offering medication abortion at their clinics and via telehealth in July with newly awarded funding from the state.“We’re still looking into that. And we've been in touch with some national organizations who are looking into that exact issue right now. And there may be a possibility, but we just don't know yet,” Kehoe said.Recent figures suggest that the changes set to go into effect would change how tens or hundreds of thousands of women in the United States get abortions each year.More than 40% of medication abortions in the United States were at or beyond seven weeks of pregnancy, according to a 2020 federal survey, something that would no longer be approved by the FDA.Lowering the limit to when a person can take mifepristone to seven weeks rather than 10 weeks is a significant change, Kehoe said, as many women don’t know they are pregnant at that point and are only just starting to consider their options.“We know that most people come [to the clinics] around or slightly after six weeks, six to nine weeks. Most people don't even know they're pregnant earlier than seven weeks,” she said. “And so this would require people to choose a surgical abortion, even if it's better for them to opt for the medication.”Prohibiting mifepristone to be sent through the mail would also be a significant barrier for patients, especially in rural areas, Kehoe said. A recent report found that one in 10 abortions nationally were provided by a virtual clinic, via telehealth, in December of last year. “I’m very concerned about the inability to mail the drugs, especially because we operate clinics in Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and then in large areas around Plymouth and the south coast where there's not a lot of access, whether it’s transportation barriers or other reasons, where people rely on getting through the mail,” she said. “So this would be a real problem and it would have a disparate impact on low-income people in communities without adequate transportation.”Update: This story was updated to include the order from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s action on the case.",Local,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 13:08:44 EST",ab9703710ec585332f34beb7a8a22155
1872,Black and Latino Legislative Caucus condemns ‘deeply concerning’ allegations of racism at convention center authority,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/08/black-and-latino-legislative-caucus-condemns-deeply-concerning-allegations-of-racism-at-convention-center-authority,An audit of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority is underway in response to allegations of racism and discrimination.,"Members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus have thrown their support behind a state audit of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority in response to allegations of racism and discrimination at the independent state authority. “The complaints filed by Black employees alleging discrimination in hiring, promotion, and working conditions, as well as the lack of diversity among the authority's top employees, are troubling,” Executive Director Závon Billups wrote in a statement on behalf of the caucus. “The fact that there is no diversity officer charged with creating opportunities for people of color is also a cause for concern.” Over the past month, five employees filed formal complaints with the state attorney general alleging racial bias against employees, vendors and convention guests, including heightened security at Black-sponsored events and pay inequity among employees, according to reporting from The Boston Globe.The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority is one of a few independent authorities in state government that does not have a diversity officer. A Globe review also found no Black employees among the 25 highest-paid employees at the authority, including leadership. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio has launched an audit of the authority, roughly one month after the release of a previous audit into its past performance that identified “several deficiencies” in compliance with state contract laws. “The issues raised by The Boston Globe and Andrea Estes are concerning and fall precisely within the realm of objectives I have enumerated in my social justice and equity audit plan,” DiZoglio said in a statement. Multiple employees of color sent an anonymous letter to Gov. Maura Healey in January, urging her to replace MCAA Executive Director David Gibbons and the rest of his leadership team. Healey’s office is conducting its own investigation into the allegations. “What has been raised and reported on is very concerning,” Healey told reporters on Tuesday. “We're currently reviewing all of that.” The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority “strongly refutes the assertions and the motivations behind them,” according to a spokesperson for the authority. “We take seriously the claim that any employee, client or guest feels discriminated against, mistreated, or undervalued.” The MCCA hired law firm Prince Lobel Tye LLP and principal attorney Walter Prince to “review our policies and procedures at present and in the past, including the experience of employees of color within the organization and any negative experience that an attendee of color may have had at the BCEC or Hynes.” The authority received formal notice of the audit, according to the spokesperson, and will be “working diligently” with DiZoglio’s office. In their anonymous letter to Healey, employees expressed concern about losing their jobs as a result of speaking out individually or drawing attention to cultural issues, according to the Globe. “This underscores the need for stronger protections for whistleblowers and for employers to create a culture of accountability and transparency,” Billups wrote in his statement on behalf of the Black and Latino Caucus. “The allegations of racial discrimination at the [authority] are deeply concerning, and it is critical that the authorities take swift action to investigate and address these issues.” Michael Curry, the former president of the NAACP Boston Branch, says he worked with David Gibbons to bring the NAACP national convention to Boston this summer. “Gibbons and I got together and said, 'We need to change Boston.' We proposed to the national NAACP bringing the convention here, and the convention is coming,” Curry said in an interview with GBH News. “I think that's a tremendous opportunity for [Gibbons] and the rest of his team to seize on that little victory, that relatively little victory, to then start getting big victories in systemic change within the Convention Center Authority.”This evaluation of the authority is an opportunity to investigate the lack of diversity among leadership at companies across the state, Curry said. “This is not unique to the Convention Center Authority. This is rampant throughout Massachusetts and particularly in Boston,” Curry said. “The reality is, too many C-suites and too many organizations are predominantly white and male. We've not yet cracked the code on how we tap into talent; women and people of color who have tremendous talent to offer these organizations. Shame on us and shame on the convention center if we don't meet the moment.”",Local,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 13:55:42 EST",18d80cec1e71ccfa0d224049069084a6

Officials at the New England Commission of Higher Education and the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education confirmed Mason's planned departure.The move is the latest episode in the unraveling of the college, a for-profit institution that's part of the publicly traded education conglomerate Ambow Education based in Beijing.GBH News first reported students' claims that Bay State defrauded them by overcharging them and canceling classes with little or no notice.In January, the Biden administration said it was closely tracking the financial health of Bay State and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for increased oversight. That prompted state education officials to take the rare step to rescind Bay State's accreditation status by the summer, ending the college's access to federal dollars and ability to grant degrees.The college is also facing eviction from its Back Bay campus on St. James Avenue after its landlord, OMV Park Square, sued the college for $720,000 in unpaid rent and fees.Mason joined Bay State in 1994 as an instructor in the English Department. He held several leadership positions at the college, rising to chief academic officer before taking the job as interim president.

(As it happens, I’ve been attending Bedside Baptist for a while now, but I digress.) Instead, at 11 a.m. on Sunday I’m firing up my laptop and signing into Google Meet for my weekly family conversation. We started this conversation three years ago when state officials issued orders to shut down all essential businesses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In each of our respective hometowns, my sister, twin niece and nephew and I found ourselves inside looking out. Former Gov. Charlie Baker announced the COVID shutdown in Massachusetts on March 10, 2020. Shutdowns happened 10 days later in New York where my nephew lives, and a week after that, in Minnesota where my niece lives. My sister isolated herself at home unwilling to wait for Tennessee’s official stay-at-home order which didn’t come until April 2.Those early days of uncertainty left us in emotional limbo. We didn’t know when next we would see each other. And while the four of us in my immediate family were accustomed to living apart because of our jobs, the COVID shutdowns had a disquieting effect. We had always kept in close contact with frequent phone calls, texts and emails, but suddenly none of that seemed enough. We needed a more satisfying way to stay in touch. So, like millions of other Americans, we turned to Zoom and other video online calling services. My niece, a full stack web developer, handled the tech, setting up a one-hour Sunday call. But an hour quickly became too short, so we set aside two hours. I can’t tell you how many times friends have exclaimed, “Two hours! What are you all talking about for two hours?” Nothing and everything. We sign on as we are in the moment: my niece generally curled up on her couch under a blanket; my sister off camera yelling that she’ll be with us when she’s done fixing her tea; my nephew, the professional dancer, often bleary eyed from a recent rehearsal or performance; and me plopped on my couch or snuggled down in my big chair. Our conversations are free flowing — they ramble, overlap and punctuate whatever is on our minds — from mundane work stories to hilarious incidents, to somber observations about the state of the world, to Black Twitter’s latest witty posts. Two hours fly by until we reluctantly say goodbye in an outpouring of cascading “Love you” and “See you next Sunday.” Occasionally, each of us has had to call in from another location, or cut the time short, or miss the call altogether. But the conversation has never stopped.Because of the Sunday calls, my family and I really know each other now. We treasure family vacations and other occasions when we are in each other’s company. How lucky that we found a silver lining from a global pandemic which left so many feeling lonely and disconnected. We mark the third anniversary of COVID shutdowns this month grateful for our health and our stronger family bond. Next Sunday morning can’t come soon enough.",Commentary,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 05:00:34 EST",8fb42c3e60c8876519a8082a3df39b74
2459,"MIT takes steps to stop foreign espionage, but some faculty say it goes too far",https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/03/01/mit-takes-steps-to-stop-foreign-espionage-but-some-faculty-say-it-goes-too-far,New security measures include FBI briefings and required disclosure forms for suspicious activities.,"MIT materials researcher Yoel Fink said he had never seen anything like it in his nearly 30 years as a scientist at one of the world's premiere engineering universities.In a small MIT conference room with the blackout shades pulled down, FBI agents told him and other researchers in the fall that rogue nations like China, Russia and India were sending secret agents to steal intellectual property from university labs and asked them to take steps to stop it, including vetting their staff.“I've never had a formal threat briefing by law enforcement here,” Fink said, saying the experience left him shaken. “Law enforcement should come onto campus only when there is clear evidence of a crime.”Campus administrators at MIT are following new national security guidelines first announced under Trump and enacted by the Biden administration that are supposed to protect research labs from spying and international espionage. At MIT, that has meant not only on-campus briefings by the FBI, but a new requirement asking professors who receive federal funding to sign a disclosure form certifying that their students are not participating in suspicious activities. And while many MIT faculty aren’t happy about it, experts say it's a sign of what’s to come at other U.S. research universities.“It will absolutely be coming to you soon — if it's not there already,” said Kristin West, director of the Research Ethics and Compliance Committee at the Council on Governmental Relations, an association representing more than 200 top research institutions.Authorities have previously estimated intellectual property theft costs the U.S. $200 billion a year. But the steps have raised criticism that the government is going too far and will alienate talented researchers or discourage them from working in the U.S. West said concerns about xenophobia and the loss of global talent are legitimate.“I think you have to be afraid that somebody's going to throw the baby out with the bath water, because professors are just going to say, ‘This is too much trouble – puts me at too much risk. I'm just not going to bother with international collaborations anymore,’” she said. “And that hurts science.” Fears of law enforcement overreach are front of mind at MIT following the case of mechanical engineering professor Gang Chen, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was accused under the Trump administration of concealing his affiliation with the Chinese government in applications for grants he received from the U.S. Energy Department. The Justice Department abandoned the case, a high-profile one, when federal prosecutors said they could no longer meet the burden of proof at trial. Fink, the materials scientist, described Chen as “a brother,” saying the two men grew close following Chen’s arrest. Four months after the Justice Department dropped Chen’s case, about 60 researchers were briefed by the FBI about ongoing threats from foreign spies working in their labs in a power point presentation. Fink said the upshot was this: “You need to know that there may very well be spies on campus, and you need to try to find them.”MIT would not confirm the FBI’s meetings on its campus. A spokesperson said only that there are “occasional exchanges between researchers and various federal agencies on topics of mutual interest, which sometimes involve discussions regarding research security.”But in the months following the briefings, MIT began asking researchers who receive funding from the Department of Energy to sign a document that asks them to make “reasonable inquiry” with researchers to determine if they are participating in any recruitment programs involving China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran specifically.MIT said the form is a required part of federal guidelines, and that it has a history of advocating for ways to balance sensitive research security concerns with the need to offer a welcoming research environment.Under the CHIPS & Science Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in August, research universities that receive any federal funding will be required to certify that none of their researchers or students are participating in “a malign foreign talent recruitment program” starting next summer.U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm broadly defended the measure on a recent trip to Massachusetts. She said, “the whole genesis of this is to make sure that American taxpayer dollars fund American research and researchers.”Granholm said the focus is not on brilliant foreign researchers from around the world — or with the Chinese diaspora, like Gang Chen.“Our grievance is with the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party and making sure that America can remain competitive and can be a leader,” she said.And that has left some research experts wondering whether the new measures are misdirected.“We remain extremely concerned about the chilling impact on researchers, but also on our international students,” said Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education, an association representing 1,700 colleges and universities. “I think an international student trying to decide whether or not to come to study in the United States may look at some of these things and think, ‘You know, maybe I should just switch and study in Canada or in the UK, so it is a big concern,” Spreitzer said.MIT professors agree, and said the changes made them uneasy, and even fearful or paranoid around students and colleagues.Keith Nelson, who has taught physical chemistry at MIT for four decades, said suggesting professors investigate the backgrounds of their graduate students and postdocs is wholly unreasonable. He’s advising his younger colleagues not to sign. “As soon as I’m the one who has to sit down with my student from China and ask those questions, it can’t help but somehow poison the relationship,” Nelson said. “Afterall, I’m not asking that of my American citizen students.”Gabriela Schlau-Cohen, who teaches physical chemistry at MIT, said she was surprised when she was asked to sign the disclosure statement.After consulting with an attorney to better understand the document’s jargon, she said she has refused to sign it unless the university changes some of its language or allows her to make edits.“I’m not trained to do ‘reasonable inquiry,’” she said. “My goal is to educate my students, not to interrogate them.”It’s still unclear what the repercussions are for professors who refuse to sign the new affirmation form. Asked if they would lose their funding, a spokesperson for MIT only said that administrators are not aware of any researchers refusing to sign.Inside his lab in the basement below MIT’s iconic Great Dome, Fink, the materials scientist, equated the reaction to potential espionage to some key findings in his research exploring whether fabrics can monitor health risks in real-time. When the human body detects a small danger, he said, its reaction is sometimes worse than the threat itself.GBH News reporter Mark Herz contributed to this report.",Education,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 05:00:17 EST",c7c9cf9b28a1b1d03c26acce912de6b3
7057,"Analysis: The Celtics gave their all, but could not beat the Heat",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/30/analysis-the-celtics-gave-their-all-but-could-not-beat-the-heat,The Celtics' season has come to a heart-wrenching end.,"The Celtics' season came to a heart-wrenching end after losing game seven of the Eastern Conference finals to the Miami Heat last night at the Garden, 132-84. And with that, so did the C's chances of making history as the first team in the NBA to win a series after being down three games to nothing. GBH's Esteban Bustillos was at the game and joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about it on Tuesday morning. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So first off, before we get into everything that went wrong, there were quite a few celebrity sightings last night. There were a bunch of former Celtics. Esteban Bustillos: Yeah, there were. Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, I think I saw a couple more. Paris Alston: Trying to bring some of that '08 championship magic into the building. Bustillos: For as big of the comparisons about the '04 Red Sox were, there were not as many as I thought. They had Kevin Millar on video, I don't know if he was there in person. So that that was a little odd.Siegel: I also saw Donnie Wahlberg was there, 21 Savage, Aly Raisman, the Olympic gymnast. Before we do get into the game itself, being there in the company of all of these people, what was it like inside of the Garden, before things even got started?Bustillos: The energy was high. The energy was super high. As I mentioned about the '04 Red Sox comparisons, pre-game they had a hype video with a montage of some of the best moments from the '04 ALCS. Paul Pierce was just on the court, just impromptu hyping the crowd up. I mean, this was 30 minutes before the game. The whole place was hyped and then the game started. Alston: And what happened from there? Bustillos: It was really just the first possession. Jayson Tatum went up for a layup, drew contact with Miami's Gabe Vincent. He came down on his foot. Now, anyone who knows, who's ever played basketball, knows that when your foot lands on their player's foot, that's it. That's a graveyard for healthy ankles. And he just immediately was down in pain. There was a nervous murmur that spread throughout TD Garden. He did a pretty good job, I would say, of disguising that pain, but he just wasn't himself for the rest of the night. And Boston's groove was thrown off. Afterwards, Tatum walked with a limp in the press room. Jayson Tatum [previously recorded]: It, you know, kind of impacted me. The rest of the night it swelled up and it was just frustrating. And I was kind of like a shell of myself. It's tough to move. Siegel: So I didn't stay up to watch the game because Paris and I are on the air super early here. Paris actually did watch, which maybe she's regretting. So I've heard a little bit about this game. I mean, I know losing Tatum was big, but Boston only trailed by ten going into the fourth quarter. So what happened there? Bustillos: Yeah. So given the situation they were in with their best player essentially playing on one leg, Boston did a pretty good job of putting up a fight through three quarters. They actually outscored Miami 25-to-24 in that third quarter. The start of the fourth, though, Miami went on a 7-0 run, Boston was down 17, and that's just too hard of a hole to come out of. Boston, they played in hot spurts throughout the game, but Miami consistently hit shots, especially from three-point range, where they were 14 of 28, the Celtics were 9 of 42 from three. Boston would sometimes rush shots, they would look flustered on offense, and the offense just wasn't there. Jaylen Brown, who we're going to talk about a lot, he was 8 of 23 from the field for just 19 points and he just had a bad night when Boston needed him the most with Jayson Tatum, basically, again, just playing on one foot. Jaylen Brown [previously recorded]: You know, my team turned to me to make plays and etc., and I came up short. I failed. And it's tough. You know, I give credit to Miami, but just a terrible job. Alston: So there's no question here that the Celtics lost a key link in the chain with Jayson Tatum and the ankle injury. And I think there's a lot of speculation about how if only that hadn't happened. But at the same time, we've got to remember that Boston was clawing itself out of a 3-0 hole running into this game. So you're having to give 110% for four games in a row. So how much of this is that part of it? Bustillos: I mean, it's definitely part of it, right? There's a reason the Celtics were only the fourth team in NBA history to even be in that position, coming down from 3-0 to tie up the series. But, you know, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have to be perfect or where your health has to be perfect, to when you want to give yourself a little bit of room for error. And being 3-0, there is no more room for error. Al Horford said that they kind of had to play with desperation in the series after falling down the way they did. Al Horford [previously recorded]: There's a lot that goes into it physically, emotionally. There's a lot that goes into it and you get to this point and you still have to play another game. You still have to win another game. And trust me, every guy in the locker room, we wanted it really, really bad. And, you know, it's tough. But as hard as it is, you know, we have to learn from this. Siegel: Let's talk a little bit about learning from this, because going into the season, the C's were favored by a lot of people to make another run at the championship after getting to the finals last year. Where do they go from here? Bustillos: I think one of the big questions is what do they do with Jaylen Brown? He's going to be owed a supermax contract because he made an All-NBA team that would be up to $295 million. That's a lot of money. Will the Celtics want to pay that? Will they want to trade him? For people who want to trade him, my question would be, are you really ready to break up one of the best duos in the NBA with Tatum and Brown over the course of these past few years, even with how his season, especially at the end, went? Alston: So lastly here, Esteban, we've got to talk about Joe Mazzulla, because he obviously was the coach here. But he was sort of thrown into this position because of what happened with former coach Ime Udoka. And I think there's been a lot of questions about whether he rose to the occasion.Bustillos: I would say there is that question, are they going to keep him? My question would be, again, to your point, he's learned a lot. He was put in a bad position. Can he learn from these mistakes going forward? And if you go and get a new coach, is that going to fix all your problems? That would be the fourth coach for the Celtics in four years. That's just not something that most franchises that are looking to win a championship would do. They need to find some consistency. Siegel: Esteban, before we officially say goodbye, Nuggets or Heat?Bustillos: Nuggets in six.Alston: And get some dipping sauce.",Local,"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:47:22 EST",773b1ce4b7ae4ac6e3cc32fa6fb8e1cd
1732,Black running groups call for change after police were called to their Boston Marathon cheer section,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/19/black-running-groups-call-for-change-after-police-were-called-to-their-boston-marathon-cheer-section,Newton police on bikes blocked the route after spectators ran on course.,"At mile 21 of the Boston Marathon, the PIONEERS Run Crew and TrailblazHers Run Co. celebrated on Monday as each of their friends running in the race passed by. The two groups, who share a mission of spreading a love of running within communities of color, had set up a tent on Heartbreak Hill in Newton. For hours, they fired confetti cannons and stepped over a rope barrier to run alongside their friends, carrying banners with the running clubs' names.""We were having so much fun,"" said Mike Remy of PIONEERS Run Crew. ""And that all kind of came to an abrupt stop.""Police officers arrived at mile 21 and formed a barrier between the groups and the athletes running past, as well as stood on the street behind the cheer section. Newton Police have characterized the response as a respectful effort to keep runners and spectators safe after receiving complaints, but members of the running clubs say it was heavy-handed, disproportionate to police response elsewhere along the marathon route, and the result of systemic racism. The Boston Athletic Association, which runs the marathon, has agreed to meet with the running groups Wednesday evening to discuss what happened.It's a tradition for the PIONEERS Run Crew to run alongside members who are competing in a marathon, said one of the group's captains, Aliese Lash. ""In Chicago, in D.C., in New York, even in Berlin, we have this sort of moment of tradition of celebration,"" Lash said.Videos from Monday's race in Boston show groups of several spectators from the group running on the marathon with banners. But then, one of the crew leaders was approached by police as he got ready to greet a runner, Lash said.""An officer came up to him and grabbed him and pushed him into the crowd and said, 'Sir, let me see your I.D.,'"" Lash recalled. She said the officer then threatened to arrest the crew leader if he came on the course again. ""And so we said, 'All right, like if we're not allowed to be on the course, we'll just stand behind the line like everyone else,'"" Lash said. ""And then shortly after that, there was a line of bike police who created a barrier between our group and the runners.""Photos and videos of the moment show about a dozen police officers with bikes lined up along Commonwealth Avenue, facing the spectators in the two running clubs, as members of the groups questioned why they're there.Newton Police Chief John Carmichael said in a written statement that the police responded to a complaint from the Boston Athletic Association.""After being notified by the B.A.A three times about spectators traversing the rope barrier and impeding runners, the Newton Police Department responded respectfully and repeatedly requested that spectators stay behind the rope and not encroach onto the course,"" the Newton police chief wrote. ""When spectators continued to cross the rope, NPD with additional officers calmly used bicycles for a short period to demarcate the course and keep both the runners and spectators safe."" When asked for a response to the incident, the Boston Athletic Association released a statement that read, in its entirety, ""The B.A.A. is committed to creating a safe and enjoyable experience for athletes, volunteers and spectators across all our events.”""Our cheer zone was packed with runners and other athletes,"" said Mike Remy of PIONEERS Run Crew. ""So we wouldn't dream of doing something to impede somebody on the course.""For Remy and others in the group, the scene was shaped by its racial dynamics.""All I'm left with is, here is a cheering area primarily of Black and brown and Latin folk, and that's where we are being heavily policed,"" Remy said. ""I didn't see or hear any reports of things like that coming out of Wellesley, coming out of B.C. And having experienced those cheer zones in the past, I know what goes down there. You know, people there are drinking and boozing and real hard. People are crossing the street.""And, he said, people on the sidelines often jump onto the course to run with friends and family who are competing.""If it's going to be a hard and fast rule, then say it's a hard and fast rule, but enforce it everywhere.""For Aliese Lash, there was a clear explanation for what she saw as a disproportionate response.""I mean, my answer is systemic racism,"" Lash said. ""People seeing people who they're not used to showing up in their neighborhoods automatically jumping to biases and assumption that we're unsafe, that we're here to harm somebody, that we're drug dealers — whatever people say or think about when they see us. That is deeply embedded, and that's embedded in our culture, every corner of our culture.""Issues of racism are not new in the running world, Lash said, and the PIONEERS Run Crew exists to help runners of color find a place where they can feel included. Those issues are also why Lash serves on the steering committee for the Boston Running Collaborative, a BAA diversity initiative. ""I'm a part of that group because they're committed to thinking about how we can make running more equitable and accessible to people of color,"" she said. ""And they share stories about how they want us to feel like we belong here, like we're welcome. But I also know that the Boston Marathon itself is a historically exclusive event that is incredibly difficult for people to enter in the first place, [and] that runs through the wealthy white suburbs of the city.

While the war had a profound impact in the United States, it forever altered the lives of millions of Iraqis who were touched by the violence over the ensuing years. Shirin Jaafari, a reporter for GBH and PRX program The World, spoke with Iraqis about how the war shaped their lives and futures. Jaafari joined GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath from Erbil in northern Iraq to share what she learned. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Arun Rath: There were thousands of Americans who lost their lives in Iraq, but hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who died as a result of this war. Tell us about what the feeling is there in general, what you're hearing from Iraqis right now about this anniversary?Shirin Jaafari: You know, there are so many stories here, it's tough to pick just one. It just seems like everyone you talk to has somehow been touched by the war and the violence that came after the U.S.-led invasion. But let me tell you a bit about one woman that I talked to. Her name is Zahraa Malek, and she's 26 years old and she works as an interpreter. I met her at a concert in Baghdad. She told me when she was younger there was a suicide attack at her school — and this was during the sectarian war that erupted in Iraq a few years after the U.S.-led invasion, when the Sunnis and Shias were fighting each other. Zahraa told me that one day a car bomb exploded near her school. She wasn't injured herself, but obviously she was extremely distraught. She said until today, she can't forget the loud bang that she heard that day and as a young kid, she just kept thinking to herself, ""Why? Why is there so much violence? Why are people killing each other?"" And she just couldn't understand why this was happening. She told me one other thing, Arun, and that was what her father said to her. Her father always insisted that the whole family sticks together. They all stay together. They go out together. They stay home together. He said, because if there was an attack, they all die together, so no one would be left behind to carry the pain. This really stayed with me. Rath: It's hard to imagine alternative timelines, but when it comes to the war for Iraqis, is it generally an overall sense of regret, or is it more complicated? Jaafari: You hear a mix of reactions from people. I talked to a lot of young Iraqis and I asked them about how they feel about the U.S. A lot of them were not born during the war or they were too young to remember the details or life under Saddam Hussein. But the Iraqis that I talked to, they say they don't have anything against the U.S. For example, one student told me he doesn't hold any grudges against American troops because they were just following orders. He thinks that it's the politicians who should be held accountable. But I also spoke with Muntazer al-Zaidi. If you remember, he's the Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush at a press conference in 2008. He told me his views about the U.S. haven't changed. He still feels the same. He said, ""How can I forget about what the U.S. did when no one has been held accountable and no one has apologized to the Iraqi people?"" And he told me that Iraq still suffers the consequences of the U.S.-led invasion. So I've been hearing a mix of reactions here. Rath: Iraq does now have a democratic government, at least on paper. It's had its ups and downs, and I guess we can debate how democratic. But tell us about how the country is picking up the pieces now, and how do people think when they're looking to the future? Jaafari: It's funny. When I ask people how they think about the future, they often give me this deep sigh first, as if to say, ""Where do I even start?"" But mainly what I've heard from those that I have talked to is that they have two major concerns: one is jobs and one is security. So Iraq is a very young country. About 40% of its population is under the age of 15. That's out of a population of about 42 million people. And these young Iraqis need jobs. Not everyone has the connections and the means to get a cushy government job, which has sort of been the norm in the past. And the private sector is not as developed as it can be because of the war, because of the corruption and mismanagement. So these young people worry about how they can make a living in this country. When you ask them how they see the future, some of them say, ""I don't want to stay here. I am planning to leave."" And some of them say, ""Well, I don't want to leave, but how can I survive here? Just give me options. Give me alternatives."" And then when you talk about security, Iraq still faces many challenges. Even though ISIS has been defeated, there are still remnants of the group in parts of the country and there is a concern that these groups can make a comeback. Then you have the issue of the powerful militias that have been supported by Iran. They have created some sort of instability in Iraq as well. And Iraqis say they want the government to limit the power that these groups have in Iraq. As I mentioned, there's also the issue of corruption. Iraq is ranked almost at the bottom of the Transparency International's corruption index. Last year, there were reports of a $2.5 billion tax embezzlement case. It was described as the heist of the century, and the money hasn't been returned and the case continues. So, these are the concerns that people have here. When you talk to them about the future, they have doubts, they have concerns, and they really don't know what the future holds for them.",International News,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 15:14:26 EST",14adba230894469125be67b616a0fb55
4989,"In the COVID shutdowns, my family found a lasting silver lining",https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/03/13/in-the-covid-shutdowns-my-family-found-a-lasting-silver-lining,We mark the third anniversary of the stay-at-home orders with a stronger family bond.,"By now my friends know that I am unavailable on Sunday at 11 a.m. I am not going to church, even though that is a typical start time for Christian church services. (As it happens, I’ve been attending Bedside Baptist for a while now, but I digress.) Instead, at 11 a.m. on Sunday I’m firing up my laptop and signing into Google Meet for my weekly family conversation. We started this conversation three years ago when state officials issued orders to shut down all essential businesses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In each of our respective hometowns, my sister, twin niece and nephew and I found ourselves inside looking out. Former Gov. Charlie Baker announced the COVID shutdown in Massachusetts on March 10, 2020. Shutdowns happened 10 days later in New York where my nephew lives, and a week after that, in Minnesota where my niece lives. My sister isolated herself at home unwilling to wait for Tennessee’s official stay-at-home order which didn’t come until April 2.Those early days of uncertainty left us in emotional limbo. We didn’t know when next we would see each other. And while the four of us in my immediate family were accustomed to living apart because of our jobs, the COVID shutdowns had a disquieting effect. We had always kept in close contact with frequent phone calls, texts and emails, but suddenly none of that seemed enough. We needed a more satisfying way to stay in touch. So, like millions of other Americans, we turned to Zoom and other video online calling services. My niece, a full stack web developer, handled the tech, setting up a one-hour Sunday call. But an hour quickly became too short, so we set aside two hours. I can’t tell you how many times friends have exclaimed, “Two hours! What are you all talking about for two hours?” Nothing and everything. We sign on as we are in the moment: my niece generally curled up on her couch under a blanket; my sister off camera yelling that she’ll be with us when she’s done fixing her tea; my nephew, the professional dancer, often bleary eyed from a recent rehearsal or performance; and me plopped on my couch or snuggled down in my big chair. Our conversations are free flowing — they ramble, overlap and punctuate whatever is on our minds — from mundane work stories to hilarious incidents, to somber observations about the state of the world, to Black Twitter’s latest witty posts. Two hours fly by until we reluctantly say goodbye in an outpouring of cascading “Love you” and “See you next Sunday.” Occasionally, each of us has had to call in from another location, or cut the time short, or miss the call altogether. But the conversation has never stopped.Because of the Sunday calls, my family and I really know each other now. We treasure family vacations and other occasions when we are in each other’s company. How lucky that we found a silver lining from a global pandemic which left so many feeling lonely and disconnected. We mark the third anniversary of COVID shutdowns this month grateful for our health and our stronger family bond. Next Sunday morning can’t come soon enough.",Commentary,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 05:00:34 EST",8fb42c3e60c8876519a8082a3df39b74
3034,Women of color are in high-profile positions. Are they getting paid the same?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/16/women-of-color-are-in-high-profile-positions-are-they-getting-paid-the-same,"Eneida Roman, the CEO of Amplify Latinx, discusses pay equity and opportunity gaps.","The latest iteration of The State of Race, a collaboration between GBH, The World, The Boston Globe and the Boston NAACP, will tackle the question: Are women of color on the rise? GBH’s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston be moderating the panel of women leaders making waves and tackling challenges in the realms of health care, academia, business policy and government. One of the panelists, Eneida Román, the CEO of Amplify Latinx, joined Paris to talk ahead of the event. This transcript has been lightly edited. The State of Race: Are Women of Color on the Rise? will be held Thursday at 6 p.m. Free virtual tickets are available. Paris Alston: Thank you so much for joining us. And I want to talk about the event and everything that we're going to discuss. But first, I know that you are new in your role at Amplify Latinx. So tell me how things have been going and what your priorities are. Eneida Román: Thank you so much, Paris. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted to be part of the conversation tonight. As you said, I am new to my role at Amplify as CEO, but I'm not new to Amplify. I'm actually one of the co-founders. It's really delightful for me to see how we've grown and how we've expanded our reach. And so our goal is to actually close those opportunity gaps for Latinos and for women and other people of color through legislation that makes sense, through policy solutions that address these opportunity gaps. Alston: I'm glad you mentioned that, because I know that earlier this week you were at the State House, along with a number of other advocates and policymakers who were pushing for salary transparency bills that would require companies with 15 or more employees in Massachusetts to post their salary ranges and share the salaries of their employees. Tell me a little bit about how that will help level the playing field and what are the disparities that exist currently. Román: That's an excellent question because there is a disparity, despite the fact that we had a wage equity bill passed in the past. This is a little bit different. And I just want to clarify that we can pass these bills without putting an employer at a competitive disadvantage and without burdensome reporting requirements. Because what we're asking is for employers of 100 employees or more to actually share with the state information that they already share with the federal government. The other bill is focused on posting the salary ranges for job openings. And there's at least a dozen other states who are doing this already. So in Massachusetts, we always pride ourselves on being innovative and being ahead of the curve, and being progressive when it comes to equity and inclusion. So this would be another way of ensuring that we are at the top of the game. Alston: You know, it's interesting, Eneida, because I think back to some of my early days and those conversations about salary negotiations were very foreign to me in many ways. I'm curious about your perspective about how that holds women of color back, and why it is important for people to be able to be transparent about these things. Román: Absolutely. You're right, because I think that money tends to be a taboo subject for so many of us, and also negotiating on our behalf. I think as women, we're always taught that we want to take care of others, but we kind of put ourselves in the backseat. And I think that also translates into how we negotiate on behalf of others, but not so much on our behalf. And so it's very interesting how we can distinguish between fairness and deserving something, right? As women, we tend to focus on, ""Well, that's fair."" It's not so much that ""I deserve it."" And I think there's a gender difference there where when a man is talking about his salary, he describes it as him being worthy of it. And so I think it's important that we normalize talking about our worth and about making sure that it's not selfish. It's something that benefits society in general. It benefits all of us because it it improves the GDP of the nation. It improves the economic prosperity of our families and the security of our homes. I think focusing on, normalizing the subject, and not seeing it as the taboo, because that, in fact, is something that really has affected our ability to negotiate on our behalf, on our own progress. Alston: It's interesting that we're going to be tackling this question tonight, as I mentioned: Are women of color on the rise? Because we see them in a number of leadership positions, including the one that you're in. We see them in state and federal government. We see them in higher education and in the business sector, etc., etc. But where do the disparities remain? Román: First of all, the pay equity gap has not improved in 20 years, Right? So that's a reality. That's for women in general. Now, when you look at the pay equity gap for women generally, white women make $0.70 for every dollar their white [male] counterparts make. Now, if we start looking at that, at the numbers, the gap from April until the end of the year, we see that women of color fall even further behind. And so, of course, my focus is on Latinas. And in the work that I do, we see that Latinas literally make half of what their white counterparts make. So they essentially end up working double the time for the same amount of pay. This is due to a number of factors. There's many more Latinas and women of color in entry level positions. So of course the salaries are lower, and so the pathway to the top sometimes has certain obstacles. I think by creating this awareness and by finding policy solutions that help remove the barriers, we clear that path and we remove those roadblocks for women and women of color.",Local,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 13:58:00 EST",3e6be0a644e738940442d26c53c33b9d
5486,What’s at stake in the college affirmative action case before the Supreme Court?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/06/14/whats-at-stake-in-the-college-affirmative-action-case-before-the-supreme-court,A ruling could end 40 years of improved diversity on campuses,"The U.S. Supreme Court is poised to issue a historic ruling this month affecting how colleges consider race in admissions. Here's what you need to know about the decades-long debate over affirmative action and the potential effects of the court's decision.The case could upend 40 years of legal precedent and fundamentally alter the landscape of higher education by making race considerations in college admissions illegal.Decades ago, colleges began considering race as one factor among many in the admissions process as a way to help remediate past discrimination, including the effects of slavery. If the Supreme Court ends affirmative action and colleges curtail the consideration of race as a factor in admission, campuses could become far less racially diverse.In the landmark 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court ruled that racial quotas in admissions were unconstitutional. That decision came after Allan Bakke, a white student, was twice rejected from UC Davis’ medical program, leading him to challenge the constitutionality of its affirmative action program. In his majority decision supporting UC Davis, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, a Virginian nominated by President Richard Nixon, held out Harvard’s admissions program was an example of how race can properly be taken into account in college admissions.""Race is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity, but it is only one factor weighed competitively against a number of other factors deemed relevant,” Powell wrote. “Under such a system, each applicant is treated as an individual regardless of race and is considered in competition for each seat in the class.""Nine years ago, a group called Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard University. Led by Edward Blum, a conservative legal strategist and longtime critic of race-based admissions, the group claimed Harvard held Asian-American applicants to higher academic and personal standards in the admissions process.Harvard denied those charges, arguing that race is just one factor in its admissions criteria. Harvard also noted that its population of Asian-American students doubled from 15 to 30 percent in the last 20 years. No Asian American applicants took the stand to testify that they were denied admission to Harvard because of their race. The plaintiffs relied on statistical analysis and administrative notes in the margins that they claimed exhibited implicit bias.In 2019, a federal judge in Boston ruled that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants. Students For Fair Admissions disagreed. The group appealed the judge’s ruling and filed another lawsuit against the University of North Carolina. Those complaints have reached the Supreme Court.Last October, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and members of the majority conservative court asked questions from the bench that were deeply skeptical of the educational value of racial diversity. Many experts now predict the court will strike down race-conscious admissions.Thomas is expected to issue the majority opinion on the case, which ironically benefitted students like him in the 1960s. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester through a program designed to make the campus more racially diverse.In his 2008 memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" Thomas said he felt stigmatized by affirmative action because his classmates at Holy Cross and later at Yale Law School viewed him as a beneficiary of the program and not as an accomplished student.Nine states already have bans against race-conscious college admissions: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington. Those states have seen a growing gap between the percentage of Black, Hispanic and Native American high school graduates compared to the percentage of those students enrolled in large public universities.After California voters enacted a statewide ban in 1996, Black enrollment at the University of California's most selective schools dropped dramatically. At U.C.L.A., the percentage of Black students fell by more than half, from 7% to about 4% within two years. Colleges have said they will continue their efforts to admit a racially diverse student body and even boost their recruitment efforts. Some civil rights activists have said that’s not enough, and have proposed adopting slave descent as a factor in admissions.Such an approach is akin to “legacy admissions,” under which the children of alumni get prioritized in admissions, advocates have said. “Affirmative action, when it started, was aimed at addressing and remedying the history of discrimination against Black Americans and trying to open up opportunities for them,” said Ted Shaw, director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina. “It would be correct to return to the roots of these efforts.""Critics have questioned that approach, saying it would leave out other marginalized racial and ethnic groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans who could be affected by a potential ban.",Education,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 05:00:57 EST",41dd1045673074271a00f6a1ba205ed3

Mike Connolly, D-Cambridge, announced Monday that he's leaving the Boston chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America after the group moved to expel him for, among other things, endorsing Maura Healey in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary and twice supporting Ron Mariano for speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.Connolly, who had initially vowed to fight the proposed expulsion, told GBH News Monday that his thinking shifted over the course of several days.""It really became clear that the fundamental charge was that I was building partnerships and working with other state leaders and activists to deliver results for our communities,"" Connolly added. ""I don't think building broad coalitions in support of our goals is an abandonment of our values. I think it's actually necessary for delivering for people in need.""By way of example, Connolly cited his recent push to reverse the planned closure of the MBTA's Union Square station for several weeks this summer. The Healey Administration backtracked on that plan less than a week after it was announced.In 2022, Connolly's endorsement of Healey came about three weeks before then state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz, who was challenging Healey from the left, ended her campaign.Mariano, who has twice been elected House speaker, has shown both centrist and progressive tendencies in that role. In the most recent legislative session, for example, he backed a business-friendly tax cut plan, while also championing a new law that lets undocumented immigrants obtain driver's licenses.As it moved to expel Connolly, Boston DSA also cited Connolly's collaboration with sympathetic landlords as he advocates for rent control on Beacon Hill. The Democratic Socialists of America website describes capitalism as a fundamentally exploitative system, and endorses collective ownership of ""key economic drivers"" like transportation and energy production.""What was so clarifying for me over the past week was how many people ... reached out and said, 'We love what you're doing and we hope you continue to do it,'"" Connolly said. ""So it reached a point where, for me, I felt what was most important was to focus on doing the work with good-faith partners.""Connolly, who took office in 2017, is widely regarded as one of the most left-leaning legislators on Beacon Hill. After the 2021-2022 legislative session concluded, he was one of three state representatives honored by the group Progressive Mass, which gave him an A+ for his voting record.His break with Boston DSA means that just one other state legislator, state Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, D-Somerville, is affiliated with the group.On Monday afternoon, the Boston DSA's coordinating committee released a statement saying there would no longer be a vote on Connolly's proposed expulsion, and stressing that the committee as a whole had not endorsed his removal before he announced his exit.This story was updated to include the Boston DSA's statement.",Politics,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 13:49:03 EST",248a37782cd76ebcf356c03526ee351c

Maura Healey has named Edward Augustus as state housing secretary, according to a source familiar with the process, turning to a former state senator and Worcester city manager to serve as point person on one of her top priorities.The governor created the position earlier this year after she promised to make housing a priority on the campaign trail.In striving to boost housing production, Augustus will face the same challenges as others before him: addressing local resistance to growth, navigating zoning bylaws and ordinances that vary from community to community, and working with the Legislature to enact new housing policies.Healey pledged last fall to split the housing and economic development secretariat into two if she were elected, and the administration has often pointed to the housing secretary position as critical to efforts to addresss the housing affordability and availability crisis across the state.""We think it's certainly going to be a chief reason we're going to be able to meet or hopefully close the gap on the 200,000 housing units that we are short in Massachusetts,"" Lt. Gov. Driscoll said about the position in February.Augustus left his post as a chancellor at Dean College in Franklin last month, saying at the time that he was ""not sure where life's journey will take me next,"" MassLive reported.Before his stint at Dean College in Franklin, where he worked for less than a year, Augustus roamed the halls of both Worcester City Hall and the State House. He served as Worcester city manager for eight years, from 2013 through mid-2022, his LinkedIn says.Over his eight years as city manager, he oversaw over $90 million in renovations to the city's public parks and led a downtown resurgence effort, according to a release from Dean College, from when the college named Augustus chancellor.Augustus represented Worcester's 2nd District in the Senate for two terms, from 2005 until 2008 where he chaired the Committee on Bills in the Third Reading and Joint Committee on Election Laws, and vice-chaired the committees on education, veterans and federal affairs, and public service. He won his Senate seat in 2004 by defeating GOP candidate Robi Blute to fill Guy Glodis' former seat in the Senate.He was Congressman Jim McGovern's chief of staff, worked in former President Bill Clinton's U.S. Department of Education, and served as director of government and community relations for the College of the Holy Cross, the Dean College release says.The Healey plan to split the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development into two separate offices, an Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities and an Executive Office of Economic Development, will take effect on May 30.[Michael P.

2834,Carrie Moore looks to guide Harvard women's basketball to new destinations,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/10/carrie-moore-looks-to-guide-harvard-womens-basketball-to-new-destinations,Moore took over for longtime head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith last year,"For most basketball teams, success begins on the hardwood. For Harvard women’s basketball this year, it may have started on the Charles River. Last fall, after a pre-season practice had wrapped up, first-year head coach Carrie Moore took her team out with Harvard women’s lightweight rowing team to get a taste of navigating as a team on the water. Unfortunately, the conditions weren’t the best. “It was, like, freezing and raining and we had just had practice and [Moore was] like, ‘All right, let’s go, let’s go to the river!’” said senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy, who had never been rowing before. Moore — who herself had also never rowed before — admits that she was scared. But the rowers, who were sprinkled among the basketball players in the boats, assured them that the odds of tipping over were low. After that, the reason for the trip started to come through. “I think you learn a lot on the boat,” Moore said. “Just in terms of it’s not an individual sport by any means. If one person is off at all in terms of their technique, the boat is shifting left or right. The balance has to be perfect.”It’s not the typical exercise for a basketball program that for 40 seasons was led by Kathy Delaney-Smith, after whom the head coaching position at Harvard is named. But in her first year as skipper, Moore has steered the Crimson’s ship to the Ivy League tournament with a 16-10 record in her first year, two wins away from an automatic berth in the NCAA tourney. For Moore, it’s all part of the plan as she aims to keep Harvard on the course Delaney-Smith set — and even go beyond. It would be natural for just about anyone to be intimidated when trying to fill the big shoes of Delaney-Smith. Over her four decades at Harvard, she racked up 630 wins, winning nearly 70% of her games in the Ivy League along the way. But for Moore, who came to Harvard from the University of Michigan, that torch wasn’t a burden. “I don’t know if I necessarily have ever felt it as pressure,” Moore said. “I think, if anything, I just see it as a tremendous opportunity. Because she proved that you can win at a very high level here. Which means that it’s possible for us to do what we want to do.”For players like senior guard and captain McKenzie Forbes, one of the things that helped with the transition is that Moore made a lasting first impression.“I feel like the person we got that day is like the same Coach Moore that we have to this day, and I think everyone can appreciate that,” Forbes said. “And like feel that when you’re meeting someone new, you can kind of like get that vibe of like, ‘OK, what kind of person are they?’ And I think she’s very authentic, very genuine with us.”On the court, the seeds of that authenticity are on full display. During the regular season finale against Dartmouth at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion, Moore roamed the sidelines, her hands in her pockets, picking up every little detail and pulling players to the side for quick conversations the moment they stepped off the court.Even though the Big Green hadn’t won an Ivy League game all year, Moore coached with the focus you'd expect of someone in the Final Four. Harvard would go on to win in a 64-40 route. It’s the kind of attention to detail that Harvard will need as it heads into the Ivy League Tournament. But Moore’s core mantra of “Believe It” has the team feeling like they can run the table even as they face Columbia, the only Ivy League team Harvard hasn’t beaten this year.“This whole season, we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and changing of the lineups with different injuries, different players being out. But she’s always like, ‘Believe It,’” McCarthy said with a snap of her finger. “All we have is all we need,” Forbes added. Over the course of the season, Moore’s learned a lot. One of the main lessons she’s come to understand is just how much patience the profession requires. She wants to hang banners and doesn’t want to settle for being third or fourth in the conference. She wants to recruit players who can change the trajectory of the program, and she hopes to make them into better people and players. Moore knows that’s coming. But if basketball is anything like rowing down a river, then even the best coaches have to get used to the water first.“I’m a Taurus and I’m extremely stubborn. And it’s incredibly hard for me to not have it all right now,” Moore said. “But I think I’ve learned that the lessons and the enjoyment is in the journey, not necessarily the destination. But we’ll get there.”",Local,"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 05:00:11 EST",4909949373ed4269ec62aacbef8f6f2e

But is the hype overblown?","From reading emails to personalizing social media feeds and analyzing data, artificial intelligence is already a part of our everyday lives. But as the technology progresses at an accelerated rate, many industry leaders have become concerned that it’s moving too fast, with some top U.S. officials promising a multinational approach to regulation. Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at MIT, told Greater Boston that instead of worrying about AI causing humankind's downfall, we should focus on more immediate threats.“It [human extinction] exaggerates the capabilities of the current technologies,” said Acemoglu, “and makes us shift the focus from the more mundane damage that these new models are likely to cause in terms of misinformation, job displacement, democratic threats and all sorts of small things that are going to be part of our lives if rolled out in an uncontrolled and unregulated manner.”AI hype excites investors while worrying tech competitors. Aleksander Mądry, the director of MIT’s Center for Deployable Machine Learning, said this hype alternates between optimism about what AI can do and its existential risks, without discussing how to regulate and integrate AI into our daily lives.“With much of our society driven by informational spaces — in particular social media and online media in general — AI and, in particular, generative AI accelerates a lot of problems like misinformation, spam, spear phishing and blackmail,” said Mądry. The fact AI technology touches on every aspect of society makes regulation that much trickier.“I think we should think of reforms of the AI community more broadly so that AI researchers actually work in using these technologies in human-friendly ways, trying to make humans more empowered and more productive,” said Acemoglu.",Science and Technology,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 12:10:26 EST",cdce4bbed4ae5a45f6b9bf5e9a41cf6d
5387,No decision whether guardsman accused of leaks to be held,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/27/teixeira-spoke-of-murder-and-may-still-possess-military-secrets-prosecutors-say,The judge put off an immediate decision on whether to keep Jack Teixeira in custody.,"Updated April 27 at 3:28 p.m.WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) — The Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents kept an arsenal of guns and said on social media that he would like to kill a “ton of people,” prosecutors said in arguing Thursday that 21-year-old Jack Teixeira should remain in jail for his trial.But the judge at Teixeira's detention hearing put off an immediate decision whether he should be kept in custody until his trial or released to home confinement or under other conditions. Teixeira was led away from the court in handcuffs, black rosary beads around his neck, pending that ruling.The court filings raise new questions about why Teixeira had such a high security clearance and access to some of the nation's most classified secrets. They said he may still have material that hasn't been released, which could be of “tremendous value to hostile nation states that could offer him safe harbor and attempt to facilitate his escape from the United States.”In Teixeira's detention hearing, Magistrate Judge David Hennessy expressed skepticism of defense arguments that the government hasn't shown Teixeira ever intended leaked information to be widely disseminated.“Somebody under the age of 30 has no idea that when they put something on the internet that it could end up anywhere in this world?” the judge asked. “Seriously?”Teixeira entered his hearing in Worcester in orange prison garb, smiling at his father in the front row. His handcuffs were removed before he sat down and put back on when he was taken out.One possibility is that the judge could order Teixeira to be confined at his father’s home while awaiting trial, if not held in jail. Under questioning at the hearing, his father, Jack Michael Teixeira, said he was aware that if his son were to violate conditions of release or home confinement, he’d have to report him. The elder Teixeira said he owns firearms but no longer has any in his home.""You have a young man before you who didn’t flee, has nowhere to flee,” said Brendan Kelley, the defendant's lawyer. “He will answer the charges, he will be judged by his fellow citizens”But Nadine Pellegrini, chief of national security division in the Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office, told the judge the information prosecutors submitted to the court about the defendant's threatening words and behavior “is not speculation, it is not hyperbole, nor is it the creation of a caricature. It is based on what we know to date ... directly based upon the words and actions of this defendant.”The prosecution's filing contains a review of what it says are Teixeira social media posts, stating in November that he would “kill a (expletive) ton of people” if he had his way, because it would be “culling the weak minded.”Late Wednesday, the Air Force announced it suspended the commander of the 102nd Intelligence Support Squadron where Teixeira worked and the administrative commander “overseeing the support for the unit mobilized under federal orders,” pending further investigation. It also temporarily removed each leader’s access to classified systems and information.Court papers urging a federal judge to keep Teixeira in custody detailed a troubling history going back to high school, where he was suspended when a classmate overheard him discussing Molotov cocktails and other weapons as well as racial threats. More recently, prosecutors said, he used his government computer to research past mass shootings and standoffs with federal agents.He remains a grave threat to national security and a flight risk, prosecutors wrote, and investigators are still trying to determine whether he kept any physical or digital copies of classified information, including files that haven’t already surfaced publicly.“There simply is no condition or combination of conditions that can ensure the Defendant will not further disclose additional information still in his knowledge or possession,” prosecutors wrote. “The damage the Defendant has already caused to the U.S. national security is immense. The damage the Defendant is still capable of causing is extraordinary.”Teixeira has been in jail since his arrest earlier this month on charges stemming from the greatest known intelligence leak in years.Teixeira has been charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. He has not yet entered a plea.His lawyers are urging the judge to release him from jail, arguing in court papers filed Thursday that appropriate conditions can be set even if the court finds him to be a flight risk — such as confinement at his father's home and location monitoring.The defense said Teixeira no longer has access to any top-secret information and accused prosecutors of providing “little more than speculation that a foreign adversary will seduce Mr. Teixeira and orchestrate his clandestine escape from the United States.”“The government’s allegations ... offer no support that Mr. Teixeira currently, or ever, intended any information purportedly to the private social media server to be widely disseminated,” they wrote. “Thus, its argument that Mr. Teixeira will continue to release information or destroy evidence if not detained rings hollow.”Prosecutors wrote in their filing that he kept his gun locker within reach of his bed and in it were handguns, bolt-action rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon, and a gas mask.They said FBI special agents also found ammunition and tactical pouches on his dresser, what appeared to be a silencer-style accessory in his desk drawer and a military-style helmet in the dumpster with a mounting bracket such as that used for a camera.He is accused of distributing highly classified documents about top national security issues in a chat room on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers. The leak stunned military officials, sparked an international uproar and raised fresh questions about America’s ability to safeguard its secrets.The leaked documents appear to detail U.S. and NATO aid to Ukraine and U.S. intelligence assessments regarding U.S. allies that could strain ties with those nations. Some show real-time details from February and March of Ukraine’s and Russia’s battlefield positions and precise numbers of battlefield gear lost and newly flowing into Ukraine from its allies.Prosecutors wrote that Teixeira, who owned multiple guns, repeatedly had “detailed and troubling discussions about violence and murder” on the platform where authorities say he shared the documents. In February, he told another person that he was tempted to make a minivan into an “assassination van,"" prosecutors wrote.The Justice Department's filing outlines a pattern of troubling behavior that officials say began well before he entered the military and continued in recent months, even as his position afforded him access to government secrets.In 2018, prosecutors allege, Teixeira was suspended after a classmate “overheard him make remarks about weapons, including Molotov cocktails, guns at the school, and racial threats."" His initial application for a firearms identification card that same year was denied due to police department concerns over those remarks.He applied again over the next two years, and cited in his 2020 application after joining the Guard “his position of trust in the United States government as a reason he could be trusted to possess a firearm,” prosecutors wrote.The Justice Department said that it has also learned through its investigation that Teixeira in July used his government computer to look up a series of U.S. mass shootings and government standoffs, including the terms “Ruby Ridge,” “Las Vegas shooting,” “Mandalay Bay shooting,” “Uvalde” and “Buffalo tops shooting” — an apparent reference to the 2022 racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket.The searches of mass shootings on a government computer should have triggered the computer to generate an immediate referral to security, which could have then led to a more in-depth review of Teixeira’s file, according to Dan Meyer, a lawyer who specializes in military, federal employment and security clearance issues. The Air Force’s investigation will probably discover whether a referral was generated — and whether security officers did anything with the information.Teixeira’s lawyers noted that he has no criminal history and would have no access to guns if he was released. The incident at his high school was “thoroughly investigated” and he was allowed to come back after a few days and a professional psychological evaluation, they wrote. That investigation was “fully known and vetted ” by the Air National Guard before he enlisted and when he obtained his top secret security clearance, they said.Months later, after news outlets began reporting on the documents leak, Teixeira took steps to destroy evidence after news outlets began reporting on the documents leak. Authorities who searched a dumpster at his home found a smashed laptop, tablet and Xbox gaming console, they said.Authorities have not alleged a motive. Members of the Discord group have described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S. military operations or to influence American policy.Billing records the FBI obtained from Discord were among the things that led authorities to Teixeira, who enlisted in the Air National Guard in September 2019. A Discord user told the FBI that a username linked to Teixeira began posting what appeared to be classified information roughly in December.Teixeira was detected on April 6 — the day The New York Times first published a story about the breach of documents — searching for the word “leak” in a classified system, according to court papers. The FBI says that was reason to believe Teixeira was trying to find information about the investigation into who was responsible for the leaks.____Tucker and Copp reported from Washington.",Local,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 09:30:32 EST",fd7e0db5906701f578508f6b5ebd4c90

That's when a group of white nationalists carrying torches marched through the campus of the University of Virginia, some chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""Commonwealth's Attorney James Hingeley did not say in the release how many people have been indicted and did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment on Tuesday. According to electronic court records, the indictments against three people have been unsealed, including William Zachary Smith, of Nacona, Texas; Tyler Bradley Dykes, of Bluffton, South Carolina; and Dallas Medina, of Ravenna, Ohio.Each is charged with a single count of burning an object with the intent of intimidating a person or group of people. The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison.Smith's attorney, Cody Villalon, declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday. Dykes and Medina do not have the name of any attorneys listed in electronic court records.The indictments, which were issued in February but only recently unsealed, come almost six years after violence broke out during two days of demonstrations by the largest gathering of white nationalists in a decade.Clashes began on the night of Aug. 11, 2017, during the torch march, and continued the following day, when a ""Unite the Right"" rally was planned. James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes.Prosecutors said the indictments were issued ""as part of a criminal investigation that is active and ongoing,"" adding they work with law enforcement to investigate, analyze applicable laws, and bring charges ""when appropriate.""""This is our process regardless of how much time has passed or where the alleged offenders may be found,"" they said.Former President Donald Trump set off a firestorm of criticism when he said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the clashes between white nationalists and anti-racist demonstrators in Charlottesville.

3561,Online sports betting starts with a bang,https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2023/04/20/online-sports-betting-starts-with-a-bang,Big March returns could bring on more regulatory scrutiny.,"Last year, as the debate over legalizing sports betting played out on Beacon Hill, it was tempting to ask why that particular topic was commanding so much attention while other priorities receded into the background or failed to gain traction at all. This week, new data from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission gave us the answer. Interest in sports betting is intense, especially when you can do it from your phone — which makes it a huge moneymaker for the parties involved. In March, the first month in which online sports betting was legal in the state, license holders received and settled about $570 million in wagers. The vast majority of those — nearly $550 million — were placed online, compared to just $20 million wagered in person. Before legal sports betting became a reality, proponents pointed out that most of New England had already embraced the industry. They also noted that taxes on sports betting would bolster Massachusetts' coffers — and sure enough, it brought in more than $9 million in taxes last month. However, that public benefit came with a much bigger private cost. The state's online sports betting license holders made just over $48 million in March — money that used to belong to Massachusetts residents.Is that tradeoff worth it? The answer depends, in part, on whether you see sports betting participants as rational actors having a bit of fun, or as easy marks being manipulated by a fundamentally predatory industry.It also depends on what happens next. Online sports betting's fast start reflects, at least in part, aggressive promotions in which free ""bonus bets"" were awarded to players following a low-stakes initial wager — on DraftKings, for a time, a $5 wager automatically gave bettors another $200 to gamble with. (A gaming commission spokesperson said those free bets are included in the March tally, but couldn't say what their total value was.) It may also have been driven the sheer novelty of the industry and the NCAA basketball tournaments’ March Madness, which has prompted low-stakes wagering by coworkers and friends for decades. If March was an anomaly, the outflow of cash from Massachusetts residents to sports betting operators will likely diminish as time goes on. (Before sports betting became legal, estimated tax revenues tended to top out at $60 million annually.) Then again, those big March numbers could be an early sign that, for whatever reason, the residents of Massachusetts are more willing to bet big, and lose big, on sports than anyone anticipated. If so, could state lawmakers be forced to rein in the same industry they just chose to create? Given House Speaker Ron Mariano's oft-stated support for sports betting, it's hard to imagine the Legislature doing anything that would significantly limit the industry's ability to operate and make a (taxable) profit. Even so, ramped-up scrutiny could be coming in the next few months. Attorney General Andrea Campbell identifies herself as a supporter of responsible sports betting. Still, even before the March returns were in, she successfully pushed the gaming commission to tighten restrictions on the industry’s advertising practices. Among other things, it now requires that operators avoid advertising to individuals under 21 years old, and also that they provide easy ways to opt out of marketing efforts. As more information is collected, including who’s placing bets and whether reports of problem gambling are proliferating, Campbell and other watchdogs may find new reasons to push for heightened regulation. In the meantime, all the money being spent on online sports betting will likely ramp up pressure on state lawmakers to let the Massachusetts Lottery sell its products online, too. That shift, which is backed by state Treasurer Deborah Goldberg and House lawmakers, has a new supporter in Gov. Maura Healey, who recently told GBH News’ Boston Public Radio that Massachusetts has “a lottery system that right now isn’t able to compete. ... The [state] lottery, that’s money coming back to cities and towns.” Of course, before that lottery money went back to cities and towns, it belonged to Massachusetts residents who chose to gamble it away. But right now, any discomfort with the state facilitating that choice seems to have faded.",Commentary,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 08:00:34 EST",fb3ee822f4e2bd0094e0bb0c93098a2a

Sure, you’ve banned books by Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation. The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.” As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — because today is rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl, both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans. My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstar LeBron James toppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history.",Commentary,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 05:00:53 EST",56c163d7bc89c1725e2c1a6f2fa9dcfd
3143,Dave Epstein forecast: An intense storm with shifting variables,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/13/dave-epstein-forecast-an-intense-storm-with-shifting-variables,Snow will arrive in Boston Tuesday afternoon.,"An intense storm is going to affect Southern New England beginning overnight and continuing through Tuesday night. This storm will bring strong coastal wind, which will penetrate to a lesser extent inland, and heavy torrential rain with an eventual change to heavy snow. The timing of that change from rain to snow will drastically affect how much snow accumulates.The winds will arrive Monday evening and strengthen overnight. By Tuesday morning, the wind will be gusting along the coastline. At times during Tuesday, it could be as high as 50 to 60 miles an hour right along the water's edge. These strong winds may produce some power outages. Those winds will subside toward Wednesday morning has that part of the storm dissipates.Precipitation will come down very hard Tuesday morning and afternoon. For most of us it'll be in the form of rain to start, but changing over to snow from Northern Worcester County and then headed toward Boston for the early afternoon. The exact time of the changeover from rain to snow will be critical to how much snow you receive. There will be bands of heavy rain and snow rotating around the system during the afternoon. If the changeover occurs as these bands come through, you could expect one to two inches of snow in an hour. However if the change is delayed in your area, that precipitation will simply fall as heavy rain.This is why the gradient between a little snow and a lot of snow is so tight. This is the most difficult part of the storm: A difference in one or two degrees can mean a couple of inches of snow or over half a foot. The computer guidance we all use to help us forecast is good, but it has a hard time with such volatile and marginal situations.I think the heaviest bands of snow will be over between 6 and 8 p.m., but there can be lingering snow showers, some of which could be briefly heavy right through the early morning hours. Travel is not recommended Tuesday afternoon once the change occurs. You will not want to be caught on the roads as conditions will rapidly change, and visibility in some areas could be near zero for a while. It wouldn't surprise me if we even heard the rumble of thunder.Tides are astronomically low right now, so I'm not terribly concerned about coastal flooding. The wind and wave action could produce some beach erosion but other than the strong winds at the coast, we're not going to see flooding like we can in some of these nor'easters.Heavy, wet snow alone can create power outages, as can strong wind. Some areas will see both of these combined. This means there will be power outages in increasing frequency during Tuesday and lasting into early Wednesday before the numbers start coming down.Clearing and mild air conditions will take place for Thursday with melting snow and a return to normal conditions.",Local,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 14:17:51 EST",a4b75fa383dd4b680a9eb9ce3b2d8cf3

About 75% of the nation's emergency departments report into the program. Some recent spikes in heat-related illnessThis summer, hospitals recorded a large spike in heat-related illness in the region that includes Texas as well as Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma. According to the CDC analysis, for several days in June, the rates of emergency department visits for heat-related illness were the highest seen in this region in the past five years. Parts of the region saw above-average temperatures last month. According to the Texas Tribune, a mid-month heat wave brought ""an unusually high number of 100-degree days.""Record high rates of heat-related illness showed up early in the year in several other regions. Federal health regions 1, 2, 5 and 8, which includes the Northeast, the upper Midwest and the Rocky Mountain region, saw the highest daily rates of heat-related illness recorded in any April over the past five years. And region 10, which includes the Pacific Northwest and Idaho, saw the same trend of record-setting daily heat-related hospital visits for the months of both April and May.In 2021, that region also saw the highest recorded rate of heat-related illness in any region since 2018, when much higher-than-average temperatures scorched a region that doesn't traditionally deal with heat, and where air conditioning use isn't widespread.""There's a lot of regional variation in what temperatures trigger a heat-related illness spike, based on what people are acclimated to, what their infrastructure is built for,"" Brown says.Heat-related deaths are risingCDC's Brown notes that extreme summer heat is increasing in the U.S. ""It's hot again, and it's getting hotter every summer,"" she says. ""Climate projections indicate that extreme heat events will be more frequent and intense in coming decades as well.""And she says, despite some improvements in forecasting, public messaging and access to air conditioning, ""extreme heat events remain a cause of preventable deaths nationwide.""She cites the increase in heat-related deaths in 2020, 2021 and 2022, as tracked by the National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC warns that anyone spending time in the heat should take precautions. Heat-related illness may start as a rash, headache, dizziness or nausea, but can quickly escalate. Heat stroke, or hyperthermia, happens when the body loses the ability to regulate temperature. While it often develops as a bad turn from heat cramps or heat exhaustion, ""it can also strike suddenly, without prior symptoms,"" Brown says. Those with heat stroke might feel confused or dizzy, and may or may not be sweating. If someone feels these symptoms or suspects heat stroke for any reason, Brown advises you call 911 immediately. Those who are more vulnerable to heat-related illness include pregnant people, those with lung conditions, young children and the elderly. Outdoor labor and sports can contribute. For instance, in Austin, Texas, a large share of their emergency visits are coming from young men overexerting themselves in the heat, according to CBS Austin. Living in cities surrounded by pavement and little shade also increases the ambient heat levels. The CDC is working with cities on preparing for more extreme weather, expected to get worse in the coming decades due to climate change. They hope that better planning and public awareness, as well as more air conditioning, can help protect people from the consequences of heat.

Kalb, the CEO and co-founder of Seattle-based food management startup Shelf Engine, had been following news of a bank run at Silicon Valley Bank, with droves attempting to pull out $42 billion from the bank on Thursday alone on fears that it was teetering on the brink. The bank was was on firm financial footing on Wednesday. The following day, it was under water. For Shelf Engine, a 40-person startup founded in 2015 that uses artificial intelligence to help grocery stores reduce food waste, this was a major problem.Not only did Silicon Valley Bank help the company process checks and payments, but all of the startup's cash was locked up in the bank. Kalb sprung into action. He and his team quickly opened an account at JPMorgan Chase and attempted to wire transfer every last penny out of Silicon Valley Bank.""Unfortunately, our wire was not honored and our money is still at Silicon Valley Bank,"" Kalb, 37, said in an interview on Friday. ""We woke up this morning hoping the money would be in that JPMorgan bank account, and it was not."" While he declined to provide the exact amount, he noted that Shelf Engine has raised more than $60 million from investors. ""It was a very large sum of money,"" he said of the transfer. It is a nail-biting limbo state that many tech startups deeply entrenched in Silicon Valley Bank are now facing in the wake of the bank's implosion, the largest American bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. For tech startups, which for decades have relied heavily on the bank based in Santa Clara, Calif., it has set off a crisis that could lead to mass layoffs, or hundreds of startups collapsing, according to industry insiders. ""If the government doesn't step in, I think a whole generation of startups will be wiped off the planet,"" Garry Tan, president and CEO of the startup incubator Y Combinator, said in an interview. An 'existential risk' to innovation and competition in America Founded over a poker game in 1983, Silicon Valley Bank became the go-to lender for tech startups that appeared too risky in the eyes of larger, more traditional banks. Eventually, Silicon Valley Bank would come to do business with nearly half of all U.S. tech startups backed by venture capitalists. ""If you're a high-growth startup, you can't get a credit card from a normal credit card provider, you can't get a loan from a big bank, but Silicon Valley Bank would give you that,"" Shelf Engine's Kalb said. ""It's these services that startups couldn't get elsewhere."" Silicon Valley Bank did business with well-known tech companies including Shopify, Pinterest, Fitbit and thousands of lesser-known startups, in addition to established venture capital firms, like Andreessen Horowitz. Roku, the TV streaming provider, was among the companies caught in the middle to the tune of $487 million, it said in a regulator filing on Friday. ""At this time, the company does not know to what extent the company will be able to recover its cash on deposit at SVB,"" officials at Roku wrote of what amounts to about 26% of the company's cash.Tan, with Y Combinator, which helped launch startups including Airbnb, Reddit and Instacart, said the biggest threat right now is not to the Rokus of the world, but rather to the scrappy startups that were already fighting to stay alive amid a challenging fundraising environment.Founders have been texting him nonstop since Silicon Valley Bank failed with a sense of dread and fear — and increasingly confronting what could be the end of their companies. ""Founders are texting me now and saying they don't know how to make payroll next week. Will they have to take out personal loans to keep the business running? Do they have to furlough workers?"" Tan said. ""This can be an existential risk to competition and innovation in the American economy for the next decade."" While most banking experts do not expect the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank's collapse to spread to other parts of the financial world, how much money depositors will be able to recoup remains an open question. Silicon Valley Bank failure comes amid 'challenging' time for startups The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said that depositors will be able to access up to $250,000 of their funds by Monday morning. Any amount above that will result in a ""receivership certificate."" And when the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, those with certificates will receive payments — but how long that will take, and what amount of money will be paid back, remains unclear. Some estimates suggest that as little as about 3% of the bank's deposits are below $250,000, meaning the vast bulk of depositors have money that exceeds standard federal insurance. Kalb said he is exploring debt financing, or other lines of credit, in order to survive. Securing $250,000 from the FDIC would allow the startup to stay open for an additional several days, but not much longer.He just paid his employees this week, and his next payroll deadline is March 20.""If we don't have access to capital by then, we're going to have to make some very difficult decisions,"" he said.The meltdown of one of Silicon Valley's cornerstone financial institutions could not have come at a worst time for the startup ecosystem, said Tan of Y Combinator. High interest rates and market uncertainty has made lenders tighten the spigot on money, after many years of low interest rates and easy money sent valuations soaring. Lately, entrepreneurs have been raising alarms about existing cash quickly evaporating, forcing thousands of startups to lay off workers or shutter altogether. Into those bruising conditions comes the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, considered a financial pillar of the startup world. ""Venture capital funding had already been in a contraction mode,"" Tan said. ""So this is really a challenging time for something so devastating to happen.""

5262,"A repurposed school bus is bringing arts, tech programs to underserved youth in Worcester",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/08/08/a-repurposed-school-bus-is-bringing-arts-tech-programs-to-underserved-youth-in-worcester,The converted school bus previously sat idle in need of repairs.,"A year ago, a school bus redesigned into a mobile classroom for children sat rusting in a Worcester parking lot. The colorful murals of math equations and planets painted on the outside of the bus were peeling off from the sun and rain. The engine needed a tune-up. Judy Perry planned to use the bus for her Worcester nonprofit, the Jubilee Career Center for Performing Arts, which provides free arts and technology programming to underprivileged youth. But since accepting the bus as a gift in 2015, Perry struggled to cover the cost of insuring and operating it.Philanthropic organizations continued to deny her grant money — like other Worcester nonprofit leaders of color. That systemic barrier, which has played out across the country, forced Perry to rely on her own pocketbook just to keep Jubilee afloat. But she still didn’t have enough money to fix up the bus, let alone operate it.In a dramatic turnaround, that’s all changed, and she’s experienced a surge in donations and grants in the past eight months. The bus — with its computers, desks and cabinets — is finally living up to Perry’s hopes: on any given day, it’s in an underserved Worcester community hosting instructors who teach children about everything from fashion design to being respectful on social media. “Hallelujah hallelujah,” Perry said one recent afternoon as elementary-school aged kids from Worcester’s Great Brook Valley public housing community learned how to use sewing machines and electronic sketch pads aboard the bus. “It’s just amazing because we’ve waited for so long.” Perry noted that many lower-income Worcester families can’t afford to buy computers and pay for wifi, a problem highlighted during the pandemic when schools transitioned to remote learning. Children may be talented, Perry said, but they need resources and opportunities to reach their potential and blossom. The bus is meant to help provide that. “The goal and the purpose was to always go to the different communities, let the kids come on the bus, enjoy the arts and technology, have fun and learn,” she said. “Just to open somebody's eyes and let them know that there's something beyond what they see in their environment.” Perry’s experience growing up in Providence has shaped her goals for the mobile technology bus. Before starting her nonprofit, Perry loved to dance and at one point had a free scholarship to practice ballet in high school. But once the scholarship ended, Perry couldn’t afford the training to continue pursuing dance as a career. “I had to give up,” she said. “That just got me thinking about young people of color who … will never be exposed to the arts. They'll never be exposed to technology.” Despite that ambition, Perry said her plans for the bus were in serious jeopardy late last year. People began questioning her about why she wasn’t taking advantage of the bus. “One person, and it broke my heart, they went as far as to put on Facebook, how the bus was sitting, peeling and not doing anything. And they wanted me to sell them the bus. It's like they criticized me,” Perry said. “I'm like, ‘OK, but how are you helping us out? You know, are you able to give us funding?’”Perry said her luck started to change shortly after GBH News highlighted the bus in a story late last year about nonprofit funding disparities in Worcester. In January, Perry received an anonymous $25,000 donation that helped cover the cost of repairing the bus’ engine and generator that powers its air-conditioning units. Perry also used the money to purchase electronic sketch pads for the mobile classroom and renew its insurance policy. More funding came in June when Perry received a $5,000 grant from the Worcester Arts Council, a municipal body that funds arts initiatives around Worcester. “Someone finally took a chance and said, ‘You know what? Hey, this sounds like something good,”’ Perry said. The donation and grant were enough for Perry to take the bus to different communities this summer, where it would host workshops on fashion design and social media. She started partnering with local high school students and arts organizations, like Wavvznewage, to teach the program. Then she opened up her mail one afternoon in July and learned the city of Worcester awarded her another grant using federal COVID-19 relief funding meant to help communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. This one was for $227,000. “I think I read the letter five times. And then I had someone else read it. I'm like, 'Can you tell me what that says?'"" Perry recalled. “I was just so happy and elated and excited.” With the help of Dan Ford, who runs another nonprofit that teaches youth how to fix cars, Perry said she now plans to use the grant money to host an after-school program on the bus for years to come. She envisions local university and high school instructors teaching children about a variety of topics, including film editing, robotics and 3D printing. She’s already witnessing the success of the summer workshops on the bus. During the bus’ recent stop in Great Brook Valley, more than two dozen children from the Worcester Boys and Girls Club took turns making pillows with the sewing machines and drawing on the electronic sketch pads. “The kids seem to be really enjoying themselves,” said Josh Brown, director of outreach for the Boys and Girls Club. “The things that they are experiencing — it goes a long way. It opens doors. Plants seeds.” One of the children, Marcus Williams, spent his hour on the bus drawing a self-portrait on a sketchpad. Williams said he loves art, but doesn’t have a computer at home. If he did, he said he’d look up pictures online and then practice drawing them. Once he finished creating his portrait, the instructors on the bus surprised him with a printed copy of the picture. “You’re telling me this is what came out?” Williams yelled. “I wanted this!”",Local,"Tue, 08 Aug 2023 05:00:04 EST",16f64f4c79f900f3621e1bf2efba904f
7399,New CDC report on autism shows children of color being diagnosed at a higher rate than white children,https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/03/30/new-cdc-report-on-autism-shows-children-of-color-being-diagnosed-at-a-higher-rate-than-white-children,"It’s a significant change from when autism was seen as a diagnosis for the white and wealthy, researcher says.","A new CDC report on autism is showing an all-time high in diagnoses among children, with one in 36 receiving a diagnosis compared to a rate of just one in 44 five years ago. The report also found, for the first time ever, that children of color are being diagnosed at a higher rate than white children. To help make sense of what the new data mean, autism researcher Dr. Sarabeth Broder-Fingert spoke with GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath. Broder-Fingert is a professor of pediatrics and associate director of research at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School. This transcript has been lightly edited. Arun Rath: Before we dive into the details of this new data, help us understand a bit more about what an autism diagnosis means for a child and their family. Sarabeth Broder-Fingert: Well, an autism diagnosis can actually mean a range of things because it's such a spectrum. In general, children will undergo relatively extensive testing to determine if they meet criteria for autism. Once obtaining a diagnosis, that's the gateway into getting a variety of treatment services that children need. Those can range from daily support for social communication, many children will also need additional support, things like occupational therapy and physical therapy. There are very high rates of other comorbid conditions, particularly mental health disorders, so it may also mean additional support for mental health concerns — along with the supports for core symptoms of autism. Rath: When you're looking at new data like this, how do you tell whether autism rates are rising versus, maybe, the testing is revealing more than it did in the past?Broder-Fingert: Yeah, this is a common point of conversation. I think that the rates are likely both rising, and we're doing a better job at detecting autism. I think it's probably both things together, although it is a little hard to pull apart because it's certainly possible that a lot of this relates to our ability to understand and detect autism more accurately and more fully than in years past, which allows us to find kids who are out there who had been missed previously. I think, and many people believe, that probably the larger contributor here is that we're doing a better job of actually finding these kids and being able to get them a diagnosis. With that said, it's undeniable that the rapid increase in prevalence is likely multifactorial. Rath: With what looks like a dramatic increase over just five years, do we have a sense of why autism rates are rising in that way? Broder-Fingert: Well, I think first, for sure, one reason is just that we're getting better at finding it. I think that the new data on race and ethnicity is a great example of that. Many of us in the field have been working for years, really focused on these dramatic disparities that exist in diagnosis. In the original CDC data that that came out almost 20 years ago now, there were profound differences by race and ethnicity in the prevalence numbers. We've been working hard to close that gap. Most people believe that that gap is only related, really, to society's ability to help diagnose and support those families and those kids have just been getting missed. In some ways, the new data is showing that both the prevalence and those numbers by race ethnicity have have dramatically changed are really a reflection of a lot of, I think, successes that we've had in the community trying to improve diagnostic services and address health disparities. With that said, I do think that although there's things to celebrate about the fact that we're doing a better job diagnosing children of color particularly, I think this is the the first step in a long list of things that need to be accomplished. I think we have achieved some better equity in diagnosis but these data don't reflect how many of these kids are actually getting into treatment. I do worry greatly that although we've decreased the disparities in actual diagnostic numbers, we haven't decreased the disparities in which of these kids are actually getting evidence-based treatment and all the support that they need. So, I think we still have a long way to go, but I do think that that these numbers should give us some hope that we are doing a better job at finding kids and getting them a diagnosis. Rath: That's fascinating. So, it used to be that the gap was that more white children were diagnosed with autism? And it's been a correction? Broder-Fingert: That's exactly right. There used to be really large differences by race and ethnicity. The challenge has been that, as a society, we were just not diagnosing Black children or children of color at the rate that we were diagnosing white children — for reasons such as bias within the health care system, structural racism and the tools that we use not being sensitive to different racial and ethnic backgrounds. I think there's been a huge effort across the country to try to close some of those gaps and I think that's that's what's happened here. Rath: That's fascinating, because it also seems like it would enforce a stereotype of autism somehow being a disease of affluence. Broder-Fingert: Exactly, and I do think that was a stereotype for a long time and has been a huge problem. There have been a number of us who have been working really hard to change that perception. I do think that we're having some impact, although we have a long way to go. For many years, it was believed that autism was a condition that was only in affluent or white populations. Rath: So, if there's been this lag with children of color not getting diagnosed and there's been this catching up on that, it would seem like there would also have to be a lag in treatment, right? And getting these children of color treatment at the same rate? Broder-Fingert: I think anyone who works in the community and anyone who looks at the data would know that, although we're now catching up on diagnostics, we still have a ways to go on treatment. Children of color still have a harder time getting all the different evidence-based treatments. As I mentioned before, autistic children will often need multiple treatments from different providers, from different service settings — whether it's the school and the health system or community resources. We know that, although we've made this gain in diagnosing children of color, we have not yet caught up in getting them into treatment. I think for those who are focused on equity and disparities, that is going to be a next really important step to focus on: really getting these kids into treatment and and supporting their families so that, once they're diagnosed, they have all the services they need. We're certainly not close there. But with that said, 15 years ago, I would have been very surprised that we have now made such an impact on diagnostic disparities. So I would say there's hope that, with the focus on treatment, that we can achieve a similar outcome that has been achieved here. Rath: Dr. Broder-Fingert, it is really eye-opening and helpful to be able to break down this data from the headlines in this way. You've done a brilliant job of it. Thank you so much. Broder-Fingert: Oh, my pleasure.",National,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 15:46:51 EST",6b954883e4a3924a6b7f58f48b0b5ba6
2277,Shootings at Revere Beach prompt search for answers beyond just more police,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/29/shootings-at-revere-beach-prompt-search-for-answers-beyond-just-more-police,Advocates suggest bring more adults to the area beaches may serve to head off violence,"Police stepped up their presence at Revere Beach in the wake of fights and two shootings there Sunday evening. But some open space advocates say there may be better ways — beyond law enforcement — to curb violence in these urban retreats.As summer beach season begins, these groups suggest that promoting the area’s urban beaches as gathering spaces for all generations could have a calming effect.“One of the ways we're looking at this is that multigenerational idea that community investment and presence on the beaches on a regular basis can set the tone that this is a place for everybody,” said Chris Mancini, executive director of Save the Harbor/Save the Bay. “And so when you come here, leave the fighting, leave the interest in violence somewhere else, because you are sharing this space with everybody.”Save the Harbor/Save the Bay runs the Metropolitan Beaches Commission for the state, helping oversee Revere and 14 other urban beaches from Nantasket in Hull up to Lynn and Nahant.Initial police reports suggested that Sunday’s violence in Revere involved teenagers. Two of the people injured were teens, and police arrested one young person for alleged illegal possession of a firearm.Neenah Estrella-Luna, a sociologist in East Boston — who co-authored an Amherst College study last year about inequities in access to open space —said more multigenerational beaches is a good idea.She urged the beach commission and the State Department of Conservation and Recreation to go a step further, hiring older staff skilled in youth social work.“If they had people who've experienced detention and experienced incarceration, who are doing more anti-violence, anti-gang social healing work, they're going to have those calming presences on the beaches and in the park spaces that would help mitigate some of this [violence],” Estrella-Luna told GBH News.A report on beach accessibility released earlier this month by the Metropolitan Beaches Commission highlighted public safety but also concerns that heavy-handed police response could “unfairly target groups of young people who are simply trying to beat the heat and have some fun.”Revere resident Jacqueline Monterroso, who participated in some of the commission’s hearings last year, told GBH News she appreciates seeing the police because she’s grown increasingly concerned about safety at the beach.“I think we really need to address this,” said Monterroso. “If this is how it's starting and it's not even summer yet and schools aren't out yet, I’m really fearing what's to come in the next months.”In a series of stories last year, the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting documented the uneven access to the state’s shoreline, partly because state law allows private property ownership of beachfront down to the low-tide line. Many coastal communities also impose parking and residency restrictions that dramatically limit beach access for non-residents. Such restrictions historically kept people of color from getting access to the shore and continue to do so, GBH’s report found.That leaves public beaches and those nearest public transportation, like Revere, as the only beach option for many city residents. Mancini and Monterroso both said they'd like to see improved transportation systems that could bring people to other beaches in state that are otherwise off-limits due to municipal restrictions. Such efforts could take some of the pressure off the urban beaches where parking lots often hit capacity early in the day. “These are in-demand places,” Mancini said. “They're being loved to their very limits,”",Local,"Mon, 29 May 2023 17:46:26 EST",7e841d63c495efd923f4913ee428d25c
3817,‘He pointed to me’: How an impromptu solo launched Kamasi Washington’s career,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/03/he-pointed-to-me-how-an-impromptu-solo-launched-kamasi-washingtons-career,The award-winning saxophonist and composer opens up about his formative years ahead of three consecutive nights of performing at Boston’s City Winery.,"For most of his childhood, Kamasi Washington didn’t have his heart set on music as a career. Then at age 15, he had an epiphany.“It was always going to be a part of my life,” he said. “I grew up in a household that allowed me to understand what it meant to be a professional musician.”Washington’s father, Rickey, was a saxophonist and flutist. And when Washington turned 13, he picked up his father’s old saxophone. But it took another two years, and an unexpected act by a music teacher, for him to realize his calling.Washington attended the Academy of Music of Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and was a member of the prestigious L.A. Multi School Jazz Band, a special program for exceptionally talented students. There, he played alongside young musicians who would go on to become heavyweights in the industry, like Terrace Martin, trombonist Isaac Smith and the Bruner brothers — Grammy-winning drummer Ronald Bruner Jr. and bassist Stephen Lee ""Thundercat"" Bruner.“They were all so good,” he said. “I was good in my school, but in that band, I wasn’t one of the soloists.”During a performance at the Playboy Jazz Festival — a yearly gathering of established and up-and-coming jazz musicians, now renamed the Hollywood Bowl Jazz Festival — the band's teacher, Reggie Andrews, did something that startled the young Washington. “He just randomly gave me a solo,” Washington said. “While I was on stage, he pointed to me. And I literally looked around like, 'What? Me?'”The scene remains emblazoned in his mind. He recalls the solo as being a sub-par. “People said I sounded good, but I just wasn’t happy with how I sounded,” he said.But it was that moment — and the awareness that he could have done better — that set Washington on the path to becoming a living legend.“That was the moment when I was like, ‘I’m going to really take this seriously,’” he said. “That’s when I was like, 'You know what? I’m going to practice eight hours a day.' Because I knew what I was supposed to do to get good. My dad had told me. I had read it in the books. And I knew I wasn’t really doing that.”Nearly three decades later, Washington’s name is synonymous with contemporary jazz and improvisation. He is a frequent collaborator with Kendrick Lamar, providing the saxophone on the rapper's award-winning albums, “To Pimp A Butterfly” and “DAMN.” He has performed with legends like Herbie Hancock. And he composed the Grammy-nominated score for Michelle Obama’s Netflix documentary, “Becoming.” But even with a stack of accolades, Washington doesn’t feel pressured to continue raising the bar.“I don’t think of it as pressure,” he said. “I’ve always looked at it as opportunity.”It’s a nonchalant attitude that might have come from the unexpected beginnings of his professional career. “I’m already beyond what I was dreaming about at that point in my life,” he said. His philosophy is that music is ""an expression of who you are,” rather than what a person hopes to become. At least one thing remains unchanged from that young, 13-year-old Washington to the 42-year-old he is today: his saxophone. Washington has continued to play the same horn his father gave him even before he had settled on music as a lifelong endeavor. Many artists spend their entire careers searching for the perfect instrument or equipment — but for Washington, it was love at first sight. “It is very, very, very rare. I play the same saxophone, same mouthpiece, even the same type of reeds,” he said. “I’m like the guy who married his high school sweetheart.”Kamasi Washington will perform at the City Winery in Boston with vocalist Ami Taf Ra on May 9, 10 and 11.",Local,"Wed, 03 May 2023 15:32:49 EST",e7abbbd723d01419b16dd926f2ff6a73
382,Once-abandoned mills are now home to thousands of Massachusetts residents,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/11/once-abandoned-mills-are-now-home-to-thousands-of-massachusetts-residents,Here's how Massachusetts became a model for turning industrial-era mills into modern housing.,"Lesly Melendez grew up in Lawrence when many of the city’s massive manufacturing buildings had begun to decay. All around her, the red-brick mills that once made Lawrence a global leader in textile production were vacant and “bombed out,” with pigeons and rats often the only inhabitants.“You think about pictures of war-torn areas, and you see buildings kind of their bricks falling apart and windows not existing,” Melendez said. “When you went outside Lawrence and people [asked], ‘Oh, you’re from Lawrence?’ as a kid, that was not a really good thing.” Many of those same mill buildings with their towering smokestacks still make up Lawrence’s skyline. But now, they look brand new and have thousands of families living inside them. As Massachusetts continues to suffer from a shortage of affordable housing, former mills like those in Lawrence are a bright spot. With the assistance of state and federal funding, developers have renovated and converted more than a hundred mills around the commonwealth into housing complexes in recent decades — projects that both provide much-needed homes and help revitalize post-industrial areas. But the conversion process can be expensive and slow, often involving the cleanup of pollutants from past industrial operations on the properties. And even when mills are redeveloped, some cater solely to people who can pay higher rents. Housing advocates say in order for Massachusetts to combat its affordability crisis, developers should prioritize converting more mills into apartments for lower-income people. In the 18th and 19th centuries, merchants built thousands of mills across New England, making the region a center of the American Industrial Revolution. Cities like Lawrence, Lowell and Holyoke were established for the sole purpose of becoming manufacturing centers. The mills used rivers and canals for energy to produce everything from textiles to paper. Because there were few environmental regulations at the time, the production processes often released toxic industrial chemicals into the air, waterways and ground. By the mid-1900s, the manufacturing sector around New England collapsed as companies moved operations to the South and overseas where labor was cheaper. Cities struggled to address the contaminants at the large, abandoned mills and find a new use for the buildings as environmental regulations started taking effect. “So this ends up becoming essentially an albatross,” said Justin Hollander, an urban and environmental policy professor at Tufts University. “Even if the owner wants to get rid of it, the new owner is burdened by this. They simply can’t say, ‘I’m just going to demolish the building.’ ... State law obligates them to invest in the cleanup.”Not only did the polluted mills pose health hazards to people living nearby, but they also became signs of neglect. Lesly Melendez, who now runs Groundwork Lawrence — a nonprofit that cleans up polluted industrial land — said the run-down buildings fueled a common feeling in Lawrence: that state and local leaders didn’t care about the people of color who lived near them. She remembered how crime and drug use surged around the 1980s. At one point, the city had the most incidents of arson and car theft per capita in the country. “It was a community that was impoverished, blighted, and people were looking for a way out and a way to numb the pain,” Melendez said. “The fact that you can now walk down Canal Street and see these beautiful, magnificent buildings brought back to life — it gives you a sense of pride, right? A sense of belonging.” The redevelopment of mills into housing has become more common over the last two decades thanks to changes in local zoning codes that have allowed residential development in what were once solely industrial areas. To help cover the high cost of cleaning up the contamination and renovating the massive buildings, developers have relied on expanded state and federal tax credits that reward them for preserving historical structures and creating affordable housing. Larry Curtis, the president of Boston-based WinnDevelopment, said the commonwealth offers more tax benefits for the mill projects than other New England states. “Massachusetts is the model,” said Curtis, who noted his firm has converted more than 30 mills in Massachusetts into mixed-income housing. There are several mill revitalization projects across the state underway or being planned, including in Worcester, Dudley and New Bedford. In Lawrence, Winn is converting the city’s oldest mill into a mixed-income housing complex with 69 units reserved for lower-income families. During a recent tour of the Stone Mill site, project director Angela Gile pointed to areas where workers removed toxic lead and asbestos that are common in languishing mills. And an old underground canal that once powered the mill still moves some water beneath the building, so she said workers had to elevate the ground floor to mitigate any flood risk. Other mills around the state have been harder to convert. Near downtown Haverhill, Mayor Jim Fiorentini walked the perimeter of a sprawling abandoned shoe mill one recent afternoon. Fiorentini has overseen the redevelopment of other Haverhill industrial facilities into affordable housing and wants to do the same with the crumbling shoe mill. But that hasn’t been possible because the building is polluted and connected to an old dam on the Little River, which developers fear could collapse and flood other parts of the city. Developers have told Haverhill officials they’ll only convert the site once the city removes the dam and the contaminated sediment in the water behind it. But that process alone could cost nearly $10 million, which city officials are still trying to secure funding for. “It’s been frustrating,” Haverhill community development division director Andrew Herlihy said. “This is a relic to 20-some odd years ago when Haverhill really had this depressed, post-industrial atmosphere.”In the meantime, city officials have said they’ve spent more than $100,000 repeatedly boarding up the vacant mill’s broken windows to keep teenagers out, to no avail. “We’re looking at a dump,” Fiorentini said. While post-industrial cities closer to Boston like Lowell and Lawrence are nearly finished redeveloping their old mills, other localities farther west with smaller housing markets lag behind.That’s because developers usually take out loans to build housing, knowing they’ll be able to repay the debt with future rental income. But average rents in western Massachusetts cities tend to be lower, which squeezes profits, so developers are more likely to invest in a larger city than converting a mill in cities like Holyoke. Housing advocates say that’s even though Holyoke has begun experiencing its own shortage of affordable housing and would benefit from the creation of new units in former mills. “There’s probably a good dozen [mills in the Holyoke area] that are just completely vacant and not in any use,” said Michael Moriarty, executive director of One Holyoke, a nonprofit trying to create more affordable housing in the city. “So whatever needs to be done has to be done. Converting old mills is a tried-and-true method.” The state tries to incentivize the inclusion of affordable housing in mill redevelopments — the quasi-public MassHousing, for example, only provides loans for redevelopment projects that include at least some affordable units. Still, many mills are converted into luxury housing. Jessica Andors — who leads Lawrence CommunityWorks, a nonprofit that converts mills into affordable apartments — noted that about two-thirds of the more than 2,500 total housing units in Lawrence’s former mills are too expensive for people with lower incomes. “[The conversions] are absolutely a success story,” Andors said. “The thing is in mill redevelopment — as in all housing redevelopment — we have to pay attention to what the affordability mix is, what our vision is for our communities. Are they going to be inclusive? Are they going to be equitable?”Andors said the hope is that as developers keep converting mills, they help more people like Isabel Echavarria. She previously lived in a run-down two-bedroom attic apartment with her parents in Lawrence for $1,500 a month. The uneven floors of the apartment regularly caused her 87-year-old father to trip and fall, and the fridge would randomly stop working at times, spoiling their food. The family now lives in an income-restricted three-bedroom mill apartment, paying $1,300 a month. Echavarria said they couldn’t be happier. “I’ve had a fabulous experience,” she said in Spanish through an interpreter. “The building is clean and safe. ... This is a great opportunity, especially for low-income families.” You can share your Priced Out story or ask a question you’d like answered by filling out this Google form.

57,Housing nonprofit breaks ground on facility for middle-income seniors,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/06/housing-nonprofit-breaks-ground-on-facility-for-middle-income-seniors,The development hopes to tackle a lack of options for middle-income seniors.,"A groundbreaking ceremony Monday kicked off construction at Opus Newton, a middle-income senior living development touted by housing developer 2Life Communities as the first of its kind in the nation. The housing nonprofit offers government-subsidized options for seniors, and the state is full of luxury housing for those in the upper end of the income bracket, said 2Life President and CEO Amy Schectman. But when it comes to the middle, a majority of older adults are left with few options. “They can't afford the high-end stuff and they don't qualify for the lower-end stuff because they earn a little bit too much money or saved a little bit too much money,” Schectman said. “There's a moral imperative to close that market gap and to provide something that offers a chance for the people in the middle.”The nonprofit spent the last seven years trying to figure out how to address the needs of this specific demographic, Schectman says. To keep monthly fees low, residents pay a one-time “community share” fee for their unit, funding that helps pay for the construction period. By providing at-home care on site, residents can opt in or out of services depending on need, which reduces costs for the nonprofit. Meals will be served three times per week, instead of nightly, and residents sign a contract to volunteer at least 10 hours of their time per month to help out with the needs of the community. “People are coming up with more and more really interesting topics that they're going to lead, groups they're going to be part of,” Schectman said. Volunteer hours can be used creatively, and some future residents have already suggested a jazz group, a choir, lecture series and question and answer sessions with nurses. “Lots of vibrant activity is already coming from our residents.” Units at Opus begin at $380,000 to buy and $1,800 monthly to rent, according to Schectman. Opus leverages residents’ home equity and offers the option to receive 80% of their up-front “community share” payment when they leave, or use the funds for their care.Of the 174 available units, 95% have already been sold, according to a 2Life spokesperson, which enabled the nonprofit to begin construction a full year ahead of schedule. MassDevelopment, the state's finance and development agency, is supporting the project with $130 million in tax-exempt bond financing. The new housing development is slated to open in the summer of 2025, connected to the Coleman House operated by 2Life (formerly Jewish Housing for the Elderly) on the Jewish Community Center of Greater Boston’s Campus. “Massachusetts faces a housing crisis, and projects like Opus Newton … bring us an important step forward in easing the housing burden for Greater Boston and for Massachusetts,” MassDevelopment President and CEO Dan Rivera said in a statement. State and city leaders including Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Massachusetts) and Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller were on hand for the groundbreaking Monday.“We know so many individuals in our lives are making choices about where to live based on the high cost of housing,” said Driscoll. “Let’s make those choices easier. Let’s allow people to live and grow and age with dignity in the communities they love. This is a thrilling day for Newton. Let’s make sure we can have more thrilling days across this commonwealth.""Single older people in Massachusetts are more likely to face economic insecurity than their peers in any other state — despite higher average incomes than elderly people in many other parts of the country, according to a UMass Boston study from 2019. Last month, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced 800 new affordable housing units throughout the city, including 160 income-restricted units for seniors.",Local,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 16:41:47 EST",c982c8696245f8f1ef1417def5ec39f5
70,"New poll finds school safety, academic success are top concerns for Massachusetts parents",https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/05/24/new-poll-finds-school-safety-academic-success-are-top-concerns-for-massachusetts-parents,Some cite decline in extracurricular options post-pandemic.,"A new statewide survey of Massachusetts parents and caregivers found that 77% feel satisfied with their child’s school. But the results of the poll, conducted by MassINC, also showed that nearly 40% of parents are very or somewhat concerned about their child’s academic progress, and those concerns were most prevalent among families of English learners, parents of special needs students and Black and Latino parents. The findings were discussed Wednesday at a Suffolk University forum hosted with The Education Trust in Massachusetts. “These numbers are not surprising when you look at who has the resources and who does not,” said parent Richard Carter from Taunton. ""Data shows that children who have the resources excel and do well better than the ones that don’t.” This poll is the eighth in a series of surveys conducted by MassINC highlighting education and parents' ongoing concerns for students’ social, emotional and academic development post-pandemic.Steve Koczela, president of MassINC, said the grade that parents choose to give their child’s school is usually based on their child’s personal experience. “You'll see that there's pretty different things that parents are thinking about when they think about this question and arrive at, OK, what would that grade be? It's not just academics,"" he said. ""It's not just your own child's teacher.”Many Black and Latino parents reported a decine in the number of extracurricular activities for their children. Only 35% of Black parents and 38% of Latino parents said their children had the same number of activities this year compared to school before the pandemic. More than half of white parents said the same. Approximately a quarter of parents also reported that the time of day, cost and transportation issues were barriers to their child’s participation in extracurricular activities. School safety was also a problem, with more than 40% of parents citing it as their top concern. Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said safety can mean different things to different parents. She said she recently spent time with a group of parents in Roxbury who were concerned about safety in poorly maintained schools. “They're concerned that ... their kids are going to school in a building that has high levels of lead in the water,"" she said.Concerns about student mental health appeared to decline slightly. Forty-five percent of parents remain “very or somewhat concerned” about their child’s mental health. Nearly half of parents said their child's school does not offer enough mental health resources to students.",Education,"Wed, 24 May 2023 17:05:36 EST",1f53edb52349b6040d6f678db120644d
1006,"Analysis: The Celtics gave their all, but could not beat the Heat",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/30/analysis-the-celtics-gave-their-all-but-could-not-beat-the-heat,The Celtics' season has come to a heart-wrenching end.,"The Celtics' season came to a heart-wrenching end after losing game seven of the Eastern Conference finals to the Miami Heat last night at the Garden, 132-84. And with that, so did the C's chances of making history as the first team in the NBA to win a series after being down three games to nothing. GBH's Esteban Bustillos was at the game and joined Morning Edition hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel to talk about it on Tuesday morning. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: So first off, before we get into everything that went wrong, there were quite a few celebrity sightings last night. There were a bunch of former Celtics. Esteban Bustillos: Yeah, there were. Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, I think I saw a couple more. Paris Alston: Trying to bring some of that '08 championship magic into the building. Bustillos: For as big of the comparisons about the '04 Red Sox were, there were not as many as I thought. They had Kevin Millar on video, I don't know if he was there in person. So that that was a little odd.Siegel: I also saw Donnie Wahlberg was there, 21 Savage, Aly Raisman, the Olympic gymnast. Before we do get into the game itself, being there in the company of all of these people, what was it like inside of the Garden, before things even got started?Bustillos: The energy was high. The energy was super high. As I mentioned about the '04 Red Sox comparisons, pre-game they had a hype video with a montage of some of the best moments from the '04 ALCS. Paul Pierce was just on the court, just impromptu hyping the crowd up. I mean, this was 30 minutes before the game. The whole place was hyped and then the game started. Alston: And what happened from there? Bustillos: It was really just the first possession. Jayson Tatum went up for a layup, drew contact with Miami's Gabe Vincent. He came down on his foot. Now, anyone who knows, who's ever played basketball, knows that when your foot lands on their player's foot, that's it. That's a graveyard for healthy ankles. And he just immediately was down in pain. There was a nervous murmur that spread throughout TD Garden. He did a pretty good job, I would say, of disguising that pain, but he just wasn't himself for the rest of the night. And Boston's groove was thrown off. Afterwards, Tatum walked with a limp in the press room. Jayson Tatum [previously recorded]: It, you know, kind of impacted me. The rest of the night it swelled up and it was just frustrating. And I was kind of like a shell of myself. It's tough to move. Siegel: So I didn't stay up to watch the game because Paris and I are on the air super early here. Paris actually did watch, which maybe she's regretting. So I've heard a little bit about this game. I mean, I know losing Tatum was big, but Boston only trailed by ten going into the fourth quarter. So what happened there? Bustillos: Yeah. So given the situation they were in with their best player essentially playing on one leg, Boston did a pretty good job of putting up a fight through three quarters. They actually outscored Miami 25-to-24 in that third quarter. The start of the fourth, though, Miami went on a 7-0 run, Boston was down 17, and that's just too hard of a hole to come out of. Boston, they played in hot spurts throughout the game, but Miami consistently hit shots, especially from three-point range, where they were 14 of 28, the Celtics were 9 of 42 from three. Boston would sometimes rush shots, they would look flustered on offense, and the offense just wasn't there. Jaylen Brown, who we're going to talk about a lot, he was 8 of 23 from the field for just 19 points and he just had a bad night when Boston needed him the most with Jayson Tatum, basically, again, just playing on one foot. Jaylen Brown [previously recorded]: You know, my team turned to me to make plays and etc., and I came up short. I failed. And it's tough. You know, I give credit to Miami, but just a terrible job. Alston: So there's no question here that the Celtics lost a key link in the chain with Jayson Tatum and the ankle injury. And I think there's a lot of speculation about how if only that hadn't happened. But at the same time, we've got to remember that Boston was clawing itself out of a 3-0 hole running into this game. So you're having to give 110% for four games in a row. So how much of this is that part of it? Bustillos: I mean, it's definitely part of it, right? There's a reason the Celtics were only the fourth team in NBA history to even be in that position, coming down from 3-0 to tie up the series. But, you know, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have to be perfect or where your health has to be perfect, to when you want to give yourself a little bit of room for error. And being 3-0, there is no more room for error. Al Horford said that they kind of had to play with desperation in the series after falling down the way they did. Al Horford [previously recorded]: There's a lot that goes into it physically, emotionally. There's a lot that goes into it and you get to this point and you still have to play another game. You still have to win another game. And trust me, every guy in the locker room, we wanted it really, really bad. And, you know, it's tough. But as hard as it is, you know, we have to learn from this. Siegel: Let's talk a little bit about learning from this, because going into the season, the C's were favored by a lot of people to make another run at the championship after getting to the finals last year. Where do they go from here? Bustillos: I think one of the big questions is what do they do with Jaylen Brown? He's going to be owed a supermax contract because he made an All-NBA team that would be up to $295 million. That's a lot of money. Will the Celtics want to pay that? Will they want to trade him? For people who want to trade him, my question would be, are you really ready to break up one of the best duos in the NBA with Tatum and Brown over the course of these past few years, even with how his season, especially at the end, went? Alston: So lastly here, Esteban, we've got to talk about Joe Mazzulla, because he obviously was the coach here. But he was sort of thrown into this position because of what happened with former coach Ime Udoka. And I think there's been a lot of questions about whether he rose to the occasion.Bustillos: I would say there is that question, are they going to keep him? My question would be, again, to your point, he's learned a lot. He was put in a bad position. Can he learn from these mistakes going forward? And if you go and get a new coach, is that going to fix all your problems? That would be the fourth coach for the Celtics in four years. That's just not something that most franchises that are looking to win a championship would do. They need to find some consistency. Siegel: Esteban, before we officially say goodbye, Nuggets or Heat?Bustillos: Nuggets in six.Alston: And get some dipping sauce.",Local,"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:47:22 EST",773b1ce4b7ae4ac6e3cc32fa6fb8e1cd

But when members of Boston's Ukrainian community and their supporters flooded Copley Square on Sunday, they signaled their resolve to see Ukraine endure as a sovereign, independent nation—no matter how long it takes.Bracing a bitter cold made worse by a February breeze, demonstrators carried signs along with blue and yellow flags, now recognized around the world as a symbol of resistance and solidarity. Vsevolod Petriv, president of the Boston branch of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, estimated that 2,000 people attended the rally. He said that the war in Ukraine is about autocracy versus democracy. And he was happy to see the solidarity of the Ukrainian diaspora evident in that struggle. ""Ukrainians are spread throughout the world due to all the different conflicts,"" he said. ""And all of these different pockets of Ukrainians are joining hands together. And that's pretty cool.""Among the speakers at the rally was Rep. Stephen Lynch, who compared Russian president Vladimir Putin's efforts in Ukraine to those of Adolf Hitler in World War II. ""I think it's important for all of us to remember that this is not just about Ukraine,"" Lynch said. ""Ukraine stands at the frontline of democracy in Europe.""Although she wasn't a speaker, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued a statement through a spokesperson proclaiming Sunday as Boston Ukraine Day. ""On this day and in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, I commend them for their strength, courage and bravery and do urge all citizens of the City of Boston to stand together in support of the Ukrainian people in this fight for freedom,"" the statement read. Sunday's crowd was a mix of people, including many who emigrated from the Eastern European country, people with ties to it and others who were there to support Ukraine on ideological grounds. Leonid Furman, 65, lives in Stoughton and came to the United States from Russia 31 years ago. He said he sees the war as something bigger than merely a fight for one country's independence.""In my opinion, it's not the war just against Ukraine. It's a war against the whole West,"" he said. At the rally's end, demonstrators stepped inside Trinity Church for an exhibit, refreshments and a special service for Ukraine later in the afternoon. Outside, Dariella Yasyukevych, who lives in Lynn and came to the U.S. from Ukraine 15 years ago, said that the past year has been tough, with family members still in Ukraine. ""That means a lot to every Ukrainian,"" she said. ""And we appreciate that the whole world finally knows that Ukraine is not a part of Russia. That Ukraine's been independent for 31 years and that we exist, we have our culture, we have our food, our traditions, our language.""She's hopeful for two things going forward: that Ukraine will win and that Russia will be held accountable for its actions.",Local,"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 19:58:32 EST",06182f3410840e249719a92c2a1d5004
5777,"Analysis: As Warren seeks a third term, her position is stronger than it seems",https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/03/27/analysis-as-warren-seeks-a-third-term-her-position-is-stronger-than-it-seems,An array of factors could help the senior senator from Massachusetts win reelection.,"As Elizabeth Warren launches a bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate, recent polling might seem, at first glance, to suggest that her reelection is far from guaranteed.Earlier this year, a survey by the MassINC Polling Group found Massachusetts residents sharply divided on Warren, with 41% viewing her favorably and 36% unfavorably. A similar split was evident on the question of whether Warren should run again: 43% said she should, while 36% said she shouldn’t.But MassINC pollster Steve Koczela says when it comes to gauging Warren’s current prospects, those results might actually paint an inordinately bleak picture. “She starts off in a pretty similar place, honestly, to where she was in 2018,” Koczela said, referring to Warren’s last reelection bid. “Her polling, looking back at 2017, wasn’t particularly sparkling, but she went on and cruised to reelection.”In the 2018 general election, Warren faced former state representative Geoff Diehl — who had triumphed in a three-way Republican primary — and beat him handily, 60% to 36%. Koczela’s caveat comes with an asterisk of its own: Diehl, who’d been an early supporter of Donald Trump, personified the Massachusetts Republican Party’s recent turn to the right and preference for ideological purity over electability. A few years after losing to Warren, when then-Republican Gov. Charlie Baker was still weighing whether to seek a third term, Diehl announced a gubernatorial bid of his own, seemingly undeterred by his Senate loss or Baker’s high statewide approval ratings. Baker didn’t run again, and Diehl lost the governor’s race to Maura Healey in a landslide.After a disastrous 2022 election cycle, the Mass. GOP ousted former party chair Jim Lyons and replaced him with Amy Carnevale, who has vowed to rebuild it from the ground up. But Carnevale’s project is just beginning, and the Mass. GOP is still at a nadir in terms of influence and reputation. Against that backdrop, it’s not clear that any electable Republican capable of going toe to toe with Warren — who made a strong run for the presidency in the 2020 cycle — will try to unseat her next year. “We’ve seen quality Republican moderates run and win the governor’s office in Massachusetts,” said UMass Boston political scientist Erin O’Brien. “But the Massachusetts Republican Party has put out people like Charlie Baker, who was that popular governor, and run people like Geoff Diehl.“In the abstract, a moderate Republican could do well in Massachusetts,” O’Brien added. “But it’s only in the abstract, because that individual either doesn’t exist or has been forced out of Massachusetts politics.”In a text message, Carnevale told GBH News that she expects the party will field a credible challenge to Warren 2024, and that “at least two Republicans” are currently considering a run. She declined to identify them.Warren will also be boosted, in her latest bid, by high popularity among members of her own party — which make up roughly a third of the state’s voters. In MassINC’s poll, which was conducted in late January and early February, 68% of Democrats viewed her favorably and 69% thought she should run again. In March, another poll, conducted by Change Research for Northwind Strategies, found that while almost as many people viewed Warren unfavorably as favorably, 30% viewed her very favorably — more than any other Massachusetts politician polled, including Baker.Those numbers suggest two things. First, in a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, Warren would benefit from a loyal core of supporters who would organize for her, give her money and show up at the polls. And second, anyone who might entertain the prospect of a primary challenge against Warren would face a daunting challenge. The timing of Warren’s announcement is also fortuitous. As bad as the crisis of confidence currently roiling the U.S. banking system is, it’s likely to be a political asset for Warren as she begins campaigning again in earnest. “That’s ... her bread-and-butter sort of issue,” said Shannon Jenkins, a political scientist at UMass Dartmouth. “That’s what she knows inside and out. She’s one of the foremost experts on banking policy in the U.S. government right now.”By renewing her calls for rigorous regulation of the banking industry, Jenkins added, Warren can bolster her standing with the progressive Democrats who make up her political base while appealing to other voters, as well.“Not a lot of people are pro-big banks, right?” said Jenkins. “It’s just kind of a gut reaction from voters.”Despite all these advantages, though, Warren has some weaknesses that are worth bearing in mind as the 2024 Massachusetts Senate race shapes up.Koczela notes that, when the MassINC poll was conducted earlier this year, Warren’s standing was relatively weak among younger voters, many of whom hadn’t yet formed an opinion of her. Within the state, she’s also more popular with well-educated voters and voters who live close to Boston. In an email, Tatishe Nteta, a political scientist at UMass Amherst and the director of the UMass Poll, noted that surveys he’s worked on show a “steady majority” of Massachusetts residents approve of Warren’s performance, and that she’s been a reliable champion on student-loan forgiveness, income inequality and several other progressive causes highlighted in her campaign kickoff video.But Nteta also said Warren’s performance in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary — in which she finished third, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — suggests she could be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right.“Some will say that voters in Massachusetts voted strategically for a candidate that could win in a general election matchup with Trump, but some might view these results as evidence of Warren’s weakness among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and among independents in the state,” Nteta wrote.",Politics,"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:21:01 EST",5f3ed869cb0d98d1d6d7f6380b05e3e0
539,Roxbury Community College celebrates its 50th anniversary with fanfare and hip-hop,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/05/11/roxbury-community-college-celebrates-its-50th-anniversary-with-fanfare-and-hip-hop,"“It's really a testament to this community's strength and resilience.""","For 50 years Roxbury Community College has been offering affordable education in a town that is famous for very old, established and economically elite educational establishments. And while 50 might seem very young in the life span of a college in this college town, it’s a turning point that RCC is transforming into a three-day blockbuster event this weekend, featuring everything from food trucks to film screenings, with hip-hop performances along the way. Jennie McDonald-Brown, executive director of development for RCC, said Roxbury has long been both the geographical and social justice center for Boston. The city has fought for the college to exist — and she’s excited it now has the opportunity to give back to its neighborhood.“It's really a testament to this community's strength and resilience,” McDonald-Brown said. “They advocated for an institution of higher learning that was affordable and accessible for the neighborhood. And we're still here 50 years later. [The anniversary weekend] is an awesome opportunity that's going to pay homage to all of the people who made the college kind of come to be and all of the folks who have continued to contribute over the course of its 50 years.”Mcdonald-Brown said she's enthused about sharing the college’s vision for its next 50 years, including building a new Center for Economic and Social Justice, Mayor Wu’s program that will make community college tuition free for Boston residents and continuing to find career pathways for students. One of the things that sets RCC apart from other higher-ed institutions in the area, and that McDonald-Brown says makes RCC special, is that it’s a predominantly Black institution, with a faculty that mirrors the student body.“This is a place that's a lot more than just the courses and the career development,” she said. “We've got a food pantry, we have mental health support, we have a program called Project Access that really provides holistic support for all the nonacademic things that really get in the way of degree completion. We have the Dropout Academy. I think there's just a lot of resources to help ensure that once folks get here, they're able to persist, they're able to finish and go on to either a four year college or onto the career pathway that they're excited about.”The RCC 50th commemoration will kick off with an alumni panel discussion on Thursday and the RCC commencement ceremony on Friday. Haqikah Greaves, who completed her studies at RCC while pregnant with her first child, is the commencement speaker for the RCC graduation this year. She says she’s thankful the college is supportive of helping students fulfill their dreams. “RCC is really a good school that supports you and the moment you walk in the school you get support from the staff, they don't judge you, they're just there to help you with anything that you need,” she said. “They have so many services there for students and they always try to help them with anything that they need.”Dr. Tariana V. Little says that RCC is exactly what she needed. As a METCO student who was bussed from Dorchester to the suburbs, at her suburban high school most of the students planned to attend a four-year university right after graduation. She, however, decided to take a different path, starting her undergraduate education at RCC.“It was exactly what I needed,” she said. “To be educated in my community with students that are Black and brown and offer that psychological safety that is so key for minority students to feel safe and included in the classroom.”In this spirit of inclusion, RCC is sharing a birthday with hip-hop — the genre is also celebrating its own 50th anniversary this year.

3106,How one nonprofit is integrating reading into pediatric care,https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2023/07/27/how-one-nonprofit-is-integrating-reading-into-pediatric-care,"Experts say reading to young children is beneficial not just for language development, but for a strong parent-child bond.","Experts say a child's health and well-being during the first three years of their life will affect their future learning, behavior and health. Countless studies show that reading to children during that period is crucial for their cognitive development and for fostering a strong parent-child bond. The nonprofit Reach Out and Read aims to make that goal attainable and achievable by integrating reading into pediatric care, thereby setting the stage for lifelong success. Dr. Eileen Costello, medical director of Reach Out and Read, says there’s no easier way to help shape a child’s brain than setting aside time to read with your child.“You know, there’s nothing quite as simple an intervention as reading to children — having a child on your lap or snuggled up right next to you with a book between your hands,” Costello said. “Kids learn so much, both about the way that language works, the way that stories are told, and about relationships and bonding with people that they love.” Now a nationwide program, Reach Out and Read began in Massachusetts over 30 years ago at Boston Medical Center while Costello was in training. Attending physicians brought in books for young patients to take home, which sparked the idea for Reach Out and Read. Now, almost 2,000 pediatricians have been trained across Massachusetts, and about 240,000 kids every year are served by Reach Out and Read.“We’re trying to reach kids whose families are not going out to libraries and bookstores because they’re living in poverty, or they don’t have the time because they’re working so hard, or they weren’t raised with books in the home,” she said. “Then, we make it part of a pediatric visit effort to say, ‘Oh, here, I’m going to see a 9-month-old right now for a well child visit. I’m going to bring a book into the room.’” Costello said, as a pediatrician, she sees firsthand the positive effects of early childhood reading. She says the children do better in kindergarten, become more familiar with language, and understand how words on pages correlate with words spoken out loud. But it also helps her understand her patients on a social-emotional level.“When I see a child in a primary care setting, I learn a lot by watching how that child interacts with the book and with their parents and with me,” she said. “Is there joy? Is there a connection? Are they looking at a picture smiling and then looking at me or their mom or their dad to make sure that they’re enjoying it? That kind of shared attention is something we want to see pretty early in a child’s life.” By the time a baby is 6 months old, they are able to interpret emotion and recognize their own name. By 12 months, they have a slight understanding of basic, spoken commands. But Costello said that just because a child doesn’t understand the words in a book, parents should still read to their kids.“Kids love repetition, so we advise parents to just read it over and over again. If they throw it on the floor, pick it up. Make up stories! You know, some families like the books that don’t even have words associated with them, and they just make things up,” she said.With Massachusetts as its flagship state, Reach Out and Read’s influence has already expanded significantly, and Costello says the work isn’t over. The nonprofit is already working to become a part of every federally qualified health center, and Costello also wants to expand across languages and cultures. “You know, handing a Spanish language children's book to a child and her grandmother, who only speaks Spanish, is an amazing experience because the grandmother lights up, ‘Oh, my God, it's in Spanish. I can read this to her!’” she said. “It's just such a wonderful way to keep their own language and culture alive.”",Education,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 09:50:16 EST",b95e9946fb399413e50339ba6029e791
2583,"As Massachusetts weighs physician-assisted death, a California reporter explains her state's rollout",https://www.wgbh.org/news/national-news/2023/05/15/as-massachusetts-weighs-physician-assisted-death-a-california-reporter-explains-her-states-rollout,California legalized medically assisted suicide in 2016 under then-Gov. Jerry Brown.,"Earlier this month, new polling showed that nearly three out of four voters in Massachusetts support a bill that would allow terminally ill adults the option to be given life-ending medication. Should legislation advance in the State House, Massachusetts would join the 10 states and Washington, D.C. that have already legalized physician-assisted death.One of those states is California, where the legislation passed and was signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016. Health reporter April Dembosky of California’s KQED station covering the Bay Area joined GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the rollout of physician-assisted death in California. What follows is a lightly edited transcript.Arun Rath: There are a few different terms and euphemisms for the process: medical aid in dying, physician-assisted suicide, the right to die, to name a few. You’ve written about these euphemisms. What is the evolution of it? Is it all about just moving away from the term ""suicide""?April Dembosky: It’s interesting. I covered the debates around this bill throughout the time that it was moving through the Legislature. And throughout that time, I was actually lobbied by people on both sides about what terms to use. At the time, in California, we started out referring to the practice as assisted suicide because that was the term that people knew and because this was the style that was recommended by the Associated Press. But during that time, proponents really argued that that term was not accurate. They said, you know, suicide refers to someone who wants to die, whereas people who were seeking this kind of care wanted to live but were already dying, and the process was about hastening their death, not causing it. At the same time, the terms that proponents were using tended to be jargony or, as you said, euphemistic. They were difficult to grasp. You know, especially back then — aid in dying, death with dignity — people didn't really understand exactly what those terms meant. What we ended up doing was we ended up trying to avoid using either side's preferred language. We would just try to put the law in context and say, this is a law that allows terminally ill people to take lethal medication to hasten their death. I will say once the bill became law here, we did become a little bit more sympathetic to the proponents and started to veer away from using terms like assisted suicide, although I do believe that is still the official term used by the AP.Rath: Tell us about how the process has worked as it’s been rolled out over the last several years.Dembosky: The first thing to say is that since this became law, not a lot of people have actually taken advantage of it. In the last three years, our state data shows that less than 500 people a year will take these lethal medications to end their lives.Rath: For a state the size of California, that’s not a lot of people.Dembosky: It is .001% of the number of people who die in California every year. So it’s a very, very small number. Part of this is because a lot of people aren’t interested, or a lot of people don’t know about it. But especially in the earlier years, there was also an issue with being able to find a doctor who was willing and trained to provide this kind of service. So even people who didn't know about it and wanted to take advantage of it couldn't necessarily find someone to help them. Our law in California was quite clear that this is optional, that no doctor has to do it if they have objections to it. So, for example, all of the Catholic systems in our state actually forbid their doctors from participating. But other large health care systems, like Kaiser Permanente and Sutter, started programs where they started to reach out to physicians to find out who was interested. And then they started to do training and education so that they would understand all the protocols and science around the medication. We also had a nonprofit group that began a centralized referral system. It's called the American Clinicians Academy on Medical Aid in Dying. Patients can go to this website, fill out an intake form, and if they qualify, they'll be matched with a doctor near them who's willing to provide the service.Rath: So overall, on the patient’s side, for people who do want to pursue that option, how difficult is it to go through legally?Dembosky: It's interesting that you phrase it as difficult, because I think some of the early adopters, if you will, who did try to take advantage of this law made complaints that it was too difficult. I think if you were to ask some of the opponents of the bill, that was, by design, there was really fierce debate around this bill. Most of the opposition came from disability rights advocates who feared that there would be coercion, that people who were living with disabilities might be pressured by their family members or even by doctors to give up on life-saving care that was perhaps expensive and choose this option to end their lives. The people who were pushing the bill really listened to these concerns and worked a lot of safeguards into the bill. For example, two doctors have to verify that the person has a terminal illness and has six months or less to live. The patient has to request the medication three times before they can get it, and one of those times has to be in writing. And then there's also a waiting period of 15 days between the first two requests. One of the early studies that was done around the practice actually found that close to a quarter of the people who wanted this medication were actually dying during that 15-day waiting period and were unable to have the deaths that they had hoped for. Rath: Obviously, this being applied disproportionately to the disabled or to the elderly or to people who might be poorer or other kinds of disadvantaged communities is kind of a nightmare scenario that people who are opposed to these laws tended to lay out. How much are those other fears coming into play?Dembosky: The data we have from California shows that these fears or assertions are not actually being borne out. I would say from a demographic perspective, physician-assisted death or aid in dying has been largely a white enterprise. To date, 87% of people who have taken these medications in California are white. Overwhelmingly, they are highly educated, having at least some college education, if not a college or a graduate degree. The vast majority of people who take the medication take it for a terminal illness like cancer, so 70% of people who have taken it have some kind of cancer. After that, it's 11% that have a neurological disease like ALS or Parkinson's. And then after that, it's heart disease or respiratory disease. We're also not seeing some of the fears around people with disabilities. So we don't know what percentage of people who have taken the drug have a non-terminal disability. But what we do know is that if they took the drug, it's most likely because they also had a terminal illness, most likely cancer. Rath: I’m wondering if, on the other side, if those disparities reflect, say, people of color or people who are economically disadvantaged are not getting as much access to these services or maybe other aspects about why they’re not opting in?Dembosky: The proponents of this practice would certainly argue that that is the case. They would say there hasn’t been enough outreach to let people know that this is available.",National,"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:58:17 EST",637206047a0a2221887bd661c2bd424b
2307,"This no-frills college helps students get a degree quickly, simply and affordably",https://www.wgbh.org/news/international-news/2023/07/20/this-no-frills-college-helps-students-get-a-degree-quickly-simply-and-affordably,"COVENTRY, England — When she finished high school, Helen Kinchin got what was supposed to be a temporary job, after which she planned to go to college.","COVENTRY, England — When she finished high school, Helen Kinchin got what was supposed to be a temporary job, after which she planned to go to college.Fourteen years later, she was in the same job and had two kids, but still no degree.That's when Kinchin, now 36, found a way to finally resume her education in a way that was fast, simple and comparatively cheap.She enrolled at a university where students can start at any of six times during the year, take just one subject at a time for the same four hours every weekday, and end up with a bachelor's degree in three years. There are no electives; just about the only choice is whether to go in the mornings or the afternoons.The place she found all this was CU Coventry, originally called Coventry University College, an example of a ""no-frills"" approach to higher education in this historic industrial city about 100 miles northwest of London. An education here can be cheaper, faster, simpler and less intimidating for students at a time when going to college has otherwise become more complicated, with all kinds of add-ons that push up prices.The approach can make life easier for exactly the kinds of people universities are trying to recruit in many countries where enrollment is declining, including the United States. Getting child care is simpler for student parents when they have a predictable schedule, for example, rather than classes that meet at different times on different days. And not all students care about electives or extracurricular activities; a growing number just want to graduate.This assembly-line-style approach also vastly lowers the cost of doing business for the university. CU Coventry doesn't have to juggle faculty assignments or classroom space or offer many of the extras other institutions have added over time that don't have anything to do with education.""When we started, we stripped things back,"" said Ian Dunn, the affable, white-bearded provost, who sits in a pink hoodie in a lunchroom filled with blond wood and natural light. ""We're very much focused on transactional learning — the systematization of the teaching approach and the way in which we employ people to work in that model.""The library, for instance, has only books connected to the subjects of the classes. There are no athletics, though students can participate in the broader activities of the parent Coventry University nearby, or pay extra if they decide to use the gym. And faculty don't do research; they only teach.""We fit around the lives of students rather than making them fit around us,"" Dunn said.It wasn't entirely out of the goodness of their hearts that administrators here created a low-cost university. The program was spun off a decade ago by the then-169-year-old Coventry University.The move came after universities in England were allowed to raise tuition to a maximum of 9,000 pounds a year (since raised again to 9,250 pounds, or about $11,750). That was nearly triple the previous amount, and universities were encouraged to compete for students.""This was an existential moment for a university like ours,"" Dunn said. With tuition being increased by so much, ""we felt there was a whole potential demographic that was going to be pushed out of higher education with that change."" That demographic, he added, would most likely be ""more disadvantaged students or students tied to their locations because of financial or personal responsibilities.""So the university set out to ""design a model where we could control the cost of the delivery of education so we could offer back to the students some of that savings.""""You don't have to sacrifice your life"" to go to collegeWhen it opened to students in 2012, CU Coventry set its price at 4,800 pounds a year, about half of what the top universities charge. It offered degrees in subjects including business management, accounting, cloud computing, marketing and public relations, tourism and hospitality management, and early childhood development and learning. It has since added campuses in Scarborough and London.Though some students come straight from high school or after a gap year, the average age is 35. ""Mature,"" they're called, in England.A small but growing proportion of students at U.S. colleges and universities are also older than the traditional 18 to 22. They're among the more than 40 million adults who have some college credits but no degrees, and who recruiters are going after as enrollment falls. Among the top reasons they haven't come back, according to a Gallup survey: cost and family responsibilities.Those are two things CU Coventry has tried to fix, with its comparatively low tuition and daily four-hour classes.""People can study while having obligations, family obligations. You don't have to sacrifice your life,"" said one student here, Mabel Makombore, who works part time while in school. ""We're all struggling financially,"" she said.This West Midlands city's dominance in auto manufacturing made it a German bombing target during World War II, an attack still visible in the ruins of the cathedral — left as a memorial — but the car factories and the jobs they represented are mostly gone.CU Coventry students talk of other advantages in addition to the price, including each term's focus on a single subject: what Dunn referred to as a ""modular delivery"" system. ""We're only doing one thing at a time,"" said Kinchin, who just graduated with a degree in applied bioscience and is moving on to get a Ph.D.The idea, also generally known in England as block teaching, has begun to spread. It has been adopted in the last few years in some form or another, and for all or some students, by the University of Suffolk, Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Plymouth, De Montfort University in Leicester and UA92 in Manchester, a school cofounded by Lancaster University and former members of the Manchester United football club for people from disadvantaged backgrounds who might otherwise not go to college. It's also being used in Sweden and Australia.Many students like the strict pathway that allows them to stay on track to graduation. That's something being tried by a few universities in the United States, too, where students can find themselves drowning in choices. That situation is only getting worse as schools have added tens of thousands of new programs in an effort to attract more students, who end up with more credits than they need to graduate and spend more money on and time in college.U.S. students at four-year universities, on average, accumulate 15 credits more than they need to graduate, and at community colleges, 22 credits more, according to the advocacy group Complete College America.A less intimidating way to get a degreeHaving to learn a crush of subjects simultaneously was among Ashkan Bahgozen's fears about going to college while balancing the job of managing his family's café. ""I was very intimidated about courses overlapping,"" he said. He just wanted to get a degree.That's a surprisingly widespread sentiment among CU Coventry students.""You can focus"" on your principal discipline, said student Mabel Makombore, who is studying accounting and finance after having previously started and never finished a degree in fashion, business and marketing at a more traditional university in London. ""You're not going backward and forward and mixing things up.""Her classmate, Monika Myslewska, 33, added: ""My main advice is, don't go to university right out of school. Wait until you know what you want to do.""CU Coventry is not for everyone. Around 30% of this school's first-year students drop out before the second year, a spokesperson said. (The figure is misleadingly high because it includes the number who enroll and never start.) Still, that's lower than the combination of first-year students at U.S. universities who drop out or don't show up.One reason may be that many college students want to explore topics outside of their majors. But the CU Coventry model, Kinchin said, frees students from having to find their own way through endless numbers of electives, and keeps them focused on the end goal.""When students start off, they might be less confident. But by the time they finish, they're quite confident,"" she said.That's Bahgozen's story. ""If you met me four years ago, I was a shy, quiet kid,"" he said. Back then, he had to take ""access courses,"" the equivalent of remedial classes in the U.S., for students who don't meet college-level academic requirements. Now he's finished his degree in management and leadership with a ""first,"" or first-class honors, the highest level. He has begun a job in the United States for the Liverpool-based Everton Football Club's soccer schools.From the university's point of view, said Dunn, giving students choices ""adds lots of cost. Part of the expense of running a university is the complexity of timetabling and scheduling and personalizing that to the individual."" That makes CU Coventry's fixed format cheaper to provide.This doesn't mean that some administrators at the college haven't tried to raise tuition. That has happened at least once, Dunn said — during a management meeting he did not attend.""I behaved appallingly at the next management meeting,"" he said, ""and we brought the price back down.""This story about the cost of college was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

3165,UMass Lowell baseball coach resigns after racism investigation,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/25/umass-lowell-baseball-coach-resigns-after-racism-investigation,Coach Kenneth Harring's departure follows allegations of bias by a Black player,"Kenneth Harring, the head coach of the UMass Lowell baseball team, announced his retirement Monday after 19 seasons. His resignation comes in the wake of an allegation by a former UMass player that the coach had exhibited racist behavior toward him, as reported by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. The coach and the UMass Athletic Department denied the allegations made by Cedric Rose, a transfer student who made the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star team in 2022. Rose, who is Black, said he was cut from the team once Harring dicovered Rose was keeping track of what he described as the coach's racist comments in a journal.Instead, the department cited the 22-year-old Rose for aggressive behavior prior to the spring season this year. The school's athletic director, Peter Casey, accused Rose of violating ""the team expectations and philosophy document that all players are required to uphold” -- but he declined to clarify what that meant after GBH News sought elaboration.A subsequent external UMass investigation conducted by Worcester attorney, Brigid Harrington, determined in June that while Harring, who is white, may have directed harsh words toward a Black baseball player, the coach's behavior did not violate the school's policies on harassment and retaliation.Harring did not specifically mention Rose or the investigation in his resignation letter, which was published Monday on the official UMass Lowell Athletic Department website. But he did allude to the broader controversy. ""After some reflection, I have made the difficult decision to voluntarily resign my position at the university and move on to the next chapter of my career,"" Harring wrote. ""I wish to avoid being a distraction to the university and program that I am so proud of and that has been such an important part of my life for so many years.""Despite the investigation concluding Rose's dismissal was warranted, the school acknowledged that the coach's behavior was troubling.""Though the investigator found that no policies were violated, their investigation revealed interactions that do not align with the university’s commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment,"" the university said in a statement to GBH News in June.Rose's attorney Ed Burley said his client had documented the coach's alleged racist behavior in a series of notes that he kept in a diary. Burley and the family contend that the coach's discovery of Rose's journal is what led to Cedric being kicked off the team.Coach Harring's resignation is unlikely to put the brakes on ongoing litigation initiated by Burley and the Rose family.Burley told GBH News that they are in talks with UMass Deputy seeking compensation for the Rose family. He said they have also outlined several steps for ""reforming the UMass Lowell baseball team,"" including diversity training for the coaching staff and team and a public apology for the school's handling of Rose's complaints.",Local,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 08:05:26 EST",c1a0046724d2a4252985aa4d740923f0
446,Health care workers are burnt out. But who heals the healers?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/science-and-technology/2023/02/28/health-care-workers-are-burnt-out-but-who-heals-the-healers,"The pandemic pushed an already-understaffed healthcare workforce to its limit, but many feel they can't ask for help.","“Look for the helpers.” That's what Mr. Rogers says his mother told him in scary situations. Over the last three years, we've certainly had to look to — and seek help from — the helpers. It’s been physicians, nurses and all kinds of medical professionals who were the backbone of our society as a pandemic ravaged the world. But, where do the doctors look to? We expect them to be the strong ones in our society, but realistically, they're dealing with the challenges that the rest of us often face as well, like burnout or even imposter syndrome. Who helps the helpers? Who heals the healers? Dr. Gail Gazelle, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and author of “Mindful M.D.: 6 Ways Mindfulness Restores Your Autonomy and Cures Healthcare Burnout,” sat down with GBH’s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss how health care professionals can navigate healing themselves.Arun Rath: We did a show that I hosted for the first couple of years of the pandemic called In It Together, and I talked to a lot of medical professionals while things were especially crazy. Has anything gotten easier? Is there less stigma in terms of physicians and medical professionals seeking out help?Gail Gazelle: This is such an important topic — because levels of burnout in medical professionals were high pre-pandemic. And as we all know, the stresses on the health care system and medical providers were really phenomenal in the three years that we’ve seen in the pandemic. It would be wonderful to think that now that we’re at a different point in the pandemic, those stresses have decreased, but I’m not sure that’s the case. As we all know, the pandemic fueled the Great Resignation, and there are tremendous levels of understaffing of physicians, nurses, technicians, therapists. What that means is the ones who remain in the workforce are bearing the burden of all of that understaffing. Additionally, we’re in such a state of polarization in our society, aren’t we? The impact that that’s had on health care has also been unprecedented, like the levels of violence and threats towards members of the medical and nursing professions. All of this is bearing down on our already-weakened health care system, and I think the impact on physicians, nurses and others really cannot be understated. Rath: This is a new thing, right? There used to be a universal reverence — for understandable reasons — for people working in health care, people on the front lines. That just fractured in a way that it seems like it’s not going to heal. Gazelle: It’s a concerning time. Statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that injuries due to violent attacks on health care professionals went up 67% between 2011 and 2018. We don’t have better statistics than that currently, but one can imagine that those levels of violence — just like we’re seeing high levels of violence in other sectors of society — are increasing in health care, which really is a microcosm of the broader society that we live in in the United States. So I hope that we can talk a little bit about, well, how can we help health care professionals cope? How can we give them the skills that they don’t necessarily get in their training to weather all of the difficulties we’re seeing? Rath: Let’s talk about that. There’s been a whole new group of people who have become medical professionals in the last couple of years while all of this is going on. Are there resources for people to get the help they need so they can keep on?Gazelle: The good news is that there are more resources than there were even a decade ago. Unfortunately, in our medical training, we learn to always be the captain, to always have the right answer, to never show weakness and to never call in sick — heaven forbid. That’s something that I don’t know has changed significantly, and I think that’s an area where we can be training people in a different way. We can be training them that it’s perfectly normal to have vulnerabilities; that’s part of the human condition. So we really want to help physicians, in particular, to step away from that sense that if they seek help, if they see a coach, a mental health professional, etc., that somehow, that can be used against them. Rath: Is that changing now? Is there any kind of push to change that from the medical school level and up?Gazelle: There’s a tremendous focus now on wellness for physicians, everything from the American Medical Association to the American College of Physicians — really, to almost every professional society that physicians engage in — have turned an eye toward wellness. So I think that’s very hopeful news. How much of that has actually changed the patterns of medical training and medical school residencies and fellowships is unclear. I think there’s still room for improvement. You know, we used to think about the medical profession as somewhat of a dinosaur profession, that change really took a very long time. But I want to hold out hope that that type of change can occur because, again, the physician workforce is suffering, and we need to do everything that we can — as early in the career trajectory of the future physician as we can — to give them the skills that they need to weather all of the difficulties that are occurring in our health care system.Rath: I know that what you’ve looked at in your work has to do with long-term trauma, as well as short-term and immediate stresses. Talk about some of the particulars that people on the front lines in health care have had to deal with.Gazelle: I recall coaching a physician in New York City who was just burned out to a crisp, really wasn’t sure if he could go on in his career. He told me about all of the deaths that he was seeing, having to tell the husband of the mother of their teenage sons that she had died and that he hadn’t been able to save her from COVID. What was really interesting was that the physician wasn’t focusing on the good that he was able to do. In other words, his training had taught him that he was a failure if he couldn’t cure disease, or if he couldn’t heal or couldn’t increase longevity. His focus was on what he was not able to do, and that was really too much. He needed the sustenance of really focusing on the good that he was able to do. It also gives us a little bit of a clue of one action we can take to help decrease burnout and really restore that sense of meaning and purpose that all physicians deserve to have.Rath: That one action you mentioned is mindfulness, which you go into detail about in your upcoming book, “Mindful M.D.: 6 Ways Mindfulness Restores Your Autonomy and Cures Healthcare Burnout.” Can you talk a little more about that?Gazelle: You know, I think that when people hear the word “mindfulness,” they have an image of monks meditating on a mountaintop — and that certainly is part of mindfulness. Really, what I get at in my book and what I do with the physicians that I coach is really thinking about mindfulness as mental training, really learning how to become the master of one’s mind, as opposed to the captive. In that example that I just gave, mental training helped [the NYC physician] helped him shift his focus and helped him really be aware of where his mind was focusing, which was not helping him. So the mental training of mindfulness helped him step out of the kind of blinders that we can have when we’re in burnout when we don’t see the good that we’re doing.",Science and Technology,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:19:37 EST",b9198648ff2573bfc36c88b766a6ab61

In the statement, Thomas noted as the disclosure guidelines are now being changed, ""it is ... my intent to follow this guidance in the future."" Here's the statement in full:Harlan and Kathy Crow are among our dearest friends, and we have been friends for over twenty-five years. As friends do, we have joined them on a number of family trips during the more than quarter century we have known them. Early in my tenure at the Court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary, and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable. I have endeavored to follow that counsel throughout my tenure, and have always sought to comply with the disclosure guidelines. These guidelines are now being changed, as the committee of the Judicial Conference responsible for financial disclosure for the entire federal judiciary just this past month announced new guidance. And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future. [Copyright 2023 NPR]",National,"Fri, 07 Apr 2023 12:12:00 EST",51b8a4ad4a84504c6ba179490174b8f7
4929,Boston recognizes the African and Indigenous heritage of the first person killed in the American Revolution,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/03/05/boston-recognizes-the-african-and-indigenous-heritage-of-the-first-person-killed-in-the-american-revolution,"Earlier this week, Mayor Michelle Wu declared March 5 to be 'Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day'","For more than two hundred years, March 5 has been known as the anniversary of the Boston Massacre in the City of Boston. But on Sunday, the city marked the day as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day in honor of the man who is historically regarded as the first person killed by British shots on March 5, 1770. It’s a move that comes as the city aims to grapple with its own past and give a better picture of who Attucks was. At an event on Thursday announcing the official commemoration, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu remarked that the narratives of the day often portrayed Attucks as white, erasing his mixed African and Native American heritage. “Erasing the fact that a formerly enslaved man faced down British muskets for our nation’s freedom,” she said. “And erasing the historical fact that it was the courage of a person of color that stoked the flames of this revolution.”Wu said that the acknowledgement of March 5 as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day is in the spirit of the city’s new reparations task force, saying that that work must begin with a “recognition of the full truth of our history, the kind of truth on which meaningful healing and repair can finally be built.”The move was applauded by Haroon Rashid with the Friends of Crispus Attucks Association, who said at Thursday’s event that many historians have recognized Attucks’ contributions. “However, in the 21st century, few political leaders have publicly stated the importance of knowing that a man of African and American Indigenous descent became popularly known as the first to defy and the first to die for American independence,” he said. “And his name was Crispus Attucks.”On Sunday, at the Old State House, one program focused on the impact of the many forms of political violence from the state. Nathaniel Sheidley, president and CEO of Revolutionary Spaces, said that while they didn’t know that Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day would coincide with that programming when they were planning it, they have been trying to center Attucks in their telling of the Boston Massacre for a while now. He said that the commemoration is important not just for Attucks’ legacy, but for Boston. “I think that one of the challenges that we face as a city is to tell the story of our city’s role in the nation’s founding in a way that allows all of our residents to see themselves reflected in that story and to feel a sense of pride in it,” he said. “And Attucks is a really critical figure. He reminds us that Boston has always been a diverse place. And that people at all levels of our society have been contributors to our journey together across 250 years.”Sheidley also pointed out that while the city is officially recognizing a day to honor Attucks, the idea of a Crispus Attucks Day goes back all the way to the 1850s, when Black abolitionists chose to the use the anniversary of the Boston Massacre to make a statement about slavery. In the 20th century, the Boston Equal Rights League used the day to talk about the contributions of Black Bostonians and Americans. “And I think it’s important that we recognize that this moment of inflection, kind of official blessing of the idea of Crispus Attucks Day, is thanks to many who have been advocating for this for a long time,” he said. One of the speakers at the Old State House on Sunday was Charlot Lucien, founder of the Haitian Artists Assembly of Massachusetts. He said that there are a couple of reasons why recognizing Attucks is important. First, he said there is the imperative to acknowledge the contributions of Black people to the American Revolution. “So, had we erased Crispus Attucks in such a way that his name wasn’t known, his face wasn’t known, it would have been a missed opportunity for history and for the U.S. to embrace the richness of what happened in the U.S.,” he said. He also tied the violence inflicted upon Attucks to violence that has historically been inflicted upon Black people across the world.“And we need to relate a massacre in Boston to massacres that took place in other places and countries and states where Boston residents migrated from,” he said. “So, this interconnectedness that can be promoted through this should not be underestimated. It has value for Boston, it has value for Boston communities and for any other state or country that at some point relates to Boston through either migration, immigration or through history.”",Local,"Sun, 05 Mar 2023 20:23:39 EST",a746a677fa55619c581c2ce3286d6077
6325,Massachusetts’ system for migrant families seeking shelter approaches its breaking point,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/07/13/massachusetts-system-for-migrant-families-seeking-shelter-approaches-its-breaking-point,Boston Medical Center began turning some new arrivals away this week.,"Boston Medical Center changed its policy of serving as an ad-hoc safe harbor for migrants last week. Some local officials and advocates say they saw that change coming. Monique Tú Nguyen, executive director of Boston’s Office of Immigrant Advancement, told GBH News that city officials had worried that the hospital would not be able to sustain its efforts as demand on the state’s emergency assistance system kept increasing.“We were aware that they would have to start turning people away if it compromises their operation,” said Nguyen. “But we weren't sure of the timeline of when they were going to start that.”The number of migrants — including pregnant women and children — who have been arriving at Logan Airport is surging to levels the state is struggling to meet. Fleeing from violence and political turmoil in Haiti and South America, migrants often don’t know where to turn, and have sought out help in hospitals, police stations and local libraries. Even some migrants who arrived in Massachusetts months ago end up forced back into the cycle of uncertainty due to unstable housing conditions.Boston Medical Center, located in the South End, is one of the few places in the city that’s open 24 hours a day. It has sheltered hundreds of migrants for the past 18 months. But last week, hospital officials changed its policy to prohibit migrant families from staying at the facility unless they needed medical attention.Hospital President Alistair Bell said in an email to employees on Monday that the change was prompted after 131 people were sheltered at the hospital during a single night last week, with the majority not needing medical help.In the email obtained by GBH News, Bell said the number of migrants were affecting hospital operations and response to emergencies. Bell said the jump in numbers “occurred despite the state’s opening a temporary shelter for families at Joint Base Cape Cod, as well as a Welcome Center in Allston to link families to shelter.” He said the hospital appreciates the state actions but “unfortunately short and longer term shelter resources continue to fall substantially short in the face of this growing humanitarian crisis.”He added: “hospitals are not designed as a shelter.”Amid the recent crush, some migrants were directed from Boston Medical Center to Logan Airport, where State Police then worked with local organizations to find more suitable accommodation, according to Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan. “It makes no sense to me,” Mehigan said. “The airport is not an appropriate place to house families. We don’t have the resources.”Nonprofit Greater Boston Legal Services has fielded calls from BMC staff to help migrants navigate the emergency assistance system. “Boston Medical Center has been saying for a long time that they needed more help from the state and it just got too overwhelming,” said Liz Alfred, staff attorney for their housing division. “That's what I think happened: they didn't get enough of the help that they needed.” Alfred said that on occasion, BMC staff trying to get families help with the emergency assistance program meant “physically putting them into a cab and sending them to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.” She said there were times when “the office would just send them back to BMC” if they had an issue with their shelter application. The state and the hospital didn’t respond to questions about this scenario.There is no question that the situation is growing more urgent by the day. As a right-to-shelter state, Massachusetts is legally obligated to provide eligible families shelter through the Emergency Assistance program. Nearly 70 municipalities across the state are hosting families through the program, state officials say.The state doesn’t have an exact number for the amount of migrants flowing into Massachusetts, but each month, individual nonprofits have reported helping at least a few hundred people to GBH News. The shelter system had to expand each month since September of last year “in order to meet increased need,” according to a spokesperson for Gov. Maura Healey. Three weeks ago, the state activated the National Guard to oversee a facility for migrants at Joint Base Cape Cod. As of Wednesday, 54 families were residing there. “We have not occupied 60 units to date, but we do expect to in the future,” said Timothy McGuirk, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.Since late 2022, the governor’s Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities added more than 1,000 temporary hotels and motel units for use by the Emergency Assistance program. As of Wednesday, 1,226 migrant and resident unhoused families have been placed at sites statewide, according to state data. “Due to a critical shortage of available shelter beds and an increase in demand, the state has had to use hotels and motels as a temporary, last resort to ensure families have safe housing,” said Healey spokesperson Karissa Hand in a written statement.In June, the state opened the first welcome center for unhoused residents and migrants at the Brazilian Worker Center in Allston. Migrant families go through intake there, and if they qualify, can go to temporary housing. The state is in the process of onboarding Chelsea-based La Colaborativa as an emergency assistance provider.“The major challenge to getting people into the system is, I think, the fact that the EA system doesn't have enough space,” Alfred said. “They [the state] are desperately looking for places to put homeless families, no matter where they're from.” She said the challenge for migrants is proving their Massachusetts residency and having a place to stay while that process plays out.In response to a request from state Rep. Peter Durant, a Republican from Worcester, asking for the costs associated with housing migrant families, Healey’s office wrote that the “uptick of newly arrived families, coupled with “challenging housing market conditions” have resulted in a “sizable increase” of families seeking shelter in the Emergency Assistance system. State officials declined to answer questions about how much the state is spending on the 38 hotels and motels providing emergency shelter for migrant families across 28 municipalities. “As a consequence of this, the shelter system is strained,” Healey’s response said, “and we are struggling to not only find physical shelter space, but also shelter providers capable of efficiently and effectively connecting families with the robust services necessary for child and family health and well-being and long-term stability.”Boston city officials say they have stayed in contact with BMC throughout the yearlong process of migrant arrivals, and also helped 121 families in the past six months through its Office of Neighborhood Services.Boston contracts with nonprofit Neighborhood of Affordable Housing and other groups to help place into hotels in the short-term. Nguyen calls “stop-gap situations” to put people up for a couple of nights or a weekend, when they don’t have emergency assistance shelter. Nguyen says she doesn’t think the situation will remedy overnight, but says the state has plans to expand its emergency assistance system. “I have faith that it will smooth out over time,’’ she said, “especially as more organizations are resourced and stepping into the fold — that these uncoordinated moments will become less and less.”",Local,"Thu, 13 Jul 2023 14:20:28 EST",48cc1bf35938d0ff649d63452f32b6b1
4425,"To reduce childhood obesity, UMass Chan Medical School study finds community support is key",https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/05/15/to-reduce-childhood-obesity-umass-chan-medical-school-study-finds-community-support-is-key,Black and Hispanic children are at higher risk of obesity than their white peers.,"Obesity is a prevalent health problem for children in the United States. Nearly one in five children are affected by it. For Black and Hispanic children, that rate is one in four. Public health experts have given a lot of attention to the issue over the years, and one recent study by the UMass Chan Medical School has demonstrated some promising intervention techniques. The study was conducted among socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Worcester and had health workers meet periodically with parents to discuss their children's weight, diet and physical activity. Dr. Milagros Rosal, professor of population and quantitative health science and co-director of the Prevention Research Center at the UMass Chan Medical School, was one of the study's authors. She's also Imoigele P. Aisiku chair in health equity and diversity. She spoke with GBH's All Things Considered host Arun Rath about the research. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: Before we dive into the study, tell us a bit more about how big a problem obesity is among children today. I'm wondering if, as was the case with adults, it's been worse since the pandemic? Dr. Milagros Rosal: Well, yes, obesity in children has become a considerable problem and this is something that has been going on over quite a few years. As you mentioned, it did get worse with the pandemic. We have a crisis in this country and one that we should all be concerned about. Children are gaining excess weight. A large proportion of children, as you pointed out, especially children from minority backgrounds and children from under-resourced communities. Rath: Just on an individual level, what does obesity mean for a child? Rosal: That's a very good question and one that sometimes we don't think about very much. Obesity has tremendous consequences, some short-term and some long-term for the individual child, for the families, and society at large. At large, we are seeing more and more something we didn't see before, which is that now children are developing diseases of adults. Type two diabetes is one example of it. It used to be unheard of that a child would be diagnosed with type two diabetes, but now children as young as 9 and 10 years old are receiving this diagnosis. Obesity is related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, breathing problems like asthma, sleep apnea and joint problems. Children who are obese have a very high chance of growing up and becoming obese adults and then these consequences are obviously very serious. Obesity also has consequences for children in terms of mental health, depression, low self-esteem. They are more likely to be bullied. Their quality of life is compromised.And at a larger scale for society, the consequences are enormous. There is an increased cost of health care and low productivity associated with the inability to work and disability and, frankly, early mortality. Rath: So, tell us about the study, what it found about what techniques worked to fight this.Rosal: We developed this intervention with the help of parents and it consisted of two in-person sessions and two follow-up calls per year, over a period of two years, and these sessions were conducted by a community health worker. Community health workers are people from the community that understand the culture, can address issues of health literacy and can speak the language of the communities. We developed this intervention, and it was delivered by these community health workers in English and Spanish. The intervention sessions consisted of the community health worker talking with a parent or guardian of the child and coaching them, giving them brief advice about a healthy child weight and giving them key messages about reducing sugar-sweetened beverages, reducing high-calorie snacks, reducing screen time and increasing fruits and vegetables and physical activity. Then, the community health worker would ask the parents what goals they have for their kids in terms of health behaviors. They were able to define the goals and the community health worker would help them with making a plan to achieve that goal for their kids or for their families. And at the end of the session, the community health worker would discuss a plan for following up to see how the goal of the family and the plan to achieve it had worked out, and help with problem-solving any challenges. They had to understand what worked and what didn't, and why.Rath: It sounds like there's this whole suite of very specific, particular things that can be done and that work. Now, is it possible to scale it up so that could be used for many more parents and children? And what would it take to scale it up enough to have the impact that it should have? Rosal: Absolutely. And that is the beauty of this program, that it is a very simple program and relatively easy to implement and integrate by community organizations that may be interested in doing this type of work. There are many programs out there in the community to help families prevent obesity, and pretty much the intervention, as I mentioned, is delivered by a community health workers — somebody who can be trained from the community, who understands the community and understands the resources available. Part of what the plan involved was to help families identify resources for implementing their plan. For example, if it was increasing activity, what are the parks in the area where families could go and bring their kids and to participate in activities or to walk together? And it could be that the families needed food assistance and the community health worker would be able to help families with that. So, any organization that is interested in delivering this type of intervention would certainly be able to do that. It is not very complicated to integrate into an organization. Rath: Dr. Rosal, thank you so much. It's been great talking with you and nice to hear about solutions to a big health care problem. Rosal: Thank you very much.",Local,"Mon, 15 May 2023 15:09:47 EST",cbcde385527cbc2b66c1a0947d74ea2d

3555,Ask Dave Epstein: What's No Mow May?,https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2023/04/26/ask-dave-epstein-whats-no-mow-may,"It's a low-maintenance way to help pollinators, Epstein said.","Meteorologist Dave Epstein is our go-to person for pressing weather questions on everything from winter blizzards to summer droughts. He’s also a horticulturist, meaning he’s an expert in anything that grows leaves and flowers. GBH's Morning Edition asked our audience for weather and gardening questions, and Dave graciously answered them on the air. This transcript has been edited for clarity. Have a gardening or weather question for meteorologist Dave Epstein? Tweet him @GrowingWisdom, email us at thewakeup@wgbh.org, or text 617-300-2008.The idea behind No Mow May is to hold off on mowing lawns during the month of May, letting flowering weeds and other plants grow so pollinators can have an easier time finding flowers early in the season, Epstein said. “It started in the Midwest,” Epstein said. “The caveat here is if you've got all grass and you have one of those perfect lawns that you've been treating with chemicals and there are no pollinating things, then it doesn't matter.”Epstein mentioned creeping Charlie, also called ground ivy, a plant that produces tiny purple flowers that are perfect for spring pollinators. People usually consider it a weed, he said.“It's great for the pollinators but a lot of people are like, 'I don't want this in my lawn, I'm going to rip it out,'” he said. “And so they treat it. And now you've got just blades of grass, and blades of grass aren't good for pollination.”To sum it up: No Mow May has Epstein’s approval. “But you've got to have something to not mow, if that makes sense,” he said.The answer begins in photosynthesis, Epstein said. “One of the byproducts [of photosythesis] is sugar that's being transported from the leaves,” Epstein said. “It gets into the fruit. So the phloem [plant tissue that conducts sugars] is actually carrying the sugars into the fruit.”The sugars do not, in fact, originate in the fruit, Epstein said. But as the fruit ripens, the sugars inside of it are converted into different starches, he said. Because the ends of the fruit ripen first, and because much of the fruit found in local supermarkets is picked before it is fully ripe to preserve it until it can be sold, often only the ends have reached sweet, ripe starchy development. Yes, Epstein said. He uses seaweed in his garden, too. “It's a great way to tamp down weeds,” he said. “So in between my rows, I'll take some seaweed. We have a little cottage up in Maine, and so sometimes when I'm up there, I'll take a bag of seaweed.”There are also seaweed-based fertilizers available, he said. “Now, exactly how much and how you work it in, I would do a little bit more research on,” he said. “I wouldn't put a ton down because, you know, you could put too much of a good thing. But yeah, it's perfectly good in the garden and also great in compost piles.”Dave’s Growing Wisdom Tip: “Whether or not you have a big garden, do some things in containers. This is a great couple of weeks ahead, with cool and relatively damp weather. Lettuces, radishes, turnips, Asian greens, kales — all will be really happy planting in the garden right now.”",Local,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 13:27:41 EST",26ae362cfc60777491646d7dc7a9d438
