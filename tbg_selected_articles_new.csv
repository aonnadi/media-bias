"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Grzelcyk provides a spark,Defenseman's goal starts engine for BU,,"while freshman jack eichel led the way with a pair of goals, junior defenseman matt grzelcyk was responsible for getting the garden party started saturday night by scoring the first goal in boston university's dominant 5-3 victory over umass-lowell in the hockey east championship game. of course, bu's junior captain from charlestown had eichel to thank for that.","""that was a good job by jack,"" grz­elcyk said, tipping his cap to eichel, who was selected to the all-tournament team and was the hands-down winner of most valuable player honors. with 27 seconds elapsed in bu's first power-play opportunity, eichel retrieved a long pass from goaltender matt o'connor and drove the puck deep into the attacking zone along the right boards. eichel drew several defenders and threaded a cross-ice pass to grzelcyk, who beat umass-lowell goaltender kevin boyle with a backdoor shot at 13:08. it was all the terriers needed to crank up the party. ""obviously, jack made a great play,"" said grzelyck, who was also an all-tournament selection, along with o'connor. ""i saw the guy who was supposed to be on me was kind of paying a little bit more attention to [eichel] and so i just tried to go to the net and just hit the guy's stick right to my tape."" grzelcyk, who also was credited with an assist on nikolas olsson's second-period goal that made it 4-1, returned the favor by assisting on eichel's second goal at 14:43 of the third. it extended grzelcyk's career-best point streak to 11 games, a span in which he's had nine goals and nine assists. ""i don't think i was really playing any differently,"" said grzelcyk. ""obviously, i was getting a little more puck luck. my teammates had been finding me really well and i was trying to find the areas where i'm available and always ready to take a shot. ""that's something coach [david quinn] has always taught me, to always have your stick ready. i think that's something i've been really conscious of going into the game."" it was a banner night for the terriers at td garden, where grzelcyk's father john has worked for 45 years as a member of the bull gang. he proudly watched his son take twirls on the ice with the beanpot trophy and now the hockey east tournament hardware. ""it's always nice to be back here and seeing familiar faces and just talking to my dad before the game,"" grzelcyk said. ""i'm not really sure where he was [watching from]. i don't like to ask because then i'll get too distracted."" selected by the bruins in the third round of the 2012 nhl draft, grz­elyck laughed when asked if he was prepared to lobby bruins general manager peter chiarelli to move heaven and earth to draft eichel. ""obviously, i've had the pleasure of playing with him at the world juniors last year and this season, so if i could get to play with a player like that, i think that would be unbelievable,"" grzelcyk said. ""it'd obviously be a huge advantage. it would be cool."" even cooler still, would be the opportunity for grzelcyk to play with eichel in the frozen four in boston and capture the ncaa championship. ""obviously it would be huge,"" grzelcyk said. ""it would probably be a little bit of an advantage for us if we got back here. we've had a lot of success this year, especially here."" michael vega can be reached at vega@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],544,Copyright 2015 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-9e4e92aa-d02e-11e4-a5ca-0887e9624424,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '22', 'month': '03', 'year': '2015'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001589', 'className': 'WINTER SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009IRB', 'className': 'SPORTS AWARDS'}], 'city': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Osaka needs a rally to get by Muguruza,,,"melbourne — so good for so long lately, naomi osaka was just 1 point from the end of her lengthy winning streak, 1 point from leaving the australian open with a loss to garbiñe muguruza. bleak as things looked for her late in a big-hitting matchup of grand slam champions and former no. 1-ranked women, osaka never wavered, erasing two match points and grabbing the last four games to edge muguruza, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, at rod laver arena in the fourth round sunday. the third-seeded osaka returns to the quarter­finals of a tournament she won in 2019 for one of her three major trophies. osaka ran her winning streak to 18 matches — a run that included a us open title in september — and put a stop to muguruza's own fine form of late.","body heading into sunday — the second day of the tournament without any spectators, because of a local covid-19 lockdown — two-time major champion muguruza had been broken only once in this australian open. she had dropped a total of 10 games through three matches. but osaka broke her five times and won 17 games in all in a contest featuring entertaining baseline back-and-forth play and terrific serving by both on a cloudy day with the temperature in the mid-60s. ""i was a bit intimidated, because i knew that she was playing really well coming into this match,"" osaka said. ""in the stressful points, i feel like i just had to go within myself. and i know that today i probably hit a lot of unforced errors, but i feel like it was what i needed to do, because i couldn't really give her any short balls because she would finish it."" osaka wound up with more unforced errors, 36-28, but also more winners, 40-24. the key moment came when osaka was serving at 15-40 while trailing, 5-3, in the final set. muguruza could not convert either of those match points: osaka delivered one of her 11 aces at 118 m.p.h. on the first; muguruza missed a groundstroke on the second. fifteen minutes later, the match would be over. muguruza served for the win in the next game and was broken when osaka smacked a cross-court forehand winner to close a 14-stroke exchange. after holding to go up, 6-5, osaka broke muguruza yet again to win their first head-to-head meeting. osaka, a 23-year-old who was born in japan and moved to the united states with her family when she was 3, now faces unseeded 35-year-old hsie su-wei of taiwain with a semi­final berth at stake. ""i'm not really looking forward to it,"" osaka said. ""she's going to be really tough."" serena williams returned to the australian open quarterfinals by getting past no. 7 seed aryna sabalenka in three sets. the 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 victory put williams one step closer to her record-tying 24th grand slam title overall and eighth championship at melbourne park. her most recent major trophy came at the australian open in 2017. this was williams's 62nd fourth-round match at a major tournament — and saba­lenka's second. they played a similar brand of powerful tennis but williams was barely better, stealing the last two games after what had been a 4-1 lead in the final set evaporated. the 71st-ranked hsieh's 6-4, 6-2 victory over 2019 french open finalist marketa vondrousova made her the oldest woman to make her major quarterfinal debut in the professional era. this is hsieh's 38th main-draw appearance at a grand slam tournament. hsieh plays with an unusual style that includes two-handed shots off both sides, and that might have flustered the 19th-seeded vondrousova, who made 31 unforced errors, 13 more than the winner. hsieh beat 2019 us open champion bianca andreescu in the second round. on the men's side, daniil medvedev finally worked out how to a win a five-setter. the fourth-seeded medvedev was 0-6 in grand slam matches that went to five sets, and his australian open third-round match against no. 28-seeded filip krajinovic looked as if it was going all the way. after some angry outbursts from an increasingly animated and chatty medvedev directed at his box in an otherwise empty rod laver arena, his coach, gilles cervara, got up and left. ""he said just before leaving that he's sure i'm going to win the match. he's going to leave me alone to be more calm,"" medvedev explained in his on-court tv interview after saturday's 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-0 win.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,Britain warns Libya on Lockerbie bombing anniversary,Advises against celebration of Megrahi release,,"edinburgh, scotland - britain's government says it has warned libya that any celebration of yesterday's anniversary of the release from jail of the lockerbie bomber would be deeply offensive to the families of the victims of the attack, most of them from the united states. abdel baset al-megrahi, the only person convicted in connection with the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 above lockerbie, scotland, was ordered in 2001 to serve 27 years in jail, but was freed on aug. 20 of last year on compassionate grounds because he has prostate cancer.","meanwhile, the obama administration asked yesterday that megrahi be returned to a scottish prison. john brennan, president obama's counterterrorism adviser, told reporters accompanying the vacationing leader that the united states has ``expressed our strong conviction'' to libyan officials that megrahi should not remain free. brennan criticized what he termed the ``unfortunate and inappropriate and wrong decision,'' and added: ``we've expressed our strong conviction that megrahi should serve out the remainder - the entirety - of his sentence in a scottish prison.'' in a statement urging libya to show restraint, britain's foreign office yesterday described the bombing, which killed 259 people and 11 on the ground, as the ``worst act of terrorism in british history.'' before megrahi's release from a scottish jail, doctors said he would probably live only for three months. yesterday marked the first full year of megrahi's freedom. many families are outraged at the hero's welcome he received as he returned to libya, and his continued longevity. ``particularly on this anniversary, we understand the continuing anguish that megrahi's release has caused his victims both in the uk and the us. he was convicted for the worst act of terrorism in british history,'' the foreign office said. ``any celebration of megrahi's release would be tasteless, offensive and deeply insensitive to the victims' families. we have made our concerns clear to the libyan government, including through representations by the uk ambassador to libya.'' the decision to release megrahi was made by scotland's government, rather than the british government in london. prime minister david cameron, who at the time was opposition leader, condemned the move. ``the government is clear that megrahi's release was a mistake; both the current prime minister and foreign secretary made this clear at the time,'' the foreign office statement said. first minister alex salmond, the head of scotland's government, said this week that he stood by the decision. ``i think i'd rather be first minister of a society with too much compassion than be first minister of a country with too little compassion,'' he said. in washington, secretary of state hillary rodham clinton condemned the release of megrahi, issuing a statement that said the united states ``continues to categorically disagree'' with scotland's decision. ``as we have expressed repeatedly to scottish authorities, we maintain that megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in scotland,'' she said. four democratic senators - kirsten gillibrand and charles schumer of new york and robert menendez and frank lautenberg of new jersey - have called on scotland's government to release all medical records they hold on megrahi. scottish authorities have refused, citing patient confidentiality. scottish and british officials have also declined requests to offer testimony to a planned senate committee on foreign relations hearing on the case. some us legislators have expressed concerns that oil giant bp - seeking better access to libyan oil fields - may have pressured officials to approve megrahi's release, a contention strongly disputed by ministers in scotland and london.",['ENGLISH'],628,Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-GUA1KNS64.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '21', 'month': '08', 'year': '2010'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Environmental Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'International Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D170', 'className': 'BOMBINGS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Terrorism'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDlBOEIwQjg0OTdFNEFDQUJCRkZBMEZCNTJDMTlEQTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY', 'className': 'Terroristic Acts'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009EOQ', 'className': 'PRIME MINISTERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000093', 'className': 'ANNIVERSARIES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N928120MM', 'className': 'STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A4J3', 'className': 'JAIL SENTENCING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009U58', 'className': 'HISTORY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUIzQ0NGRDZERUU3NERCODg2MEZFMDI2RTI0RTA3RTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Sentencing'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001930', 'className': 'CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ', 'className': 'The Presidency'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N928120JM', 'className': 'EMBASSIES & CONSULATES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000417', 'className': 'COUNTERTERRORISM'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'STX001417', 'className': 'PROSTATE DISEASE'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'STX002115', 'className': 'PROSTATE CANCER'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DB9W', 'className': 'JOHN O BRENNAN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009WI7', 'className': 'DAVID CAMERON'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJP', 'className': 'BARACK OBAMA'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE000A0HY', 'className': 'ALEX SALMOND'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJO', 'className': 'HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'GX285', 'className': 'EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'GC676', 'className': 'SCOTLAND'}, {'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}, {'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC350', 'className': 'LIBYA'}, {'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",G,Living Arts,Beth Soll turns the spotlight on herself in a return visit,,,"cambridge - when dancer/choreographer beth soll left boston in 1997, it was a real loss to the area's dance scene. for 26 years, she enlivened boston culture with engaging, thought-provoking dance works that cut a distinctive path. but every now and then, soll and her new york-based company return to give us a little taste of what she's been up to. saturday night's concert at the dance complex featured a world premiere and two boston premieres.","the concert opened with two solos by soll herself, reinforcing her reputation as an extraordinarily compelling, articulate performer. ``disclosure'' (2010) was a powerful portrayal of an aging diva. with her turbaned head and gathered satiny skirt, soll was an elegant norma desmond type, reliving moments from a storied life in and out of the spotlight. as she walked, ran, lunged and skittered about the stage, gestures evoked a panoply of emotions. hands framed her face, clutching, covering. one arm cocked behind the head in a glamour shot. arms raised upward in a great curve, as if basking in applause, then dropped dramatically, casting it all aside. her period gazes to the audience were unnervingly direct. yet at one point, she fell, scrabbling backward and shielding her eyes from a bright sidelight, as if fleeing fame's glare. repeatedly she engaged, walking toward us resolutely before turning her back and taking a few steps away, as if she couldn't quite make the break with her adoring fans. ``tribute,'' given its world premiere, seemed almost a kind of prequel, though more internal and set to a flurry of spoken phrases, fractured and flowing forth in a variety of languages. she rushed onstage, adjusting the red belt of her dark gray coveralls, huffing ``i'm so tired, uno momento.'' she seemed to be talking more to herself than to us, urging, reassuring, censoring herself through bursts of activity with flourishes of dramatic gestures. it was like watching the process of creation. ``yes, no, basta'' she conversed with herself. ``ok. here goes'' launched a little hoochie-coochie dance, hips waggling side to side. ``just watch this'' ushered in slavic folk dance. it was riveting, humorous, and touching as she vaulted from moment to moment in a kind of creative frenzy. ``restless geometry'' (2010) was much less coherent. a work for seven dancers set to music from the 17th and 18th centuries juxtaposed with the sounds of frogs, crickets, birds, and wolves, it seemed to suggest how quickly civility can dissolve into savagery. balletic tendus and courtly bows cast in symmetrical patterns were subverted by chaotic runs and falls. ``life is a game. let's play,'' one of the dancers suggested, setting up freeze tag, catch, blind man's bluff. odd man out was accompanied by gossipy whispers, the fun taking on an edge of malice. the music invited dance, but most rhythmic phrases got quickly skewed by melodrama. at one point, the dancers dropped to their knees, hands behind their backs. they mimed taking turns beheading one another, then fell into nurturing embraces. in the end, one lone dancer costumed in green was encircled by the others. to the sound of frogs croaking, he curled on the floor, then slowly crawled forward to arise upright, as if to remind us we've all emerged from the swamp. karen campbell can be reached at karencampbell4@rcn.com dance review beth soll & company at: dance complex, saturday night",['ENGLISH'],566,Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-GG21MQ523.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '14', 'month': '12', 'year': '2010'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D8ZU', 'className': 'DANCERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009UJY', 'className': 'DANCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CYZY', 'className': 'CHOREOGRAPHY'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009VC0', 'className': 'ARTISTS & PERFORMERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D8ZU', 'className': 'DANCERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '58', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}]}"

,SPECIAL SECTION; Pg. B2,,USA: sales superpower;,,,"dubai, united arab emirates - sleek fighter jets made in the usa glimmer on a desert tarmac while american top-gun pilots hover like car salesmen. courting oil-rich sheiks and princes, the pilots enthrall the royalty with war stories from desert storm. this is the dubai air show, where the glitter of marketing meets the drab-green reality of war. it is a six-day extravaganza that is the third world's largest showcase of the latest high-tech weaponry. ""these things can fight, we found that out,"" gulf war hero eric dodson boasts to a group of emirates' royalty viewing the merchandise. with $ 5 billion to spend, they are in the market for 80 fighter jets.","an emirates air force commander among the entourage seems in awe of the decorated american pilot. as dodson swaggers out to the f-16 fighting falcon, he waves the commander up into the cockpit. flanked by marketing experts from the manufacturer, lockheed martin, the two men climb into the jet and get down to business, going over the weapons-delivery system. when the royal entourage leaves, a lockheed martin technical representative sprays the cockpit with a can of glade air freshener and spit-shines the windshield. and the sales team waits for the next customer among scores of countries - from jordan to indonesia. in this climate of the hard sell, america's arms industry - backed by president clinton and his defense and commerce departments - has gone from 13 percent of the pre-cold war global market to about 70 percent today. in the seven years since the collapse of the soviet union, america has emerged as the world's leading exporter of conventional weapons. this cascade of american jet fighters, tanks and missile systems has raised profound foreign policy questions. the specter of us weapons fueling regional conflicts looms worldwide. even more troubling is the increasing likelihood that these weapons - developed using public funds in the name of national defense - could be used against us troops. these concerns rise out of a fierce fight for survival by the world's arms manufacturers amid a worldwide downturn in defense spending. in other words, it's a buyer's market, and us manufacturers are in it to win. state department officials justify the push to export as a way to help crucial allies, such as saudi arabia and turkey, protect themselves from the demonstrated aggression of so-called ""rogue states,"" like iraq and iran. but it's not traditional foreign policy that's made america dominant in exports, rather it is a domestic economic strategy by the clinton administration. washington has funneled subsidies to the industry to facilitate exports, arguing that foreign sales keep us procurement costs down and jobs at home. but while leading defense manufacturers report big profits, surging stock prices and huge increases in compensation for top executives (an average of $ 3.5 million a year for the 10 biggest companies), there has been no visible sign of reduced costs to the military and the hemorrhaging of american jobs continues. to secure deals, thousands of production jobs often are shipped overseas along with the weapons. critics argue that us arms export policy is misguided and dangerous, eroding the industrial base of the economy, spreading advanced weapons technology and generally making the world a more dangerous place. international figures, from pope john paul ii to nobel peace laureate oscar arias sanchez, condemn the greed of the arms industry and folly of third world leaders for plunging their nations deeper into poverty by buying advanced weapons. but with a democrat in the white house driving the policy in the name of jobs and a republican congress squarely behind it in the name of big business, there is a disquieting absence of debate over a policy some liken to a runaway train. ""the brakes are off the system,"" warns lawrence korb, a former assistant secretary of defense appointed by president reagan at the height of the us arms buildup and now a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington. ""when we armed our surrogates during the cold war it was a defensible position. you could also argue, with the collapse of the soviet union, that the policy succeeded. but now there is no coherent policy on the transfer of arms. it has become a money game: an absurd spiral in which we export arms only to have to develop more sophisticated ones to counter those spread out all over the world. . . . it is a frightening trend that undermines our moral authority in the new world order. it is very hard for us to tell other people - the russians, the chinese, the french - not to sell arms, when we are out there peddling and fighting to control the market."" larry smith, former counselor to defense secretary william perry, sees ""real dangers to this policy."" ""they are dangers that are taking place on unmapped terrain. it is one of the major issues of security for the next ten years,"" he says. ""the problem is, it's a very hard one to navigate. to say that we should not sell any weapons abroad is impractical and unrealistic. to continue exporting weapons without a coherent strategy is also ill-advised. it is a problem that needs the country's attention. unfortunately, it is not getting it."" no one disputes that the us drive to become the leading supplier in the $ 40 billion world arms market has achieved its goal. consider the following: - in the four years prior to the end of the cold war, 1986-1989, the us exported $ 34.5 billion in arms, according to the us defense security assistance agency. ""foreign military sales,"" a federal program of government-to-government transfers which are among the most well-documented arms transactions, puts total exports for the four-year period 1991-1994, at $ 83.1 billion, an increase of 140 percent. - last year, for the first time in history, american companies produced more fighter jets for export than for the us military, according to a study by the cambridge-based institute for defense and disarmament studies, which tracks international arms transfers. the same holds for many lines of missiles and tanks. - before the collapse of the soviet union, us weapons accounted for about 13 percent of government-to-government transactions worldwide. the us now controls as much as 64 percent of the global market, according to a defense depart-ment report titled ""world wide conven-tional arms trade: a forecast and analysis."" these figures, though dramatic, probably underestimate us dominance of the global arms market because they reflect only government-to-government sales. they do not include ""direct commercial sales,"" which are negotiated directly between manufacturers and foreign governments and not as well-documented as government-to-government transfers. lora lumpe, director of the federation of american scientists' arms sales monitoring project, says these types of transactions have surged in the last decade because the industry prefers their more private nature and minimal red tape. direct sales, the federation's figures show, can account for as much as $ 6 billion a year. she says the most solid indicator that us dominance will continue to rise is that american manufacturers in 1993 obtained 73 percent of total arms agreements - government and commercial sales - which will be delivered and paid for in the coming years. a potent partnership  the federal government and the defense industry have been allies in the fight for supremacy. joel johnson, vice president of the manufacturers' chief lobby, the aerospace industry association, doesn't mince words about the aggressive campaign: ""if you look at other markets, like medical instruments, supercomputers, et cetera, the us has 70 to 80 percent. the question isn't why do we have so many exports in the aerospace market; the question is why have we had so little?"" defense department officials defend the exports as part of a ""two-way street"" - helping allies to develop conventional forces compatible with america's, while shoring up the domestic economy and keeping defense costs-per-unit down. although the defense department budget increased from $ 263 billion last year to $ 265 billion in 1996, the money earmarked for procurement has shrunk from a high of about $ 80 billion annually in the mid-1980s to a steady $ 45 billion a year today. since the government is buying fewer arms, analysts say, exports have become a crucial, government-subsidized profit-making venture for an industry in transition. with the collapse of the soviet union and scaling back of the reagan defense buildup, president bush tried to cushion the economic blow. he began by waiving ""recoupment fees"" of 5 percent to 25 percent levied against american manufacturers on sales to foreign governments. the fees were intended to reimburse the government for the billions of dollars in subsidies it provides for research, development and testing. ""in effect, the foreign sales are all gravy for the industry,"" says korb, the former assistant defense secretary. ""exports look like a small part of the overall industry, but they are a very high concentration of the profits."" for example, the government spent $ 1.9 billion since 1979 for research, development and updates on the amraam missile. after nine production cycles for us armed forces, the advanced missile is now a leading export for raytheon. the lexington-based company sells them on the international market for $ 275,000 apiece and has a current export order of more than $ 100 million. waiving the recoupment fees on these kinds of systems ""has amounted to a massive subsidy of hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the arms industry; it is corporate welfare at its worst,"" says lumpe. other assistance comes in more direct forms. the clinton administration, for example, has provided the arms industry with $ 36 billion a year in research, development and testing grants. that is about 50 percent more in inflation-adjusted dollars than the us was spending in the 1970s, according to the washington-based military analysis network, a non-profit group that tracks defense spending. a more direct subsidy to the export market is the pentagon's $ 3.5 billion a year ""foreign military finance"" program, which gives money to friendly nations for arms purchases. underwriting mergers  mergers in the industry also have been subsidized. the federal government provided approximately $ 1 billion in support for the $ 10 billion merger last year of lockheed with martin marietta, industry analysts estimate. the pentagon chipped in to help cover consolidation costs, mothballing plants, severance packages, even ceo bonuses. the defense department says the consolidation and ""streamlining"" of the industry will result in future procurement savings. ""the secretary of defense has said that mergers are inevitable if these companies are going to stay viable,"" says department spokesman glenn flood. ""it's too early to say or to quantify the savings, but in the long run we expect them."" what is certain is the loss of jobs, in the case of lockheed martin, 19,000 by the end of this year. another form of subsidies is loan guarantees. in the gulf war, for instance, the united states forgave $ 7 billion in military loans to egypt. the government even helps pay for marketing presentations and technical assistance at trade exhibitions. at the dubai air show in november, for example, the pentagon paid $ 500,000 to transport and display 13 us military aircraft - from lockheed martin's f-16 to bell's ""super cobra"" attack helicopter. an estimamphasize regional stability through standardization and interoperability with our equipment and the allies throughout the arabian gulf market. and, quite frankly, we are putting our hardware on display because it's the best in the world and we're proud of it."" in huge air-conditioned auditoriums, prospective buyers saunter by pavilions marked us defense department and us commerce department as if they were storefronts at a shopping mall. the us army booth has an enticing video presentation with a hard-rock beat and a voice straight out of fm radio promoting mcdonnell douglas apache attack helicopters: ""anytime, anywhere, any weather death awaits in the dark."" as the announcer speaks, tanks on the ground burst into flames. the air force booth takes the customer-friendly approach, featuring a large framed board devoted to ""our foreign military sales customers"" with a long list that includes turkey, egypt, indonesia, pakistan and thailand. this hard sell by the federal government is one of the most disconcerting developments of the post-cold war era, says william keller, former director of congress' office of technology assess-ment and author of ""arm in arm: the political economy of the global arms trade."" ""it is a pretty straightforward idea that market forces should not drive the arms trade: political and strategic concerns should,"" he says. ""this is not rank idealism by liberal do-gooders. it is a practical concern to prevent weapons of mass destruction, and the technology to build them, from spinning out of control."" since president eisenhower first warned to beware the ""military-industrial complex,"" economists have cautioned that the country is dangerously reliant on the business of weapons. today, the industry accounts for 2.1 million jobs nationwide. in new england, there are more than 200,000 workers - from the high-tech raytheon plant in andover to the enormous electric boat shipyards of groton, conn. the broader sphere of research and development provides support for the region's academic community, from massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge to the university of massachusetts at amherst. seven years after the end of the cold war, the us economy still seems unable to break its dependence on defense. spending is down from the unprecedented reagan-era budgets of more than $ 300 billion to $ 265 billion this year. but the downturn has not yielded a ""peace dividend."" adjusted for inflation, the defense budget today is at the level it was throughout most of the 1950s, the last half of the 1970s and 1980, according to the washington-based center for strategic and budgetary assessment. at the current level, the us spends three times more on defense than any other nation. russia spends $ 80 billion. iran, iraq, libya, north korea and cuba spend $ 15 billion combined. this tends to raise questions about the military establishment's assessment of the potential threat from abroad. a matter of foreign policy  the clinton administration's candor in citing ""economic concerns"" as a motive for pushing exports marks a historic shift in american policy. what is a domestic policy for clinton, was a foreign policy for his predecessors. the nixon doctrine first enshrined the idea that it was easier and more lucrative for america to sell weapons to allies in the third world than go rushing in to defend them against communism. the us, nixon believed, should facilitate such deals. president carter, who supported the arming of allies, fundamentally disagreed with using the government to assist in sales. within three months of his inauguration, carter ceremoniously wrote what the industry dubbed the ""leprosy letter,"" which instructed us embassy staffs to have nothing to do with ""the merchants of death."" then there was president reagan, who from his first days in office set out to build up the domestic defense industry. however, the us still had a relatively small share of the global market, less than 15 percent on average. the soviet union was the largest exporter of weapons at the time, with as much as 60 percent of the world's trade. today those numbers are reversed, with clinton providing ""the most aggressive executive support of foreign arms sales since richard nixon,"" according to william hartung, author of a new book titled ""and weapons for all,"" which traces exports from the end of world war ii. in 1992, candidate clinton initially talked the talk of a liberal democrat wanting to control the arms trade. but during the fall campaign, action in the foreign export market grew fast and furious. there were big arms deals that meant a mother lode of jobs in key states such as michigan, texas, missouri and ohio. and bush worked diligently to clinch them. he began by announcing his support for the $ 9 billion sale to saudi arabia of 72 f-15 eagles made by mcdonnell douglas. (in addition to the saudi contract, there were 150 f-16 fighters to taiwan and 236 general dynamics m-1a2 tanks to kuwait and many commercial contracts as well.) mcdonnell douglas led an industry consortium public relations campaign called ""us jobs now,"" generally seen as the first step in the push to change the nature of the arms sales debate from foreign and military policy to domestic economic concerns. with glossy brochures, videos and newspaper advertisements, the company made dire predictions that if the saudi sale did not go through, it would result in ""layoffs of 40,000 workers"" and end production of the f-15. with his ""new democrat"" support of big business taking shape, clinton surprised the bush campaign by eagerly endorsing the saudi and taiwan deals. the challenger was making it clear that he, too, would be an aggressive advocate for the arms industry. the high-pressure public relations campaign of ""us jobs now"" worked, and the saudi sale was approved. mcdonnell douglas clinched the contract, then laid off about 14,000 workers in the following three years. the marketing of arms exports as crucial to the domestic economy changed an axis of american politics. the old notion that conservative republicans traditionally sided with the arms industry and liberal democrats typically called for constraint was out the window. ""the problem is that the issue is now viewed only in very parochial terms,"" says paul nke, former head of the arms control and disarmament agency under president carter. ""congressmen don't want to lose jobs in their districts. defense companies see the profit in exports. . . . the export boom just becomes one last, desperate attempt for the industry to cash out."" an active promoter  clinton's pledge to support the industry is a campaign promise he has more than kept. the president has carved out new roles for some cabinet secretaries as de facto salesmen of american weaponry. he has dispatched defense secretary perry and commerce secretary ron brown on an unprecedented number of trade missions - from the paris air show to the middle east - to drum up business for the arms industry and ensure that deals go through. the commerce department even set up an ""advocacy center"" to coordinate a broad effort to increase american competitiveness in many exports, including arms. the center has established what it calls a ""war room,"" where economists strategize on how us companies can clinch deals. and working just behind the scenes, industry sources say, is the central intelligence agency, which often assesses the competitive strategies of other foreign manufacturers which may be vying for the same markets. john richards, head of the com-merce department's office of strategic industries, is responsible for 33 full-time employees and a budget of $ 2.3 million focusing on international arms deals. ""a few years ago, we realized that the us (defense) industry was going to lose a great deal of business,"" says richards. ""we knew we had to capture a higher percentage of exports. . . . but the heaviest focus on this strategy came when secretary brown came in. . . . now, whenever secretary brown visits another country, we are asking him to meet with their secretaries of defense. . . . we have to do everything we can."" brown declined interview requests. clinton's policy was spelled out in presidential directive 41, signed last february, which states that arms sales are a necessary part of the policy to preserve industrial jobs and keep down the cost of production of weapons. it also ordered the diplomatic corps to become ""actively involved"" in ""promoting sales."" raymond mabus, us ambassador to saudi arabia, which purchases billions of dollars of american arms every year, is doing just that. ""a big part of my job is to help put americans to work by selling products overseas, and that definitely includes the defense industry,"" he says. ""i don't think it is our job to tell the saudis what to buy. but once the decision is made, it is our job to do everything possible, and legal, to make sure they buy american."" besides continuing bush's policy of not collecting recoupment fees for direct commercial sales, clinton has waived some fees in government-to-government sales. an all-out repeal of government-to-government recoupment fees has been a legislative priority for arms industry lobbyists, lumpe says, and one which the clinton administration has endorsed to ""level the international playing field."" in exchange for its support, the clinton administration has drawn effusive praise from the arms industry. ""we've all been pretty pleasantly surprised by clinton,"" says john mikels, vice president of hughes' missile systems division, which developed the stinger, tomahawk and most of america's advanced missile systems. ""we have seen a significant turnaround, a realization that to keep the production alive they are going to have to actively help the industry in seeking out export markets. i would say it is a dramatic turn in the industry. and it's just in time."" but clinton's policies have disillusioned some members of his administration. ""if we don't show leadership now, we will get involved in simply chasing arms sales behind countries that are already selling arms to anyone,"" says joseph smaldone, chief of the weapons and technology control division of the us arms control and disarmament agency. ""unfortunately, we're heading in that direction."" former high-ranking military officers also have weighed in with sharp criticism. jack shanahan, a retired vice admiral, former senior adviser to the joint chiefs of staff and ambassador to nato, sees america's arms export policy as ""fundamentally misguided."" ""i don't think people realize that during the cold war, the us government never urged the defense industry to market its products overseas,"" says shanahan, a self-described ""cold war-rior"" who heads the center for defense information, a washington-based nonprofit group of former military officials. ""i don't think people understand that during that time, the transfer of weaponry was based on strategic concerns. now it is based on greed on the part of the industry, and the false promise of keeping jobs back home, when in fact they are often transferring the jobs overseas right along with the weapons. this is a very disturbing development, and one that has gone by the american public with very little debate.""  a guide to arms in the past, the us has maintained military superiority by exporting only weapons that were older and less capable than those used by its own forces. defense and intelligence officials warn against the spread of high-tech weaponry, but exports now include some of the more advanced aircraft in the us arsenal. globe staff chart / s. mcnaughton",['ENGLISH'],3886,Copyright 1996 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '02', 'day': '11', 'year': '1996'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009X46', 'className': 'DESERT STORM'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000805', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001141', 'className': 'MILITARY WEAPONS'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'STX000752', 'className': 'FOREIGN POLICY'}, {'score': '85', 'classCode': 'ST00098A0', 'className': 'FOREIGN RELATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001514', 'className': 'SALES FORCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A4QF', 'className': 'COLD WAR'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CM', 'className': 'AIR FORCES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001814', 'className': 'WAR & CONFLICT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000464', 'className': 'DEFENSE SPENDING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009ESS', 'className': 'DEFENSE SECTOR PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Armed Forces'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000459', 'className': 'DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJW', 'className': 'PRICES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST00097CC', 'className': 'COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001150', 'className': 'MISSILE SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0008X90', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING OUTPUT'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000951', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL TRADE'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002237', 'className': 'FIGHTERS & BOMBERS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njc5NTU5QUM5NkU4NEJEMzk3NTBCOThDODc0MDhBODU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc0QkUxRjIwOENFNDFFM0IyRjk2QzZCRjNCMjkwODU', 'className': 'Pilots'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000111', 'className': 'ARMS TRADE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000463', 'className': 'DEFENSE INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001141', 'className': 'MILITARY WEAPONS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N336400CC', 'className': 'AEROSPACE INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CM', 'className': 'AIR FORCES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000462', 'className': 'DEFENSE ELECTRONICS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000464', 'className': 'DEFENSE SPENDING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009ESS', 'className': 'DEFENSE SECTOR PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Armed Forces'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000459', 'className': 'DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001150', 'className': 'MISSILE SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0008X90', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING OUTPUT'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009VXO', 'className': 'BILL CLINTON'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST0009TXV', 'className': 'DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES'}], 'country': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC354', 'className': 'UNITED ARAB EMIRATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC328', 'className': 'TURKEY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC358', 'className': 'IRAQ'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC305', 'className': 'INDONESIA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC335', 'className': 'SAUDI ARABIA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC370', 'className': 'JORDAN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC368', 'className': 'IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Ortiz believes he'll fit like a glove,,Gordon Edes Globe Staff,"world series denver - david ortiz noticed it as soon as he got to the ballpark yesterday afternoon, the therapeutic effect this 103d world series is having on his aching right knee. and it had nothing to do with the venue switching from sea level to a mile high. ""two and oh,"" ortiz said. ""it feels great.""","ortiz will be at first base tonight in coors field for the resumption of the world series between the red sox and colorado rockies, the sox within two wins of their second series title in four seasons, the rockies hoping to draw inspiration, and craft at least a couple of wins, in a place where they had the majors' best home record after june 1 (39-15, .722). daisuke matsuzaka, buoyed by his victory in game 7 of the american league championship series, will face josh fogg, the rockies righthander who was born in lynn, mass., but whose family moved to south florida when he was two weeks old. fogg was 10-9 with a 4.94 era, numbers that hardly suggest he's the ideal choice to be on the barricades against a team batting .309 in a dozen games this postseason. ""the run has taken its place,"" rockies manager clint hurdle said, alluding to colorado's 21-1 resume that the sox ran through the shredder in fenway park the previous two nights, ""and now we've run into a situation where we've lost two games. that's happened to us before also. a sense of urgency has never hurt this ball club."" sox manager terry francona, forced to make some lineup alterations by national league rules that prohibit the use of a designated hitter for the next three games, announced that kevin youkilis will sit, ortiz will grab a glove, and mike lowell will remain at third base. with youkilis out of the no. 2 hole in the lineup, francona plans to have rookie jacoby ellsbury lead off with dustin pedroia dropping one spot, ""though i reserve the right to change my mind over dinner,"" the manager said. ortiz took ground balls at first during yesterday's optional workout. he played just seven games at first this season and did not commit an error. he made two errors in 10 games at first in each of the last two seasons, four in 31 games in 2004. that included three games here in 2004, in which he did not commit an error. ""i played first base not bad,"" he said. ""gold glove caliber."" the sox are giving away something defensively by not having youkilis, who has gone 190 regular-season games since his last error. ""people making such big a deal about me playing first base,"" ortiz huffed good-naturedly. ""it's not a big deal. anything around me is going to be caught. anything else, i don't know."" and ortiz had a ready response when someone mentioned that it didn't look like he was running great when he scored the deciding run on lowell's double in the sox' 2-1 game 2 triumph thursday. ""i never look great running,"" he said with his trademark smile. ""but i'm all right, though. i'm all right."" youkilis could hardly fault the logic of having to yield to ortiz. ""i'd love to play,"" said youkilis, whose nine-game postseason hitting streak ended when he went 0 for 3 with two walks thursday. ""as a manager, i don't think i take david out of the lineup."" francona took no pleasure in sitting youkilis, whose .396 average is second among postseason participants. but for now, the best the manager can offer him is employment as a defensive replacement late in the game if the sox have a lead. ""i think people are making more of this than it is,"" youkilis said.

""i believe you can pitch well in this ballpark,"" said lowell, whose years in the nl gave him a better read on this place than most of his sox teammates.

,SPORTS; Pg. 37,,Courting new viewers,,,"those among us with celtic memories extending further back than darren daye may recall that during its e. ellis (woody) erdman stewardship, the franchise was so destitute, airlines and hotels routinely refused it credit. the current management cavalierly plunks down multimillions for the television station where ""mcmillan and wife,"" ""columbo"" and ""private benjamin"" have gone to die. i mean, channel 25 has never been in what you might call the cathode ray playoffs. welcome to the '90s. that, in fact, is what celtics chairman of the board don gaston said yesterday while announcing the team's purchase of the station. he's going to put all his road games on his own station, and he thinks you'll see a lot more of this in the future.","teams have formed cable stations. you've got the red sox and nesn, the lakers and prime time, and a few other examples. but this is the first time a professional sports team has purchased a ""free"" tv station for the purpose of producing its own telecasts. obviously, messrs. gaston, alan cohen and paul dupee think this is an eminently logical business proposition. it's all heady stuff if, like me, your biggest exposure to the business world was a kool-aid stand in front of your house when you were 10. people keep telling us that the worlds of athletics and entertainment are becoming indistinguishable. who can doubt it now? the players may not know it, but the boys up top already have those aftra applications in the mail. the time is past when celtics players, coaches and management personnel can justify their salaries solely by playing basketball. imagine the look of channel 25 programming a year from now: 7:30 casting with kevin who needs gaddabout gaddis? fishing (and hunting) enthusiasts can tune in for the next 10,000 weeks as kevin mchale takes viewers on a tour of each and every one of his home state's lakes. see lucky contestants vie for prizes by taking jump hooks at special floating backboards. 8:00 mr. rodgers' neighborhood the pilot's a pip. mr. rodgers is a new head coach. a couple of games into his inaugural season, his best player goes down for the year. after the draft, he goes off on a peaceful vacation in the woods with his brother and friends to unwind. no phone. no beeper. totally incommunicado. he comes home after a week to find out that his prize rookie point guard has accepted a million-dollar offer to play in italy. yeah, it is unbelievable, but they figure if you'll buy a 16-year old doctor, you'll buy anything. 8:30 jurisprudence with jan each week, celtics general manager jan volk is presented with a hypothetical sports law case that he must clarify for the masses by using the greatest number of polysyllabic words and compound-complex sentences. 9:00 hello, larry the once-shy hoosier has blossomed sufficiently to host his own talk show. guests on the first program will include moses malone (get ready for the banter on the '81 playoffs) and bill laimbeer. larry bounces one-liners off a guffawing rick robey, who loves to reminisce about his favorite sneakaway dunks and steak dinners. a special feature will be the alumni corner, one of the highlights being garfield smith's animated discussion of his famed 1970 air ball hat trick from the free throw line in phoenix. 10:00 arnie's angst he used to coach the team, and he remembers when it was a simpler world. he also was the general manager, the traveling secretary, team psychiatrist and accountant. he didn't know from assistants, and all he did was win every year. now they've got about 18 people to do what he once did. he goes to the league meetings and all they talk about are luxury boxes, balance sheets and audience shares. he's disoriented.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",MAGAZINE,,TRIPLE THREAT,"EVEN AFTER FEAK ACCIDENTS, HEALTH SCARES, AND BAD FALL, SHE'S STILL GOING STRONG AT 44. NOW, AS A MOTHER OF TWO, WORLD-CLASS TRIATHLETE KAREN SMYERS HAS BECOME AN EXPERT ON MANAGING ITME, MAINTAINING ENERGY, AND FINDING MOTIVATION", BY DOUG MOST ,"she was so proud of herself. karen smyers, 18-year-old freshman at princeton university, walked up to the school's track coach and told him she wanted to join the team. and why not? as a high schooler back in connecticut, she had starred in tennis, gymnastics, and swimming, so how hard could running be? ""i said i could run 3 miles - without stopping,"" smyers says now, laughing at her naive boldness. ""the coach smiled and said, `when you can run for an hour, come back.'"" an hour, she thought. who runs for an hour straight? with that challenge was born the career of one of this country's greatest female endurance athletes. smyers, who lives with her triathlete husband, michael king, and two children in lincoln, would eventually build up to that hour - after the first time, she recalls, ""my body was screaming in agony"" - and then she just kept right on going, mixing running with her favorite sport, swimming, and her least favorite, biking, to become a world-class professional triathlete.","there have been plenty of bumps along the way, from a bike crash that broke her collarbone to a brush with a semi that left her with broken ribs and a lung bruise, to a sliced hamstring caused by a shattered window, to a bout with thyroid cancer. but she's used each not as an excuse to slow down but as motivation to speed up. now smyers is 44 and training daily for what will be her 10th ironman world championship in hawaii this october. she won the event in the women's professional category back in 1995 and finished fifth in 2001. last year, her ninth-place finish earned her $7,500 in prize money; she completed the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run in 9 hours, 30 minutes, 47 seconds (the winner took home $110,000). in her other roles - as mom to 2-year-old casey and 7-year-old jenna and as a motivator - she coached a team of runners for tomorrow's boston marathon, and she will lead a few hundred children, including her daughter, in the third annual lincoln kids triathlon this july 4 weekend. so most kids dream of playing baseball or soccer or football or basketball professionally, but triathlons for a living? i loved sports. i remember days in the summer when i would have swim-team practice in the morning, then gymnastics, then i'd ride my bike home for lunch, and then bike back to do tennis. that's the swim-flip-pedal-whack. how about your first swim-bike-run? it was 1984. i came to boston after college to do computer consulting and joined the irish american track club. a roommate told me about this event, the harvard women's sprint triathlon. it was an 800-meter swim, 8-mile bike, and 3-mile run. i loved the idea of a challenge. i was in good swim shape and run shape. i won it. you won your first triathlon? there's an omen. i decided to try an olympic distance - 1,500-meter swim, 10k run, and 25-mile bike. i did one in upton, and that's when i realized there are people here who have been doing this awhile. after that i did the bay state triathlon, which was a 1-mile swim, 40-mile bike, and 10-mile run. i came off the bike in third place and caught [1981 boston marathon winner] allison roe in the run. that's when people came up to me and said i should do this professionally. so did you start training harder? most days i would bike to work, about 4 miles, then i'd ride to mit to swim on my lunch break, and then i'd run after work. i remember heading off to jog and everyone else was heading off to happy hour. but i started combining socializing with working out. it makes it more fun to combine working out with going out. when did you decide to make this a career? in 1989, my company went half time in the summer. i trained a lot more. i worked on my weakness - biking. i'd go out for a 2-hour ride in the morning. then my company went bankrupt. i finally had time to train. not many people celebrate when their company collapses. [laughing.] it was the best thing that could have happened to me. for those of us whose companies don't seem to be in danger, what advice do you have if we want to exercise vigorously? figure out what time slots you can commit to training. for most people, that means getting up early. some people can get in a lunchtime workout. but i also tell people there are no absolutes. some days it might be better for you to sleep in. you need sleep, too. and there are going to be times when a spouse might be irritated that your workout is eating into family time. you have to recognize that. but it's also part of your quality of life, it's not something you should feel guilty about - well, maybe a three-hour bike ride. it's a good role model for kids. if they see you working out, they'll want to do that, too. and stay-at-home moms need time to themselves, to feel good about themselves. what do you remember about your first ironman, in 1993? i went to hawaii to watch it one year, and i remember being surprised that it wasn't just a suffer-fest. they were really racing it, not just surviving it. the switch was turned on for me then. i remember doing my first 100-mile bike ride and collapsing afterward and thinking there was no way i could run a marathon now. i couldn't take another step. but eventually i worked my way up. in the [1993] race, i was fine in the swim, but i couldn't wait to get off the bike. in the run, by mile 8, my legs were jelly. i stopped at a water station and took a coke, and it was like a shot of adrenaline. i grabbed a coke at almost every stop after that. that was 13 years and a score of ironmans ago, and in the meantime you've had two kids and recovered from thyroid cancer. how did those things affect your training? when i hurt my hamstring, i can feel that, i know what's wrong: the muscles have torn apart, and they need time to fuse together. but i couldn't feel my cancer. that made it hard. getting back to exercising was a way of building my confidence in my body again. it was a real boost to my attitude. even when i couldn't bike or run, i would still go out and walk. and getting sideswiped on your bike by a tractor-trailer near your home - that had to change how you train. i've always been a cautious rider. he was trying to pass me in a no-passing zone and knocked me off the road. after that, i changed the roads i ride on and changed the times i go out. during commuting time, you notice drivers are a little more impatient. i try and go out when drivers have a little more patience. also, i'm even more defensive, assuming drivers will do the worst. and if i didn't have my helmet on, it would have been much worse. but it has to be hard to get motivated after so much time off. exercise is not something i view as a luxury or a chore. exercise is part of my life. it's not a question of if i can run again, but when. there are two types of personalities: those who have to get motivated to get out the door and others who go out even when they're injured. that's probably not smart. i take advantage of the extra time i have at home to spend more time with my kids. over the years, have you noticed that new people have started training and racing? i definitely see more older people jogging. the older age groups at races are filling up a lot more and getting more competitive. that's true of the road races, but lots of people hate jogging. pick another sport. indoor soccer. some people like games instead of individual sports. a game is still exercise. or do a bike tour - make it more than just grueling exercise. there are so many things you can do as a family, even as simple as a family bike ride. personally, i like the grueling exercise. and yet you've never done the boston marathon. you afraid of a little 26-mile run? it's always conflicted with my spring triathlons, when i can kick off the season earning some prize money. but as i get older, i am starting to do events more for pure enjoyment. that's on my list.",['ENGLISH'],1308,Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,604110236,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '16', 'month': '04', 'year': '2006'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,Poland reconsidering rights treaty,,,"the polish government, emboldened by a narrow election victory this month and undeterred by criticism from european union leaders, is considering withdrawing from a treaty aimed at curbing domestic violence and protecting women's rights, with the country's minister of justice filing paperwork monday to start the process.","body the move came just one week after eu leaders, bowing to pressure from poland and hungary, relaxed demands that were supposed to tie funding in the bloc's long-term budget to issues related to rule of law. in the days since, both warsaw and budapest have pressed ahead with agendas that critics say compromise judicial independence, media freedom, and gay rights. poland's plan to pull out of the domestic abuse treaty is likely to face stiff resistance, however. the mere suggestion that the government wanted to withdraw prompted thousands of protesters to take to the streets over the weekend and led the council of europe, a human rights organization with 47 member countries, to express alarm at the prospect. the treaty, known as the istanbul convention, is intended to combat violence against women in europe. conceived more than a decade ago, the treaty has been caught up in a maelstrom of disinformation and populist rhetoric, cast as a threat to national sovereignty and twisted by conspiracy theories and smear campaigns. the convention has been targeted by far-right and nationalist leaders across east and central europe and has become a totem in the battle against what they portray as the too-liberal influences of western culture. although the treaty does not address issues of gay rights, opponents have claimed that the treaty promotes ""lgbt ideology"" and poses a threat to christian morality.new york times",['ENGLISH'],323,Copyright 2020 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-d2ca2f6ad03e11eaa1d7576233170ea4,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '28', 'month': '07', 'year': '2020'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'International Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUU0MTkxNTgyRjJBNEY1NzkxMkU4NTIzODBBNTA4RDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTI3NjUxRTJFQkZENDgwREFDODlEQTc4MDkyOTJENkQ', 'className': 'Domestic Violence'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D73F', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D89F', 'className': ""FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS""}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNAL', 'className': 'GENDER BASED VIOLENCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ', 'className': 'Human Rights'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001758', 'className': 'TREATIES & AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000777', 'className': 'GAYS & LESBIANS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D4NX', 'className': 'LGBT RIGHTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVT', 'className': 'ABUSE & NEGLECT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE', 'className': 'Free Press'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Civil Rights Law'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N813311MM', 'className': 'HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000949', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CYCH', 'className': 'LIBERALISM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DFNA', 'className': 'RULE OF LAW'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX140', 'className': 'BUDAPEST, HUNGARY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX260', 'className': 'WARSAW, POLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC361', 'className': 'POLAND'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST00099QF', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC357', 'className': 'HUNGARY'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Cell samples to go,Boston firm finds new homes for unused materials from research labs,,"kerafast helps research teams find biologic materials they need, like the cell culture at right. chinchilla tissue samples millions of tiny tubes of cells, proteins, antibodies, and other scientific goo sit in freezers at research institutions across the country. these leftovers of past lab experiments can languish for years, frozen and forgotten. now a boston company called kerafast inc. is helping institutions clean out their freezers and reuse biological materials for new research through an online marketplace, a sort of craigslist for biologists. since kerafast began its service in 2010, more than 2,000 researchers around the world have used the company's website to search the freezers of 112 research institutions, buying unique biologic materials created in experiments by other scientists.","annie huhn, a research fellow at dana-farber cancer institute, recently spent $250 for a line of cells on kerafast that helped her with her work studying proteins. ""they have materials that you're definitely not going to find anywhere else,"" huhn said. robert p. bondaryk, a biochemist by training and veteran of the biotech industry, hatched the idea for kerafast six years ago. ""this is gold in freezers that many institutions are sitting on,"" said bondaryk, the company's chief executive. ""let's take what's in their freezers and make money from it."" a year after its launching, kerafast had signed up 10 institutions. this summer, the company hit a milestone when it enrolled its 100th research institution, adding to a list that includes boston children's hospital, massachusetts institute of technology, the university of massachusetts, and harvard university. most of the biologic concoctions kerafast sells look like clear liquids to the naked eye. but scientists see much more: raw materials for research that could lay the groundwork for discoveries of life-changing drugs to treat cancer, alzheimer's, and many other debilitating diseases. the products offered on kerafast's website are divided into different research areas, such as cancer, stem cells, immunology, and neurobiology. click on cancer, and you get a list of dozens of ""featured products"" — myriad varieties of cells, antibodies, and more —for sale. each item comes with a short description that includes the name of the scientist who created it. prices range from $65 to more than $6,000 per product. the average order is about $500. kerafast ships the products quickly, packed in dry ice, from one lab to another, sometimes around the world. thomas fazzio, assistant professor of molecular medicine at umass medical school in worcester, needed a certain type of antibody, a protein the immune system produces to fight harmful substances, for his work with stem cells. he contacted a lab in california, but did not hear back for weeks. he did not want to try developing the antibodies on his own, because the process would have taken months and cost thousands of dollars. a google search led fazzio to the kerafast website, where he found the material he needed for about $300. ""we can buy it one day and get it the next day, as opposed to begging somebody else for it,"" fazzio said. kerafast splits its sales revenues with the research institutions that supply its inventory. bondaryk initially established the company as a nonprofit, with a mission to provide a new source of revenue for institutions at a time when federal support for research was waning. but he switched to a for-profit model because it allows kerafast to charge more for products and allow research institutions and the company to earn more. kerafast handles all the administrative work required to sell its products, including the legal agreements, which are necessary because the biologic materials are considered intellectual property. this is helpful especially f or smaller research institutions, such as brandeis university in waltham, where staff do not have the time or resources to seek out new homes for their surplus materials. ""we're a really small tech-transfer office. i don't want to get bogged down in red tape,"" said rebecca menapace, associate provost at brandeis. bondaryk estimates there are as many as 1 billion tubes of bioresearch materials sitting in freezers across the united states. every day, he tries to add a few more of these materials to his website, where scientists can access them. ""our approach is to take any material and try it out,"" bondaryk said. ""the downside is maybe something doesn't sell, but the upside is you discover stuff you never thought anyone would want."" cells for sale the kerafast website featured these ""new additions"" tuesday: priyanka dayal mccluskey can be reached at priyanka.mccluskey @globe.com.",['ENGLISH'],812,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-00ff07aa-4f41-11e4-8e57-56cd8e4da473,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '22', 'month': '10', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009RLP', 'className': 'RESEARCH INSTITUTES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FT1', 'className': 'AMINO ACIDS, PEPTIDES & PROTEINS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001964', 'className': 'SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000248', 'className': 'CANCER'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000186', 'className': 'BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008Z8M', 'className': 'BIOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N541710QQ', 'className': 'MEDICAL RESEARCH'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FY9', 'className': 'EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FXU', 'className': 'BIOCHEMISTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001248', 'className': 'ONCOLOGY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D8KZ', 'className': 'NEUROSCIENCE'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000079', 'className': ""ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE""}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8W', 'className': 'GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX002099', 'className': 'GENETIC & MOLECULAR MEDICINE'}, {'score': '51', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X66', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001248', 'className': 'ONCOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000249', 'className': 'CANCER DRUGS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N622310GM', 'className': 'CANCER HOSPITALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001895', 'className': 'BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001829', 'className': 'WEB SITES'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8W', 'className': 'GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}], 'city': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D274', 'className': 'WORCESTER, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}]}"

Newspapers,LIVING;,,A BRUTAL REMINDER OF GENOCIDE IN RWANDA,,By Matthew Gilbert Globe Staff ,"why make movies about history's most epic failures of humanity, reducing them to some 120 minutes of melodrama, suspense, and tear-jerking? the question has haunted so many holocaust films, with their portrayals of ez-to-read heroism set against heart-rending strains of klezmer.    hbo's rwanda-set ""sometimes in april"" clearly articulates the best answer after its final credits, with the simple phrase ""never forget."" translating the horrors of genocide into fictional stories is a way of embedding them in our cultural memory. about the 1994 murder of some 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus in rwanda, ""sometimes in april"" stands as an important remembrance, a cinematic antidote to the denial that comes with time and ignorance. the movie, which premieres tomorrow night at 9, is a brutal, depressing, dramatically flawed, but essential reminder.","      april is the start of the rainy season in rwanda, and it is also the month that hutu extremists began their calculated slaughter in 1994. as bullets begin to rain down on terrified families, the african nation fell into a hell virtually ignored by the rest of the world. the panoramic ""sometimes in april"" tries to capture the 100 days of murder and rape from all points of view, including rwandans living deep within the bloody conflict and a well-meaning american bureaucrat (debra winger's deputy assistant secretary of state) who's helpless amid washington indifference. ambitiously, the movie aims to encompass the personal and the political angles. but its strongest material is its intimately told personal story, about two rwandan brothers on different sides of the battle.    augustin (idris elba) is a peaceful hutu army general married to a tutsi woman, jeanne (carole karemera). as april 1994 dawns, he desperately tries to move her and their three children to safety, since they've become walking targets. honore (oris erhuero), on the other hand, is an incendiary dj on a hate radio station who provokes hutu listeners to kill their tutsi neighbors, commonly referred to as ""roaches."" in the atmosphere of growing chaos, honore's broadcasts provide an important unifying and informational tool to the loose army of genocidal killers.    too obviously, honore is meant to be symbolically responsible for the sad fate of augustin's family. but the gentle dialogue from writer-director raoul peck, and the soulful performances by elba and erhuero, nicely muddy the moral waters. elba, from ""the wire,"" is particularly impressive here, as he bears the emotional weight of the movie on his still face.    the action toggles between 1994 and 2004, when honore is standing trial at the united nations tribunal in tanzania. he is pleading guilty to war crimes, and clearing his conscience, and so he invites augustin to come visit him in prison. still grieving over his losses, unable to move forward with his life, augustin reticently takes up his estranged brother's invitation. together again across a prison table, they define a decade of disaster and pain.    ultimately, ""sometimes in april"" succumbs to schematic plotting. having brothers representing two sides of a coin is convenient enough; adding in a few more heavily emblematic relationships strains the believability of the fictional story. the identity of augustin's girlfriend, which i won't reveal here, is one of the twists that seems unnecessarily contrived. in an atmosphere of messy street violence and anarchy, the movie's story line is too neat.    and peck's portrait of the lack of us intervention comes off as simplistic. whether his take bears truth isn't the issue; it's the cursory way he mixes it into his fiction with a handful of news clips and scenes of winger's character fretting. how the un dealt with or didn't deal with the rwandan genocide is a movie of its own, and not just the peripheral drama in an otherwise powerful tale.     matthew gilbert can be reached at gilbert@globe.com.   ",['ENGLISH'],655,Copyright 2005 Globe Newspaper Company,BGLOBE-0503180092,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '18', 'month': '03', 'year': '2005'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'ST0009S69', 'className': 'GENOCIDE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D9R3', 'className': 'ETHNIC CONFLICTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001814', 'className': 'WAR & CONFLICT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY', 'className': 'Murder'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU4', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CV', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIxQTU1MkJBMEY1NDY4MDhBODUxRTJBNjVCREFDRDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhBNEU2OUVGMEJGNDQzNUFEODk2MUY5QTRFMThCQjU', 'className': 'Tribunals'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkE0QjE5NTNFNjk2NDMzRjlGQkNBNUVDN0IzRURCMkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI', 'className': 'War Crimes'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001826', 'className': 'WEATHER'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CN', 'className': 'ARMIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DMQO', 'className': 'MEMORY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DMYZ', 'className': 'EMOTIONS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc', 'className': 'Sexual Assault'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFCRjAwOERDM0JGNDQ4QjhEODU0MDYxOUE3QUY2RjM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc1MDBENkU0ODJCNDQ5MzkxNEFERjkzQTYwODQzRDA', 'className': 'Guilty Pleas'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N515120CC', 'className': 'TELEVISION INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000A4UK', 'className': 'MOVIE RELEASE DATES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CN', 'className': 'ARMIES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DKRU', 'className': 'IDRIS ELBA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC554', 'className': 'RWANDA'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC383', 'className': 'TANZANIA, UNITED REPUBLIC OF'}]}"

,ECONOMY; Pg. A1 p,,Prime-time faceoff for big money;,,,"a hardball showdown over the megabucks from prime-time television could shift the uneasy balance of power between the three television networks and hollywood's major movie studios over providing entertainment to 120 million american homes. the prize could be the hundreds of millions of dollars to be made from the sale of prime-time television shows to other broadcast outlets here and abroad. but the cost might be further control of hollywood's creative process by the;networks, which have been blocked for years by tough government regulation. many writers and producers fear this homogenization might limit even further the already limited diversity and message of many tv shows.","in a last ditch attempt at compromise, robert daley, president of warner bros., the movie studio arm of time warner, conceded last week that the producers of product in california might agree to sell the networks in new york a financial interest in every show produced in hollywood.  as part of the bargain, though, daley, acting on behalf of a consortium of independent producers, unaffiliated television stations and movie studios, indicated the networks would be required, among other things, to absorb part of the deficits incurred in producing the programs, and would be limited in their scheduling of these programs.  this concession was recommended by independent programming producers, who are suffering because their weekly operating deficits are much greater than the weekly license fees from the networks, says jerry leider, who along with daley, is part of the hollywood negotiating team. the networks though, are not buying the concession. ""the studios want safeguards so overwhelming that it amounts to a straitjacket we couldn't accept,"" says a network executive familiar with the negotiations.  jack valenti, president of the motion picture association, the trade group representing the movie studios, says the offer of a financial interest is ""a breakthrough. but, they the networks want more. they don't want any rules at all,"" he says.  ""i'm really dismayed by the networks. they want to be totally competitive with the studios. they believe they can go before the fcc year after year and get what they want,"" adds valenti.  at issue is the right - now largely denied to nbc, cbs and abc - to produce more prime-time programming, to benefit financially from this ownership, and to sell these shows to tv outlets abroad.  the networks are prohibited from having a financial interest in more than five of the 22 hours of prime-time television - programs viewed between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. each night of the week, except for sunday night, when prime time starts at 7 p.m. what's more they can only sell these five hours of shows to television operators abroad and are not allowed to profit from the domestic syndication of any prime-time programs. these restrictions are about to be loosened, some wall street analysts, congressional specialists and network negotiators believe.  for one thing, the federal communications commission temporarily awarded fox broadcasting co., the television arm of rupert murdoch's news corp. global communications empire, a waiver in april, allowing it to act like both a movie studio and a television network, at least until the end of 1990. unlike the other networks, fox has the unlimited right to produce and syndicate here and abroad its own television shows, in which it has the controlling financial interest.  the move has encouraged wall street about the prospects of the networks.  ""there will be a modification that will allow the networks to produce 50 percent of their programs and allow syndication of this 50 percent,"" says alan kassan, a morgan stanley entertainment analyst.  this would mean the networks could produce and have a financial interest in 11 hours of the 22 hours of prime-time television, and control the distribution of those programs to their affiliates in the united states and to the fast-growing european market.  kassan also believes the potential rule change will facilitate the ""affiliation or merger of the three networks with the movie studios.""  preston padden, a fox senior vice president, says, however, that there is ""a perpetual prohibition in the consent decree against the networks having a financial interest. even if the fcc changes the rules for them they must go to court and modify it."" the final resolution of this battle depends, in part, on negotiations between the networks and the motion picture association, which will be renewed this week. if a compromise cannot be reached by thursday, the fcc will hold hearings to resolve the matter by year-end.  some independent movie producers are worried that if the networks get their way, they will become captives of three large buyers of entertainment product. ""the programming choices will be narrower because the perceptions will be narrower. the yardstick will be how much three gateway networks are going to make, rather than how good the idea is,"" says lillian gallo, an independent filmmaker in california, who once worked at abc.  the outcome of this battle also will affect the livelihoods of hundreds of independent television stations like viacom, the entertainment complex controlled by sumner redstone, a wealthy boston businessman.  cbs, abc and nbc want the chance to emulate viacom, which has grossed about $ 600 million from selling the hit cosby show, which originated on nbc, in reruns to independent television stations here and abroad. independent television stations also fear for their livelihood, even though many are part of the fox network or belong to paramount, disney, mca and the tribune co., publisher of the chicago tribune.  ""the viewers will be given less choice of programs if the networks can control the best shows, and warehouse them for network affiliate stations,"" says ed trimble, general manager of ktvt in dallas. ""we oppose any change at all.""",['ENGLISH'],993,Copyright 1990 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '06', 'day': '10', 'year': '1990'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Communications Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009T7B', 'className': 'MOVIES & SOUND RECORDING SECTOR PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009UV1', 'className': 'FILM'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX001704', 'className': 'TELEVISION PROGRAMMING'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N512110MM', 'className': 'MOVIE & VIDEO PRODUCTION'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N512107MM', 'className': 'MOVIE INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N515120CC', 'className': 'TELEVISION INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X6A', 'className': 'NETWORK TELEVISION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009T7B', 'className': 'MOVIES & SOUND RECORDING SECTOR PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A0ES', 'className': 'PRIMETIME TELEVISION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N512100CC', 'className': 'MOVIE & VIDEO INDUSTRIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N515000CC', 'className': 'BROADCASTING INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001098', 'className': 'MEDIA SYNDICATION'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009OZ7', 'className': 'MOVIES & SOUND RECORDING TRADE'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

""if somebody is going to take to heart a message to prevent hiv, and they act on it, they're going to be at lower risk for gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia as well,"" said etkind. while the overall numbers of teen-age births and std cases have dropped statewide, certain populations are still at high risk, causing continued concern for public health officials. for instance, hispanics have the highest teen-age birth rate, 121.6 births for every 1,000 women aged 15 through 19; for black non-hispanics, the rate is 90 per 1,000 women, and for asians, 32.7 per 1,000. while white non-hispanics have the lowest rate, 23.8 births per 1,000, they constituted more than half of all new teen-age mothers in the state. similar racial disparities exist in the std cases, but as mulligan pointed out, such differences may reflect socioeconomic status rather than race. but public health officials added that programs to prevent stds and teen-age births must be sensitive to language and cultural differences that exist. another public health report released yesterday, of fatal injuries at work in 1994, showed that the top four causes of death on the job remain the same as in previous years, although the rankings have shifted slightly. of the 62 men and 9 women who died as a result of injuries on the job in 1994, 12 died in motor vehicle crashes; 11 as a result of homicide, related to police duties or robberies of retail stores; nine as a result of falls; and nine from fishing and boating activities. in other action, the public health council voted to finalize a regulation implementing the new state law requiring most insurers to cover a minimum 48-hour hospital stay after a vaginal delivery and 96-hour stay after a caesarean section, unless women and doctors agree to an earlier discharge. the only substantive amendment to the regulation changes the hours during which hospitals cannot discharge patients, to between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. some women's health advocates wanted an expansion of the regulation so that certain providers, such as doulas, can make home visits to women discharged early. but public health officials said that change could not be made because the law as passed requires a physician, a registered nurse or a certified nurse-midwife to make the first home visit and a licensed health care provider to make any subsequent visits. doulas are women who come to the home a few hours a day to help new mothers with such skills as breastfeeding and to provide support by cooking meals or running errands.  a welcome drop in stds, teen-age births  figures released yesterday show a continued slide of sexually transmitted diseases.…",['ENGLISH'],685,Copyright 1996 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '04', 'day': '24', 'year': '1996'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'STX001557', 'className': 'SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000051', 'className': 'AIDS & HIV'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N923120CC', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000419', 'className': 'BIRTHS & BIRTH RATES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000022', 'className': 'ADOLESCENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001957', 'className': 'POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002058', 'className': 'DISEASE AGENTS & VECTORS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001997', 'className': 'UROGENITAL DISORDERS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000156', 'className': 'BACTERIA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001234', 'className': 'OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS & INJURY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000C47H', 'className': 'WOUNDS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001627', 'className': 'STATISTICS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001864', 'className': 'WORKPLACE HEALTH & SAFETY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX002145', 'className': 'VIRUSES'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'STX001004', 'className': 'LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
,EDITORIAL;,,FIRMER FOUNDATIONS,,,"philanthropy has an honest reputation that's being tarnished by the actions of a few greedy trustees and staff members who pay themselves far too handsomely. the massachusetts attorney general and prosecutors in other states are looking into evidence of abuse reported last month by the globe's spotlight team. among the subjects was paul c. cabot jr., who gave himself a raise to pay for his daughter's $200,000 wedding. cabot's salary hit a high of $1.4 million. during the same time period, the foundation donated an annual average of only $400,000."," this summer, researchers at the georgetown public policy institute pointed to similar problems in a report on trustee fees paid by large and small foundations. in 1998, the 238 that were surveyed paid $44.9 million in trustee fees. fourteen of the large foundations paid trustees more than $100,000 each. foundations have tax-exempt status because they contribute to the greater good. to survive and prosper, they need the public's trust. excessive compensation drains money away from charity and creates an intolerable stain for the many selfless trustees who work for little or no money. several things should be done. states should increase enforcement. in massachusetts, the attorney general's office is working with other states and the urban institute, a washington think tank, to develop software that can analyze foundations' tax forms. the challenge will be getting all foundations - in particular small ones with limited administrative resources - to submit this information in a form that software can read. and it will take human investigators to spot more deceptive practices such as funneling money to trustees by contracting with companies they own. more critically, the foundation community should police itself. the council on foundations, an association of more than 2,000 donor institutions, points out that self-policing is the one way to avoid ""uninformed, politically motivated scrutiny of foundations and philanthropy"" that could lead to damaging tax changes or regulations. the council should expand its outreach and education and promote honorable whistle blowing, encouraging board members or relatives to report abuses. while egregious cases should be prosecuted, some abusers would benefit from guidance in cleaning up messes and instituting best practices. the council has helped a dozen donors over the past seven years. this effort should be expanded. the internal revenue service has other pressing work. but a small increase in money and attention could buoy the work of states and associations. philanthropy's heart beats to put money where it can do the most good. this sector should have the cleanest accounts possible.",['ENGLISH'],459,Copyright 2003 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '11', 'day': '02', 'year': '2003'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000278', 'className': 'CHARITIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUQ4NThEMTk0MTQ4NDM3N0FGOEM5RkU2QUQ4RjA1MkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENGNTY0MEQ2RTU2NDA2NTk4QjcyNzI2NTBERUU3NUI', 'className': 'Trusts'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008XKB', 'className': 'PHILANTHROPY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Tax'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813211MM', 'className': 'FOUNDATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001677', 'className': 'TAX EXEMPTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009RLP', 'className': 'RESEARCH INSTITUTES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001960', 'className': 'PUBLIC POLICY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000175', 'className': 'BEST PRACTICES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEQ3QzNDQzE2OTlGNDhENjkxMEVGQjQ0QUZGQzFDQzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzdCMzU2REU0NThGNEFBNDg0NEYwMjExMjM4NDY5NDM', 'className': 'Collection Authority'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Evidence'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D1CF', 'className': 'WHISTLEBLOWERS'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Some Fidelity college savings plans now offer other companies' mutual funds,,,"fidelity investmentsis opening up some of its college savings plans by including other companies' mutual funds on its menu of investment options, rather than restricting investors to fidelity funds. boston-based fidelity, the third-largest manager of 529 college savings plans, unveiled the change yesterday. here are the basics:","background section 529 plans are named after part of the federal tax code. they let parents withdraw money for college expenses free of federal taxes. there are notable tax benefits for those going this route, compared with stashing the savings in bank accounts or certificates of deposit. each plan is sponsored by a state that can set its own guidelines, including offering tax deductions or credits. investors aren't limited to their own state's plan. open or closed? traditionally, 529 plans have restricted investment options to mutual funds from the company that is managing the plan. however, some 529s have adopted ``open-architecture'' approaches, where the investment menu includes funds offered by other companies that might deliver superior investment performance. open-architecture plans typically charge higher fees. who can participate fidelity's expanded menu is available nationwide in four 529 plans: fidelity arizona college savings plan, delaware college investment plan, massachusetts u. fund college investing plan, and new hampshire unique college investing plan. collectively, they manage $9.3 billion, or nearly 8 percent of all assets in 529 plans. the new options the outside funds investors in the fidelity 529 plans can now choose from are selected by fidelity. examples of funds with strong performance records include jpmorgan us equity, mfs international value, and pimco total return. plan portfolios typically hold a mix of funds that invest in stocks, bonds, and money-market investments. as a child gets closer to college age, the investment mix becomes more conservative. that shift reduces the potential for a big loss just as a student needs to draw from the savings. fees program fees and expenses associated with the new options run from 0.93 to 1.42 percent of plan assets. that's more costly than the 529 options that fidelity continues to offer using only in-house funds. fees and expenses range from 0.57 to 1.06 percent for a 529 plan option in which assets are invested in funds that rely on professional managers to pick investments. the range is 0.25 to 0.35 percent for 529s that invest in index funds which passively track market indexes. mark jewell writes for the associated press.",['ENGLISH'],425,Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-GB71RJ6C2.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '05', 'month': '10', 'year': '2011'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Insurance Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Tax Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000559', 'className': 'EDUCATIONAL SAVINGS PLANS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009P24', 'className': 'STUDENT EXPENSES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000CYBP', 'className': 'CONSERVATISM'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Tax'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001675', 'className': 'TAX DEDUCTIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N525910GG', 'className': 'MUTUAL FUNDS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001313', 'className': 'PERSONAL FINANCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N525110MC', 'className': 'PENSION FUNDS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000275', 'className': 'CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N525910MG', 'className': 'INDEX FUNDS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001160', 'className': 'MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000198', 'className': 'BONDS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",EDITORIAL OPINION,Editorial,Brandeis: Renting out art for art's sake,,,"brandeis university is raising eyebrows in the museum world with its plans to lend out artworks for money, but exploring this option is a reasonable way to preserve the financially strapped school's collection.","last year, brandeis considered closing the renowned rose art museum and selling off some of its 7,500 objects. had that happened, both the school and the region would have been worse off for it. now, the globe recently reported, the school is hiring auction house sotheby's as a lending broker. collecting fees from institutions that might want to display some of the museum's works could generate badly needed funding and might even increase awareness of the rose as well. the rose, like many other museums, owns more works than it can display. in the past, museums lent artworks to one another and charged mainly for the costs of shipping and insurance. but tougher times justify a more entrepreneurial approach. in recent years, a major atlanta museum paid $7 million to borrow works from the louvre. one can, of course, take the profit mind-set to an extreme: the museum of fine arts did just that in 2004, when it lent most of its monets to a gallery in a las vegas casino for more than $1 million. more helpful to brandeis, perhaps, would be a reliable stream of more modest fees. some caveats apply: brandeis should only lend to institutions capable of caring for its artworks. and it should use any revenues to guarantee a future for the rose. because the economics of maintaining a museum can be forbidding, brandeis deserves praise, not criticism, for trying to raise revenue through its collection.",['ENGLISH'],269,Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-G5T1JFOBB.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '06', 'month': '06', 'year': '2010'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",MAGAZINE,,A beginner's guide to buying an older home,"Massachusetts is stocked with vintage properties, full of charm, but also quirks. Here's some expert advice for spotting potential problems and shopping smart.",By Jon Gorey,"our electrician was working in the attic when my wife heard the unmistakable gush of a waterfall coming from the linen closet. she opened the door to find hot water cascading onto the sheets and towels — the result of a burst brass pipe, jostled just enough to be ruptured by the electrician drilling into a joist 15 feet away. we'd hired him to rewire our 1920 house, which, in addition to charming details like a built-in hutch and butler's pantry, also had a lot of original knob-and-tube wiring. and old brass water pipes, which grow brittle as they age. now we'd be hiring a plumber, too. there are things you ought to know before buying an old house — among them, the names of a few reliable tradespeople. but the crooked charms, cranky quirks, and enduring craftsmanship of an antique abode tend to be worth the accompanying headaches for a lot of homeowners, especially in history-addled new england. ""it's a way of life,"" says jay rizzo, co-owner of tiger home inspections in braintree. ""some people really enjoy it.""","body not that you always have a choice in the matter if you're house hunting in and around boston. the median massachusetts home was 53 years old in 2015 — making ours the second-oldest housing stock in the nation — and urban housing tends to be even older. four out of five homes in boston were built before 1978 and half predate world war ii; a whopping 68 percent of somerville's housing was already in place by 1939. so there's a good chance you'll end up in an old home whether you intended to or not. here's what experts say you should know before living in the past. while the late '70s may not feel like ""historic"" territory, realtor and antique homes magazine founder john petraglia says a home is like any other mechanical system, with an internal clock good for about 30 years. ""so really you're looking at the same things whether you're buying a house from 1975 or 1775,"" petraglia says. all homebuyers, first-time or otherwise, need to get professional inspections of the mechanicals — the electrical system, the roof, the plumbing, heating. ""they all have a useful life span,"" he says. but older homes sometimes have components rarely used in modern construction, such as wooden gutters or steam radiators. those are two systems that, with regular maintenance, can be perfectly fine. even a centuries-old home can be in better shape than a neglected newer one — and there's one place to find out. ""the basement is the make-or-break spot for old houses,"" petraglia says. ""because there's so many mechanicals there to look at. you can see the structural frame to see if the beams are intact or if insects have attacked them and they're ready to be renewed. look at the heating, electric, and plumbing systems and the foundation itself."" old homes have had decades or even centuries for wood-boring insects to find their way in — and infestations weren't uncommon in the days before kiln-dried lumber, rizzo says. but even extensive termite damage doesn't have to be a deal breaker. ""everything can be fixed, to a point, it just costs money,"" rizzo says, noting that any piece of timber that's more than 25 percent damaged by insects generally ought to be replaced. nor should buyers panic about sloped floors or small cracks in the foundation or main beam, says home inspector harold popp, owner of mt. vernon inspection associates in middleton. ""almost all of these old stone foundations have some cracks in them,"" popp says. ""should they be repaired, is it an emergency? most of the time, it's not,"" he says. but a home inspector may suggest hiring a structural engineer just to be sure. most people are willing to live with slightly sloping floors, says realtor john neale, the historian for the south end historical society. ""if you've got a home that's really, really out of level, you may not want to buy it unless you can spend the money to level the floors — which can be done,"" neale says. ""if a staircase is really sagging visibly, that's worth fixing,"" he adds. while there's no reason to be afraid of old houses, you should brace yourself for the unknown. old homes are full of surprises, which can lead to unexpected costs, rizzo says. ""repairs that would be regular maintenance on a newer home are going to cost more because sometimes when you open things up, you open up a can of worms. it might be a lot bigger than just replacing a pipe."" you might think you'll just swap in a new vanity to update the bathroom, for example, but find things aren't so simple. if some of the piping is brass, as in my house, ""that could break any time  .  .  .  so it might require all new plumbing,"" says popp. older piping isn't necessarily a problem. ""cast iron and copper have been around for a very long time and have served homeowners very well,"" says susan jacobs-marshalsea of s jacobs plumbing in norwood. ""there are exceptions, but on average they shouldn't be an issue"" if they're in good condition. she says, however, that galvanized, threaded pipe ought to be replaced, because it is known to rust, which can lead to blockages. even if an old home has been completely renovated with all-new pvc pipes and drains, it might still have a cast iron drain line to the street. ""that may have been underground for 80 years, and that can really be a problem,"" says popp. for instance, if an older person has been living alone for years and a family of five moves in, the added strain can be the tipping point that collapses the drain, he says. meanwhile, insuring an older home can be its own challenge: our car insurance company refused to write a policy on our home because of the knob-and-tube wiring. jim hyatt, senior vice president at arbella insurance in quincy, suggests independent insurance agents. ""they have a lot of experience, particularly in new england, with people buying older properties,"" he says. while it can cost more to insure an old house, hyatt says bundling your car and homeowners policies can save you 20 to 25 percent on the latter. updating old wiring, plumbing, and the roof usually will lead to lower premiums. old homes may not have much, if any, insulation, either, making them more expensive to heat and cool. local and state incentives can make energy upgrades more affordable. likewise, some incentives exist to address issues like lead paint (banned in 1978) and asbestos (widely used in residential construction until the late 1970s). neale says safety, energy, and major system upgrades are always a good idea, but he urges buyers to pause before overhauling a historic interior and stripping its timeless charms. ""those details are 100-, 150-plus years old, and they've survived this long. if you want to be the one to get rid of that detail for all time, think carefully before you do it,"" he says. buyers sometimes feel compelled to update everything about an old home after moving in, but the budget pressures of taking on so much at once can force them to make decisions they'll later regret. clean and modern is the current trend, neale says, but he recommends looking at how european designers integrate minimalist style with old world details like crown molding and wide window casings, because contemporary features have a shorter shelf life. ""once you remove original detail completely  .  .  .  the interior starts to age pretty quickly, meaning people can walk in and within a few years guess precisely what year you did that renovation."" preserving a home's unique features can help achieve a timeless look. neale also suggests using a preservation-minded contractor, because most remodelers find it easier and cheaper to just remove old details than to work around or restore them. ""the average contractor won't want to deal with those things, it's just a nuisance for them,"" he says. ""but when you see the outside of a beautiful old house and you walk in and it's like you've gone from the 19th century to the bridge of the starship enterprise, it's very jarring."" some big improvements, like fixing masonry issues, may go unnoticed by prospective buyers, unfortunately. ""it's not like a new bath — it's the nitty-gritty work that costs a lot to do properly,"" neale says. in other words, these are essential and expensive fixes, but they won't wow buyers like a new kitchen would. ""so if a house needs that kind of work,"" neale adds, ""make sure you're not overpaying for it, that you've priced that work into the offer you make on the property."" all of this may sound daunting, but rizzo says there's been so much turnover in the boston area that many problematic issues have already been addressed as homes have changed hands over the years. the key is whether they were done well: popp says he often comes across substandard repairs performed by previous homeowners or unlicensed contractors. bill delaney, a veteran inspector and supervisor with tiger, recommends any home buyer make a trip to city hall. ""find the folder on the house and see what repairs have been done,"" he says. ""have they pulled permits? did they get sign-off? who did the work? that's a great resource for any buyer on any house, but especially on an older home."" why bother with all this trouble? for one thing, the materials and craftsmanship found in old homes are increasingly rare commodities. original three-piece crown molding, ceiling medallions, and ornate mantels aren't exactly a growth market. ""there's so many good qualities in an older home but it really shows in the finish: beautiful trim work, the staircase,"" delaney says. ""usually you're running into true wood panels on the wall that someone hand hewed."" petraglia loves the hand-carved moldings and five fireplaces in his 1780 home, but also the historical context he gets to share. ""i know the history of the family that built this house, and it just creates a continuum for me to know who and where and what and feel like i'm a part of it,"" he says. ""i look at historic houses as homes, not as museums. they're places to live — and they're the glue in the fabric of our architectural history."" from knob-and-tube wiring and brittle brass pipes to sloping floors and uninsulated walls, we slowly remedied virtually every old home challenge mentioned in this story. it's been costly, frustrating, and exhausting at times — but also extremely rewarding. what's more, it was the house we could afford in the neighborhood we loved, and it kindly gave us shelter as we gradually addressed its many flaws — so that it might one day be defined not by its defects but by its details. and now? we wouldn't trade it for a brand-new house if we could. jon gorey is a writer in quincy. send comments to magazine@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],1792,Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-4177c4e6-a705-11e8-849d-89f31e3ee188,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '09', 'month': '09', 'year': '2018'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000926', 'className': 'INSPECTIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N926150JG', 'className': 'BUILDING & HOUSING INSPECTIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST00096UW', 'className': 'HOMEOWNERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000219', 'className': 'BUILDING & HOUSING CODES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'N531200CC', 'className': 'REAL ESTATE AGENTS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009XVW', 'className': 'WORLD WAR II'}], 'city': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'GR214', 'className': 'NORTHEAST USA'}]}"

""umass-amherst becomes the brand of the public system,"" tocco said. critics, higher education officials who would talk only off the record about their concerns, say tocco's plan could put the five campuses, which now act like miniempires, on a collision course. while some say that tocco owes his ascension to the umass board to his close political ties to romney, others contend that tocco has become well-versed in higher education policy in the seven years he has headed the state board of higher education. state officials and educators credit him for pushing through key initiatives, including improving state and community college graduation rates. the initiative initially met with resistance, but college officials say tocco was dogged and eventually swayed college leaders. state college graduation rates in the past three years have gone from 44 percent to 49 percent. ""there has been tension between tocco and the president of the institutions,"" said dana mohler-faria, president of bridgewater state college. ""but it was the sort of tension that caused the system to move forward."" robert antonucci, president of fitchburg state college, put it this way: ""steve is steve. he's upfront, he's honest. sometimes he may step on toes, but to get the system moving, you can't be a fly on the wall."" tocco says the clash over graduation rates was necessary. ""the college presidents said i was supposed to be their advocate,"" he said. ""i said, `i can't be an advocate if i don't believe in the product.' "" tocco grew up in malden and later reading, the son of a milk delivery man and stay-at-home mother. the oldest of five children, tocco was an avid athlete at reading high school and carried himself with an intense demeanor, his siblings recall. ""god love him,"" said mary cookson, his sister. ""he was never afraid to take the bull by the horns."" tocco earned a bachelor of science in pharmacy and chemistry from the massachusetts college of pharmacy in 1969, although tocco says he never intended to make a career in pharmacy. he developed an interest in public policy in 1976 when he campaigned for his childhood friend, edward j. markey, as he sought his first term in congress. tocco soon after began running markey's district office. ""steve was a natural leader,"" markey said. ""he could take any issue and work with people to try to reach consensus."" in 1980, tocco left politics to head associated builders and contractors, a trade association. eleven years later, he returned to politics as a senior aide to governor william f. weld, who, a year later, named tocco secretary of economic affairs. in 1993, weld tapped him to head the massachusetts port authority, where he stayed for four years, and clashed with then-senate president william m. bulger over how a sports and convention center would be paid for and designed. in 1997, he joined an international trade unit of the law firm mintz levin cohn ferris glovsky and popeo, and two years later, became head of the firm's lobbying arm, ml strategies, after its merger with the trade unit, the same year he was tapped to head the state board of higher education to critics, tocco's dual role, as higher education czar and head of a lobbying firm of a law firm that touts higher education as a specialty, is a collision of interests. ""a person in that position has to be able to stand up and advocate for the wishes of the university against the wishes of the governor and the legislature, and i don't know if you can do that if you are in the position that steve tocco is in as president of ml strategies,"" said james karam, the umass board of trustees chairman who was ousted by romney this month. umass trustees oversee a budget of $2.1 billion. tocco says he has sought to avoid conflicts of interest and has recused himself from board of higher education votes that awarded his law firm work as legal counsel to umass as it secured financing for construction. tocco does not register as a lobbyist because he says he runs ml strategies, but does not lobby on its clients' behalf. he said ml strategies, which has five registered lobbyists, does not represent any institutions of higher education. state records show the firm represented boston university in 2004, but tocco says it no longer does. tocco declined to provide a client list. ""he doesn't have a self-interested agenda,"" said robert o'leary of the cape and islands, who is the senate chair of the joint committee on higher education. ""he really is an advocate for the system."" tocco still lives in reading with his wife, cynthia bouthot tocco, who works for the british consulate, and has three grown children. in his spare time, he said, he plays golf in reading. but he says that time is limited: there is always background reading. tocco says he's gearing up for clashes anew if he wins control of the board.

,SPORTS; Pg. 74 p,,Neely banking on fair contract,,,"he has kept an eye on what has transpired this busy hockey offseason, but cam neely hasn't been distracted by any of it. as story upon story is written about this multimillion-dollar contract and that trade in a league that is clearly suffering growing pains, neely has gone about the business of getting some relaxing in before it's time to put on the uniform for his eighth professional season, his fifth as a boston bruin. he's not completely removed from the shifting tides in the market, however. he's in the middle of a long-term pact that pays him a base salary of $ 325,000 annually and has three years remaining, and bruins president/general manager harry sinden and neely's agent, mark perrone, are renegotiating the terms.","he has seen the money st. louis has lavished on winger brett hull and defenseman scott stevens and he has watched as sinden has tried to hammer out a renegotiation with defenseman raymond bourque. ""there's no question the market has changed from what it used to be,"" said neely, relaxing in his living room. ""when you see a team like st. louis paying that kind of money, you know there's money out there. whether there's that kind of money out there such as stevens' $ 5.1 million deal, we're not sure. a lot of us were waiting to see what was going to happen with brett hull, and it happened and i think it blew everyone away. i'm in a different situation than he was. he played out his option. i'm in the middle of a contract. guys can't really expect, unless they're in the situation that brett hull was in, to really get that kind of money, i don't think."" neely said he doesn't think that what happens with bourque has anything to do with what happens with him. ""i know what i want to get. i don't think it really matters with me what happens with ray other than the fact i want him to be happy and hopefully get what he's looking for,"" he said. ""mark and i have sat down and talked about what i think i'm worth to the club, and, basically, i'm going on that."" certainly, no one argues neely's importance to the bruins. last year he had 55 goals (the most by a bruin winger in a season) and 37 assists in 76 regular-season games while cutting his penalty minutes substantially. he added 12 goals in the playoffs and was a key reason the team went to the stanley cup finals. he played with discipline, knowing when to turn the other cheek, and his expectations for the 1990-91 bruins are high. ironically, neely said the most asked question of the summer is not about contracts but about the bruins' acquisition of tough guy chris nilan. ""everyone has asked that,"" neely said. ""i'm sure the fans will like him playing for the team. it depends on how he's going to play for us. throughout the course of the year, we did really well in not retaliating and not taking dumb penalties and our power play worked for us. i'm not saying that he's going to do that but to be aware that it worked for us. we've got to stick with, i think, the same plan."" for neely, as the saying goes, the future's so bright he's got to wear shades. people forget he's only 25, but some of the things that a superstar might be interested in - namely, money - don't really concern neely. ""people are surprised when i tell them my age. i've grown up a lot quicker than maybe some other people,"" he said. ""i think a lot of it has to do with the way i was brought up. my family, we got what we needed and nothing more, and i think that's the way i approach my situation. i never really want people to think that i have this ego."" part of his maturing process came as a result of personal tragedy. his mother died of cancer late in 1987, and neely played through the pain. that changed how he saw everything. ""with my mom passing away, it certainly changed my views on life,"" he said. ""my mom was concerned with the future, she was concerned with doing things so the family could be set for retirement, but retirement never came and i'm sure there were a lot of things my mom would've liked to have done. now i look at life like no one really knows what's going to happen tomorrow. if you have the opportunity to do something within your means, i think you should do it. ""i'm lucky,"" he added. ""i can't really complain.  i'm 25 years old and things are great.""",['ENGLISH'],715,Copyright 1990 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '08', 'day': '24', 'year': '1990'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SFT', 'className': 'SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000881', 'className': 'ICE HOCKEY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SFT', 'className': 'SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,Student dies as riot police break up protest in Egypt,,,"cairo — riot police moved into egypt's main islamic university on saturday, firing tear gas and breaking up a strike by students that threatened to disrupt midterms. one student was killed in the melee, an administration building was torched, and students fled from exam rooms.","body police say they entered eastern cairo's al-azhar campus, the site of frequent clashes in recent weeks, and deployed around other egyptian universities to prevent supporters of ousted president mohammed morsi from intimidating other students trying to take the tests. pro-morsi activists have called for an exam boycott but deny government claims that they threatened anyone. students at al-azhar, a stronghold of morsi supporters, have been protesting for weeks against his ouster and a subsequent state crackdown, which last week saw his muslim brotherhood group declared a terrorist organization. the brotherhood dismisses the label and has vowed to keep up its protests against egypt-military backed authorities. university professors and security officials accused protesting students on saturday of blocking entrances to classes and harassing students as they made their way into the campus. a statement from the interior ministry, in charge of the police, said students stormed several buildings on campus to ""terrorize students and faculty."" it said some fired shotguns into the air and smashed furniture. the ministry statement said that the attack prompted the police to move in to disperse the crowd, leading the students to setting the faculty of commerce on fire. aya fathy, a student spokeswoman, disputed the officials claim, saying the students were protesting peacefully. she said police moved in to break up protesters outside the faculty building, firing indiscriminately at them, and killing student khaled el-haddad. she accused the police of setting the building on fire to blame the students. she said the police force was chasing students on campus. footage from local tv stations and social media websites showed the campus as a battleground. flames rose from the three-story building, with rooms inside badly burned. pitched battles pitting police against rock-throwing students, some armed with what appeared to be homemade guns or projectile launchers, left the campus deserted, strewn with rocks and debris. other images showed masked protesters on roofs of university buildings lobbing rocks at security, and students jumping out of windows to escape the violence. exams were postponed at the faculty of commerce and other schools on campus. the university dean said the delay would only be for hours. osama el-abd, the dean, told egypt's state news agency that alternative classrooms would be provided for the students to take the exams, and those scheduled for sunday. he said an inquiry would begin to find students behind saturday's violence. the interior ministry did not mention el-haddad's death in its statement. but a security official confirmed he was killed and said 14 others were hurt. the official blamed the students for the violence, and said 68 students, including seven women, were arrested. three police officers were injured, he said. the official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",['ENGLISH'],670,Copyright 2013

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Official confirms review of pot law,Rosenberg seeks to 'fine-tune' act,,"a top massachusetts lawmaker monday confirmed legislators are talking about delaying aspects of the measure to legalize marijuana, a ballot initiative approved by more than 1.7 million voters last month.","senate president stanley c. rosenberg said, ""we've had discussions about delaying some of the dates to give us more time to fine-tune the bill and, in the next few weeks, we have to make final decisions on that."" rosenberg, an amherst democrat who supported legalization, told reporters if lawmakers slow the rollout, ""it's going to be a very time-limited delay."" and, he said, changes to the timing of the measure could happen in informal legislative sessions over the holiday season, which are usually attended by just a few elected officials. on thanksgiving, the globe reported lawmakers were discussing delaying several aspects of the measure, including when residents could legally grow marijuana at home and when retail stores could sell the drug. until monday, legislators were mostly mum on that globe report. the initiative, which passed 54 to 46 percent, legalizes marijuana for possession, use, and home-growing on dec. 15 — a week from thursday. it mandates the state treasurer appoint a three-person cannabis control commission to regulate the new industry by march 2017. and it authorizes retail stores to start selling the drug in january 2018. but, once the vote is certified, the legalization initiative will be a law like any other. that means the house and senate can change it through the normal legislative process. however, during informal sessions, a single legislator can thwart the proceedings. rosenberg said changes to all the dates in the measure are ""on the table."" but he said there is a ""a strong feeling that we ought to be looking at the later dates, rather than the earlier dates."" speaker robert a. deleo, a winthrop democrat who opposed legalization, echoed those comments. but his words did not make clear if he was staking out a position in favor of slowing implementation. the legislators made the comments after a closed-door meeting with governor charlie baker in which the state's tight budget appeared to be a major part of the conversation. the fiscal squeeze also came up in the discussion with the press. proponents of legalization spotlighted what they framed as the dissonance between difficult fiscal times and delaying implementation of the pot initiative. ""it's encouraging that these leaders seem to be indicating that there will be no attempt to delay the december 15 possession and home-grow provisions,"" said jim borghesani, who helped lead the effort to pass question 4. but given the state's difficult financial position, he said, ""it seems counterintuitive that they would consider pushing back the post-december 15 timelines and in doing so push back a significant new revenue stream."" the measure imposes a 3.75 percent tax on marijuana sales, in addition to the state's 6.25 percent sales tax. it also gives towns and cities the authority to add an additional 2 percent tax to local sales. joshua miller can be reached at joshua.miller@globe.com follow him on twitter @jm_bos and subscribe to his weekday e-mail update on politics at bostonglobe.com/politicalhappyhour",['ENGLISH'],557,Copyright 2016 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-7e7d3f56-bb39-11e6-92b1-1956f19eaf55,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '06', 'month': '12', 'year': '2016'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'ST000DHHS', 'className': 'MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DHI9', 'className': 'MARIJUANA REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000251', 'className': 'CANNABIS'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000458', 'className': 'DECRIMINALIZATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CY', 'className': 'REFERENDUMS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D8G7', 'className': 'DRUG LIBERALIZATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000390', 'className': 'CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE LAWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X84', 'className': 'US STATE GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DESS', 'className': 'LEGAL MARIJUANA FARMING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000160', 'className': 'BALLOTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000218', 'className': 'BUDGETS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0008XJY', 'className': 'SALES & SELLING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008XSL', 'className': 'RETAILERS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST00097CL', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000855', 'className': 'HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0009XS5', 'className': 'THANKSGIVING'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERN', 'className': 'TREASURY DEPARTMENTS'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DHHB', 'className': 'CHARLIE BAKER'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Rondo can be of assistance in rebuilding,,,"when you're at this stage of development and transition, looking for slivers of positives in excruciating losses and expecting to get pounded on a nightly basis with a patchwork roster, the encouraging signs happen off the court. such as players being vocal about their desire to stay in boston past their free agent season. jerryd bayless and kris humphries have already said they want to be part of the celtics future, and rajon rondo, as coy as he can be about his true feelings and intentions, expressed his desire to spend the rest of his career as a celtic. this is no small development. rondo must have dozens of people whispering in his ear, telling him to hold out until the summer of 2015, when he's a free agent and can score the contract of a lifetime. it's easy to summarize that things will never be the same in boston as they were during the glory days.","the return of paul pierce and kevin garnett to td garden on sunday will illustrate just how much things have changed. the band has been broken up. rondo is the last original member. it's difficult to be part of two championship eras with the same team. kobe bryant was the central figure of two separate multi-title-winning teams with the lakers, but it took mitch kupchak heisting the memphis grizzlies for pau gasol for that to occur. rondo staying in boston, potentially agreeing to a contract extension this summer or next summer, is showing great faith in president of basketball operations danny ainge to rebuild the celtics into an elite team again. friday's 101-83 loss to the oklahoma city thunder without kevin durant and russell westbrook was as far from elite as you can get. it's a sign the celtics are in a bad state, with coach brad stevens unsure what to expect each night. jeff green did his best marshawn lynch impersonation wednesday against the washington wizards with 39 points and eight 3-pointers. on friday he scored 16 points with one 3-pointer. rondo is still waiting for one of his vintage games one week into his return from major knee surgery. he finished with eight assists in 22 minutes, still trying to find himself. the celtics are fully confident that rondo will be an all-star again and that's why ainge approached the guard's representatives with an extension offer a month ago. it was turned down because rondo can earn more with a little more patience (because of the collective bargaining agreement), but the gesture was appreciated. ""me? i like to stick to the script,"" rondo said prior to friday's game. ""i don't like change much. i wouldn't mind staying here the rest of my career. things don't always seem to go that way but like i said before, it's just a business. i wouldn't mind extending another 10 years in boston."" ainge's decision to offer rondo an extension is a sign the organization realizes it needs a level of consistency through this transition. the lakers signing bryant to a two-year extension was considered foolish by some pundits, but it's an indication that bryant is an essential part of one last title run in los angeles. rondo turns 28 next month and will only improve as his lateral quickness and speed increase in the coming months, so an extension is of little risk. the celtics have to be more concerned about building around rondo — their two first-round draft picks in june, whether to bring back humphries, how to attract free agents, and whether fate will be kind enough to ainge again to land another nucleus close to the big three. rondo still has bouts of immaturity. he is still prickly and short on responses, such as after friday's game when he used just 30 words to answer the first six questions. but if the celtics were going to commit to rondo long term, now is the time to express those sentiments. the nba trade deadline is 25 days away, and more silence from the celtics would have only added to the speculation that rondo would be dealt in ainge's haste to rebuild. but ainge has always said the only way he would move rondo would be for an all-star-caliber player in return. franchise-caliber point guards are difficult to procure, and even more difficult to keep healthy, as we have learned from injuries to derrick rose, chris paul, and deron williams. but their organizations are willing to withstand the injuries given their value to the franchise. the celtics are exhibiting the same patience and dedication, and rondo showed by agreeing to his previous contract — which at $11 million per season was considered a bargain — that breaking the bank is less important than stability and faith. there is going to be some haggling about money and the negotiations may take months, but at least rondo and the celtics have mutually agreed to make attempts to remain married. and that's an important first step in the changeover to the next era. gary washburn can be reached at gwashburn@globe.com follow him on twitter @gwashburnglobe.",['ENGLISH'],958,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-63cb27b8-855e-11e3-9955-b27b6f701cf0,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '01', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SGZ', 'className': 'SPORTS BUSINESS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009R0W', 'className': 'COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX001657', 'className': 'SURGERY & TRANSPLANTATION'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST0009QXJ', 'className': 'COLLECTIVE BARGAINING'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DHHA', 'className': 'KEVIN DURANT'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'PE000C5JN', 'className': 'KEVIN GARNETT'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'PE0009TQU', 'className': 'KOBE BRYANT'}], 'city': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX606', 'className': 'MEMPHIS, TN, USA'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'GX583', 'className': 'OKLAHOMA CITY, OK, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Tipping point,"With the convergence of biotechnology companies, Kendall Square has evolved into a life sciences global hub",,"david miller of vaxess technologies treated cells with vaccines at kendall square's labcentral, which rents space to fledgling biotech companies. the three-story brick building at the corner of main and osborn streets in cambridge, on the edge of kendall square and the mit campus, captures three distinct eras in the city's innovation history. in the early 1800s, it was the site of kimball & davenport, the first builder of passenger railroad cars in america. after world war ii, it was the epicenter of the massachusetts tech boom, home to the office and private lab of edwin land, polaroid's founder. in between, thomas a. watson strung a wire from boston to cambridge, and set up the equipment to receive the first ""long distance"" phone call, in 1876. today, the building at 700 main street is home to labcentral, a nonprofit that rents space to 26 fledgling biotech companies. it is surrounded by new buildings and buildings under construction for the pharmaceutical giants pfizer and novartis. and one-year old labcentral itself hopes to expand soon, more than doubling in size to about 70,000 square feet.","body if kendall square in the 19th and 20th centuries was about manufacturing and then technology, in the 21st century it is definitively about life sciences — the business of discovering and developing new medicines. the neighborhood has reached a new inflection point in the past two years, with many more biotech companies and investors finding they can't afford not to have a presence there. meanwhile, growing tech companies are hopping — or getting pushed — across the river to boston. as a result, kendall square has transitioned from tech to biotech center. ""it's dramatically different now,"" says peter hecht, chief executive of ironwood pharmaceuticals. ""it's way past a tipping point."" if nashville is the nexus of country music, and hollywood the entertainment biz, kendall square is the global hub for transforming scientific insights into new drugs. how strong is the gravitational pull? for pfizer, having scientists based at alewife was just not close enough, so it built a new $300 million building and moved them to kendall. last week, illinois-based drug company baxter international said it would rent space in kendall for a research division that will employ about 400 people. in june, the chief executive of paris-based sanofi, which in 2011 paid $20 billion for the biotech firm genzyme, said he was relocating to cambridge. almost every new construction project underway in the neighborhood involves office or lab space for the biopharma business, which assumes that more big players will follow — and today's young start-ups will grow. what actually happens inside the r&d hive of today's kendall square? everything from early academic work into the origins of disease and the best ways to attack it, through venture capital funding, company formation, and the partnerships between small companies and large ones that provide the money to keep developing a drug, test it in humans, and eventually sell it. what doesn't happen in kendall? running those human trials, since there isn't a hospital, and manufacturing, packaging, and distributing the drugs. the building that houses wendy winckler's lab is part of the technology square complex; it once housed companies like polaroid, the supercomputer maker thinking machines, and the massachusetts institute of technology's computer science and artificial intelligence labs. (before that, there was a soap factory on the site.) now, winckler's next generation diagnostics lab at novartis uses computers and dna sequencers to better understand tumors. tumor tissue is shipped to the lab encased in paraffin wax, sliced thin, and put onto slides so technicians can separate tumor cells from normal cells. technicians then use special equipment like a nucleic acid extractor — a bit smaller than a microwave, but costing $700,000 — to remove and sequence tumor cells' dna. the objective is to better understand different types of tumors so more precise treatments for individual patients can be prescribed. ""the hope is that we'll be able to see more lasting effects with these approaches — and hopefully cures,"" winckler says. about 37 people work in winckler's lab, about half managing the data spit out of the sequencers. by late next year, the group will move into a vast new novartis campus that will stretch from massachusetts avenue to main street, effectively connecting kendall square and the university park biotech complex to the north of mit. novartis, a swiss firm, was one of the first ""big pharma"" companies to put down stakes in cambridge, in 2002. as more players come to kendall, rents for office space are creeping toward $70 per square foot, says roy hirshland of the commercial real estate firm t3 advisors. many growing tech companies are considering less expensive office space near north and south stations and in downtown crossing, hirshland says, leaving kendall to life sciences and a few bigger tech companies, like google and microsoft. so why are biotechs willing to pay? ""the networking is an intangible,"" says nick leschly, chief executive of bluebird bio, which moved into a new building near the cambridgeside galleria last year. ""i go with my laptop and sit at fuji in the afternoon, and i meet four people that i'd been meaning to see."" when i interviewed michael gilman, a serial biotech entrepreneur who works a few blocks away, he had just returned from a board meeting in the building that houses fuji, a japanese restaurant. the building was originally built for the tech company palm computing in the early 2000s, but palm never moved in. today it houses three biotechs. gilman's latest company, padlock therapeutics, hopes to develop drugs for autoimmune diseases. it has raised several million dollars in seed funding, and, if it can prove its approach, gilman is hopeful he'll attract more. an r&d executive who runs the kendall square office of pfizer, jose-carlos gutierrez-ramos, chooses a great word to describe what is happening in kendall: interdigitation — a tight weave, like when you clasp your hands together. gutierrez-ramos first began working in the neighborhood in 1996. in those days, scrappy biotech start-ups often talked like guerrilla fighters who were going to seize the riches of big pharma; now, they're often collaborators. why is that? today, academic researchers worry about the future of government funding, big pharma companies worry whether they have enough new drugs in their pipelines, and biotechs worry about the amount of money, typically hundreds of millions, required to bring a new medicine to market. ""all these constituents have moved out of their comfort zones, and they're much more open to interactions,"" gutierrez-ramos says."" it feels like we've joined teams, and we have common goals."" gutierrez-ramos works across a courtyard from the old brick building at 700 main street. in the same way that davenport & bridges once made railroad cars, or polaroid cranked out cameras, kendall today makes new medicines. and instead of helping us get around or preserve memories, the goal is to help us stay healthier and live longer. scott kirsner can be reached at kirsner@pobox.com follow him on twitter @scottkirsner and on betaboston.com.",['ENGLISH'],1240,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-3fbe6304-497a-11e4-bd50-626bec012dba,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '05', 'month': '10', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X01', 'className': 'DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008X6L', 'className': 'RELOCATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'ST0009V56', 'className': 'COUNTRY MUSIC'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'ST0009XVW', 'className': 'WORLD WAR II'}], 'industry': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'N325412MM', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001895', 'className': 'BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DF3T', 'className': 'NEW CONSTRUCTION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001323', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009S2V'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N325414MM', 'className': 'BIOLOGICS MFG'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N230000CC', 'className': 'CONSTRUCTION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X01', 'className': 'DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000CA1V', 'className': 'TRAINS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX002182', 'className': 'RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX589', 'className': 'NASHVILLE, TN, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS129', 'className': 'ILLINOIS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",G,Living Arts,Perry's `Colored Girls': `Precious' on steroids,Stars can't save director from overreaching,,"tyler perry is no stranger to kitchen-sink melodrama. but ``for colored girls'' is the kitchen sink, the washing machine, the curling iron, the sofa, and the ironing board. it's oscar, emmy, grammy, tony, and razzie. it's astounding. it's terrible. it's astounding. then terrible again. it's too much - too much screaming, too much crying, too much preaching, too much reaching, too much healing, too much feeling, and, by the time a man dangles two small black children from an apartment window, it's too much too-much. the audience i saw it with didn't seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking lipitor.","perry has written and directed eight movies in four years. ``for colored girls'' makes nine, and he goes at it like a fat person the night before a new diet. it's binge directing. most of his movies - including ``madea goes to jail'' and ``tyler perry's why did i get married too'' - are based on his own stage work. this time he's turned to the work of a more esteemed playwright. ``for colored girls'' is based on ntozake shange's ``for colored girls who have considered suicide/ when the rainbow is enuf,'' which, since its premiere in the mid-1970s, has been as common as ``our town'' on black stages. shange had written a lyrical, 20-poem bulletin - she called it a ``choreopoem'' - of black women's state of mind. seven unnamed characters - they're identified by the color of their costumes - from different american cities share a stage and a vacillating psyche. perry has dispersed her words to nine central characters whom he's situated in and around an apartment building in harlem. the women now have names and embody distinct types. monologues that shange wrote for one character are whittled down and spread among several women, then trumped up with generous helpings of perry's own ideas, which include conversational dialogue and, gasp, men. he's plucked shange out of the poetical ether and dragged her down to earth. a social worker named kelly (kerry washington) checks in on crystal (kimberly elise), whose jobless, war-veteran husband (michael ealy) beats on her and her kids. crystal endures violent tirades at home and aggravation downtown at her job, working for jo (janet jackson), an imperious magazine editor - it's ``the devil wears titanium.'' across the hall from crystal are tangie (thandie newton), a sniping sex-aholic bartender, and gilda (phylicia rashad), the nosy building manager. once a day, tangie's mother, alice (whoopi goldberg), wanders up from downstairs, robed and turbaned in white, to ask for money that could be going to her religious cult; her younger daughter, nyla (tessa thompson); or something new to shove in their cramped apartment. nyla is a dancer, who, in her first scene, ecstatically describes the recent loss of her virginity. her instructor, yasmine (anika noni rose), is wary of physical intimacy but eager to get to know the executive (kalil kain) who woos her every morning on their way to work. juanita (loretta devine) is a nurse with a second job at a community clinic. she also has a useless man residing in gilda's building. in the opening sequence, there they all are, these ``half-notes scattered without rhythm,'' trudging down the stairwell, slamming doors, shouting at each other, sucking their teeth. how did a seminal work of the stage become an extra-strength episode of ``227''? perry truly wants to speak to a moment. in doing so, the movie rests somewhere between sermon and lurid public service announcement. devine demonstrates to her patients how to use a condom. there's a trip to a back-alley abortionist (macy gray) whose rusty tools (more gasps) wouldn't be out of place in ``saw iv.'' somebody's man is on the down-low. someone else is headed for a showdown with her mother. one of these somebodies will contract a telltale cough that makes sense only in victorian england. one night jo takes her husband (omari hardwick) to box seats at the opera. while tears leak from her eyes, she misses what her husband is up to. across town, a different character is being raped. perry moves to and fro - the assault, the husband, the tears, the opera, the dinner burning on a stove - until the movie threatens to blow a gasket. shange provides the spiritual inspiration for ``for colored girls'' - so do tennessee williams and agnes nixon and gloria naylor - but perry is clearly under a competing influence. in nearly every scene, what comes to mind is lee daniels's ``precious,'' which perry executive produced. daniels's exposed-nerve filmmaking - his movie's success - might have affected perry. could he make a movie that was as raw, perceptive, emotionally vivid, and real? ha! he's made nine. ``for colored girls'' is ``precious'' on steroids, a kind of mutant issue movie. it's powerfully ridiculous and ridiculously powerful. perry's conceit is that within every ordinary woman resides this beautiful language that can lilt out of her or erupt. when she finds it, she's invincible. each actor has her moment or two, particularly the older actors - rashad, goldberg, and devine. rashad does nosy-neighbor with shocking integrity, but she infuses her speeches with august wilson and shakespeare. when devine recites the opening lines of the most famous passage - ``somebody took all my stuff'' - her voice is music. ``for colored girls'' often wants to create an earthquake that swallows us up whole. part of this is a matter of over-identification. perry has been playing a black woman for so long - he's starred as the armed-and-dangerous madea in at least five movies - that he practically is one. but black men in perry's movie are a source of visceral, physical ache. it's as if a brother has broken his heart, too. for peace and redemption, he's turned, as many a woman has, to shange. how cathartic this has been for him is unclear. his movie is caught between wallow and triumph. shange wasn't interested in victims, regardless of how special they were. but you get the sense that ``tyler perry's svu'' would suit him fine. wesley morris can be reached at wmorris@globe.com movie review for colored girls directed by and written by: tyler perry, adapted from ntozake shange's play ``for colored girls who have considered suicide/ when the rainbow is enuf'' starring: kimberly elise, janet jackson, anika noni rose, thandie newton, loretta devine, whoopi goldberg, tessa thompson, kerry washington, and phylicia rashad at: boston common, suburbs running time: 127 minutes rated: r (some disturbing violence including a rape, sexual content, and language)",['ENGLISH'],1092,Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,GPQ1M3LV8.12,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '05', 'month': '11', 'year': '2010'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Cord blood bank sued by former employee Firm denies lab chief was fired for blowing whistle on quality,,Todd Wallack Globe Staff,"the former lab director for a newton company that stores newborns' umbilical cord blood claims he was fired after blowing the whistle on problems with the company's quality controls. peter mecenas, the former laboratory director of new england cord blood bank inc., says he called federal and state regulators to complain about issues with the company's quality checks on sept. 12. the next day, mecenas says, he was fired and escorted out the door, according to a lawsuit he filed against the company on dec. 18. but john rizza, president and owner of the blood bank, says he was unaware mecenas had called regulators at the time. he said mecenas was let go after the blood bank lost its accreditation with the american association of blood banks, an industry trade group. since replacing mecenas, rizza said, the organization is on track to regaining its aabb accreditation as early as this month. the aabb declined to discuss why it pulled the blood bank's accreditation in august or to say when it might be restored.","the suit, filed in middlesex superior court, comes at a time when the business of storing babies' cord blood is gaining steam. last month, perkinelmer inc. in waltham completed a $300 million deal to buy viacell inc. of cambridge, largely for its cord blood banking business, called viacord, which generated $70 million in business last year. though it is still a niche business, a growing number of affluent families are paying thousands of dollars to store their newborn's cord blood in case the child needs it later in life. umbilical stem cells are used to help treat more than 40 diseases, including blood cancers and genetic diseases, raising hope that cord blood could one day become an alternative to bone marrow transplants or other treatments for serious diseases. perkinelmer officials estimated that 85 percent of the market is shared by three companies, perkinelmer's viacord, cryo-cell international, and cord blood registry inc. but there also are numerous smaller players scattered around the country, such as new england cord blood bank. in his lawsuit, mecenas said he called the aabb, the food and drug administration, and new york state licensing authorities in september to alert them about ongoing problems with the company's quality control system. in addition, he said he was concerned that the blood bank was continuing to claim it was accredited by the aabb, after it lost certification. in the lawsuit, mecenas said he feared he could face civil or criminal penalties because the organization wasn't in compliance with federal and state regulations. still, the suit doesn't allege that he thought any blood was contaminated or mishandled. rather, mecenas was concerned the company didn't have the quality controls needed to ensure employees always followed the proper procedures for handling the blood, his attorney said. ""it's a verification issue,"" said jo ann jorge, an attorney with gleason & gleason in ashland. rizza downplayed the safety concerns. ""there's never been a question about the actual procedures,"" rizza said. the problem was ""we didn't have enough documentation."" mecenas, who was paid $90,000 a year, is seeking lost wages, money for emotional distress, and other damages. he is also suing for damage to his reputation, saying rizza falsely blamed him for the company's loss of accreditation. in addition to suing the cord blood bank, he is also suing rizza and a related company, the new england cryogenic center inc. last year, mecenas also oversaw the lab operations at the cryogenic center, which is run by rizza's wife, catherine rizza, and also based in newton. rizza called the lawsuit ""frivolous."" and a judge has not yet ruled whether any of the allegations have merit. it is unclear whether any regulators are looking into mecenas's allegations. a spokesman for the new york department of health said the state hasn't received any written complaints about the company and will not investigate nonwritten allegations. an fda spokeswoman said she couldn't comment on whether the agency is looking into any complaints. todd wallack can be reached at twallack@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],687,Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-6379229,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '02', 'month': '01', 'year': '2008'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. 1,,Menino puts damper on Silber aims Mayor doubts BU president;,,,"mayor menino yesterday effectively quashed boston university president john silber's publicly expressed hope to succeed departing school superintendent lois harrison-jones, saying he has ""serious questions"" whether silber could do a good job. in an interview that coincided with the final day of harrison-jones' stormy four-year tenure, the mayor finally expressed his opinion on silber's open pursuit of the position. menino, while acknowledging that the system is a boat that needs to be rocked, said with a laugh that silber might well ""blow up the boat."" as silber's prospects all but vanished, sources said that milton school superintendent mary grassa o'neill, a former boston zone superintendent who is credited with making dramatic improvements in milton, has emerged as a serious contender for the job.","menino declined to confirm the reports, saying he is unaware of what candidates his search committee will recommend. but he said of grassa o'neill: ""i love her. i think she's great."" when grassa o'neill was about to leave boston for the milton job in 1993, menino recalled, he made efforts to try to get harrison-jones to keep her in boston. neither silber nor grassa o'neill could be reached for comment yesterday. as silber approaches his 69th birthday amid plans to relinquish the bu presidency, his second career has been very much in the news. first, he said he was ""intrigued"" with the notion of taking harrison-jones' job. then, a week ago, he told globe columnist david nyhan, ""there is nothing i'd rather do right now."" gov. weld, who vanquished silber in their bitter fight for the governor's office in 1990, has also become something of a booking agent for silber's next career, first seeking to recruit a reluctant silber for a high-level post overseeing the state's public education system, as the globe reported on wednesday, and also boosting his name for the boston job. in the interview, menino expressed his personal admiration for the bu president, said silber has ""good ideas,"" and noted his unwavering and early support for silber's 1990 gubernatorial candidacy. but, as he has since silber's name surfaced, the mayor at first sought to sidestep the question of silber's candidacy. asked if silber was a viable candidate, the mayor shot back: ""he hasn't applied. . . . so he's not a viable candidate. if he's interested in the job, he should apply for it. that's how this process works."" but, when pressed as to whether the autocratic silber would make a good superintendent, menino replied: ""i have some questions about that. i have some serious questions about that. i have questions about john silber's ability to deal with the diversity, to deal with a lot of the issues."" the position, menino added, ""takes a special person,"" and not just someone who will rock the boat. after suggesting silber might ""blow up"" the school system, menino asked: "". . . can he deal with the constituencies you have to deal with to run the school system? i'm very curious. i think it would be difficult for him. i think it would be very difficult."" since silber first suggested he wanted the job, the mayor's aides have privately voiced skepticism about the volatile bu president. after menino appeared to dash silber's hopes yesterday, one of the mayor's advisers said: ""the new school superintendent will not be the final and total authority on the boston school system. there is great reason to believe that john silber cannot function in that context."" grassa o'neill, who won a citywide reputation for innovation, first as a middle school principal and then as one of boston's three zone superintendents, was passed over for the superintendent's job in 1990, in part because she was not a favorite of the former elected school committee. it has since been replaced by an appointed body menino now controls. menino was acting mayor when grassa o'neill left the boston system for milton. ""i tried to get the business community to get lois to just call mary grassa o'neill and tell her, is she part of the team or not part of the team? i was trying to get lois to just give her an answer. she had the woman hanging out there for two years,"" menino said.

""they're big on employee ownership, and health benefits for everyone, even part-timers. . . . and they're the largest corporate donor to care, so it makes me feel good to be associated with them."" far more people will see kenny g perform at tomorrow's kiss concert for the fourth time; that event will raise $ 50,000 for the genesis fund and the national birth defects center. these appearances will be among his last for several months. he's trying to spend as much time as possible at his home studio, where he can see his 7-month-old son, max, while finishing a new album. this yet-untitled record will be a collection of instrumental versions of standard christmas songs - which means it has to be completed by aug. 1 to be ready for the holidays.

,NATIONAL/FOREIGN; Pg. A1,,Gore avoided money pitch in disputed temple visit,,,"when vice president al gore's motorcade arrived at the sprawling hsi lai temple complex in southern california for a luncheon last year, his staff members openly described the event as a democratic ""fund-raiser,"" featuring party officials and asian-american contributors.  gore's own words and actions at the buddhist temple, witnessed by a globe reporter and described here for the first time, give credence to the vice president's assertion that while he knew there was a fund-raising component to the event, he viewed it more as a good-will visit with asian-american leaders.  although other party leaders warmed up the audience with political rhetoric, gore's remarks were non-partisan and restrained, markedly different from the biting one-liners he offered at another fund-raiser that evening in northern california.  at the hsi lai temple, gore spoke in personal terms of his acquaintance with hsing yun, the venerable master and leader of the temple and its growing worldwide congregation, and of the us tradition of tolerance for immigrant cultures. gore made no explicit pitch for contributions.","the hsi lai temple lunch will be featured when the senate campaign finance hearings resume today, with three nuns from the temple expected to testify that they served as conduits for tens of thousands of dollars of potentially illegal contributions from the church.  to defuse the controversy, gore's aides have mounted an aggressive defense of their boss - briefing reporters and releasing internal documents about the fund-raiser. after declining several requests during the past 15 months, gore's office agreed this week to release the globe from an off-the-record agreement that allowed this reporter to attend the fund-raiser, but that prohibited publication of details from the gathering. when the democratic fund-raising scandal broke last fall, gore said he thought the lunch had been a ""community outreach"" event. after the globe and other news organizations published the contents of memos from the vice president and his top aides that described the luncheon as a fund-raiser, gore acknowledged that he knew it was a ""finance-related"" event with traditional democratic donors invited.  but gore maintains that his staff did not tell him that the temple visit, which originally was scheduled as a non-political visit, had been transformed by mid-level party officials into a fund-raiser when plans for another southern california fund-raiser fell through. gore also says he did not know that temple members allegedly were pressured by those democratic officials to give tens of thousands of dollars in questionable contributions to the party after the luncheon and were then reimbursed by the taiwanese buddhist church.  the reporter accompanied gore on the marathon trip from washington to california on april 29, 1996, and interviewed the vice president on air force ii for a presidential campaign feature. the trip was packed with a variety of events, most prominently a midmorning speech to cable television executives in los angeles and a late-afternoon stroll with police on the beat in san jose. press secretary peggy wilhide and other members of gore's staff and security detail openly described two events on the day's schedule as ""fund-raisers"" closed to the press: the buddhist temple event in the los angeles suburb of hacienda heights and an evening reception in a private home in los altos hills, near san jose. upon request, gore's staff agreed to allow the globe into each occasion on an off-the-record basis.  after snarling traffic on the southern california freeways, gore's motorcade pulled up to the huge hsi lai complex shortly before 1 p.m. and was greeted by a high school marching band playing sousa tunes.  although the phrase ""buddhist temple"" might bring to mind a simple pagoda, the 15-acre hsi lai compound cost $ 30 million and includes a number of shrines and meditation halls, classrooms and conference rooms, a nunnery, a vip lodge, an auditorium, a museum, a large central courtyard, and two theme gardens with statues of arhats and bodhisattvas - buddhist holy beings.  the complex is the largest buddhist monastery in the western hemisphere. yun has built an international congregation of a million followers from his base in taiwan. gore first visited yun in taiwan in 1989 and then hosted the buddhist leader at the white house in march 1996.  gore's staff was warned to use ""great, great caution"" and to beware of a ""hidden"" taiwanese agenda in yun's dealings with gore, according to an april 19, 1996, memo from robert suettinger, a national security council official. yet the correspondence among the white house staff shows that gore's advisers and democratic finance officials repeatedly characterized the lunch as a prime fund-raising opportunity.  congressional investigators believe that two democratic party operatives, john huang and maria hsia, pushed to bring gore and the prosperous taiwanese buddhists together, arranged the luncheon, presided at the fund-raiser, and returned to the temple in the following days to press for contributions from nuns and monks who were later reimbursed by the church.  under state and federal law, non-profit institutions may not host partisan political events and retain their tax-favored status. individuals are prohibited from making political contributions in their own names only to be reimbursed by another individual or organization.  through statements issued by their attorneys, hsia and huang have denied any wrongdoing. in a statement to senate investigators released last month, yun accepted responsibility for the contributions from members of his temple but said his organization was only trying to honor gore and express its gratitude to the united states. he said the mistakes occurred because of a misunderstanding of us campaign laws. a prime question at the senate hearings will be what gore knew. gore says he knew the lunch guests were members of the democratic party's ""asian pacific american leadership council."" his briefing book that day noted membership in the group ""requires an annual contribution of $ 2,500 per person or $ 5,000 per couple."" his ""role"" at the luncheon was to ""extend appreciation for participant support and inspire political and fund-raising efforts among the asian pacific american community."" although representative robert matsui, a democrat from california, and don fowler, chairman of the democratic national committee, took turns thanking the audience for supporting the administration, gore chose not to use the partisan ""talking points"" from his speechwriters criticizing republican bob dole and house speaker newt gingrich. instead, gore and yun spoke of tolerance and religion. the vice president nibbled at his vegetarian meal, exchanged gifts with yun, posed for photographs with the 70 monks clad in saffron robes, and stood for a moment of reflection before a giant statue of sakyamuni buddha.",['ENGLISH'],1165,Copyright 1997 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '09', 'day': '04', 'year': '1997'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000245', 'className': 'CAMPAIGN FINANCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000769', 'className': 'FUNDRAISING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000118', 'className': 'ASIAN AMERICANS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D9TK', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTY DONATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00099LO', 'className': 'BUDDHISTS & BUDDHISM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DBE6', 'className': 'POLITICAL DONATIONS & FUNDRAISING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CM', 'className': 'AIR FORCES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000CTIZ', 'className': 'SCANDALS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CM', 'className': 'AIR FORCES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TN2', 'className': 'AL GORE'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

""worried husband"" asked if it was ok to have a ""secret friendship"" with another woman. friendships help us get through life. one problem with our understanding of marriage is that it should be the ""be-all and end-all"" relationship. that is simply impossible. it's this wrong-headed belief that drives us to feel as if we must have ""secret"" relationships. if we can learn to develop honest relationships with our spouses (and our friends), we avoid the destructive baggage that comes with keeping secrets. your spouse doesn't need to know every single thing that you do or say or feel, but she/he does have the right to not be lied to. secrets, in the sense of this situation, are lies. sally a. i agree. thank you. send questions via e-mail to askamy@tribune.com or by mail to ask amy, chicago tribune, tt500, 435 n. michigan ave., chicago, il 60611.",['ENGLISH'],576,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-b1c46da0-669a-11e2-a41c-48b12b8dd7a4,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '04', 'month': '02', 'year': '2013'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDY2MUQ5Rjc5MkIzNEI2MUIxREQ1ODkwMTVBQzdEOUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU', 'className': 'Marriage'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N624190UM', 'className': 'COUPLE COUNSELING'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N812199GM', 'className': 'DATING SERVICES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",EDITORIAL OPINION,Opinion,Reality TV is a first step toward reality,,,"no, we haven't stopped talking about bruce jenner. in the week since the star athlete announced that he is transitioning to female, magazines have been filled with details and reactions — and reports about an upcoming reality series about jenner's new life. more television? of course. the cynical take on jenner's big reveal was always the tv-ness of it all: a star of the ultimate guilty-pleasure show just got the ultimate promotional roll-out. last week's abc special on jenner drew a stunning 16 million viewers, many of whom might tune in for the next adventure.","body let's set aside the absurdity, first: there are far less wrenching ways to get attention. jenner is bravely using his fame to help other people in his position. so let's applaud him for this next step. reality tv, maligned as it is, might be the best possible vehicle for opening minds. when it comes to social change, pop culture tends to lead the nation, and tv is best-placed to do the leading. recurring characters, in the intimacy of your living room, force the kind of familiarity that breeds acceptance. just look at ""ellen"" or ""will and grace."" and while a lot of attention has gone to the transgender characters in new, edgy premium fare — netflix's ""orange is the new black"" and amazon prime's ""transparent"" — mainstream television has offered positive portrayals for even longer. in the past seven years, we've seen a sexy transgender woman play a sexy transgender woman on abc's primetime hit ""dirty sexy money."" we've seen transgender contestants on ""america's next top model"" and ""dancing with the stars."" now comes reality tv. this summer, jenner's show will join a docuseries on abc family, produced by ryan seacrest, about a teenaged boy whose father is becoming a woman. tyra banks is producing a reality series for vh1, called ""transamerica."" and last month, discovery life premiered ""new girls on the block,"" about a group of transgender women in kansas city. yes, there's a danger that transgenderism will be treated like a novelty, something to gawk at. reality tv is, to some extent, our modern sideshow, with the mid-to-outer cable orbits filled with subcultures on display. as with any genre, quality varies. but even tlc, home to the detested ""honey boo boo,"" has aired plenty of shows that lead to broader understanding: ""little people, big world,"" about a couple with dwarfism; the brief series ""all-american muslim,"" whose chief contribution was to prove that most arab-americans are as boring as the rest of us. if some people tune in to stare, they still come out at least a little bit enlightened. this is true even of shows that aren't so obviously didactic. in the kindest light, you could see ""keeping up with the kardashians"" as a portrait of a blended family — and now, a model for how family can outlast marriage, and love can transcend change. this is also the underlying theme of ""new girls on the block,"" which is wonderful. not perfect, but wonderful. yes, the show dwells a little too sensationally on before-and-after photos, and is filled with manufactured scenarios: ""we're going on a blind double date!"" but the show is also filled with models of positivity: a mother who has become her daughter's fiercest advocate; a best friend who became a boyfriend, post-transition. the most poignant storyline involves one woman's longtime wife, who is struggling with her own plans for the future. this isn't the marriage she imagined — but she so deeply loves the person she wed that she feels compelled to stay, and give support. these are true, complex emotions. and the fact that they're conveyed through something partly artificial — real people, play-acting at times — isn't exactly a fault. in some ways, it's a necessary feature. to change minds, you need to attract eyeballs, whether by exploiting celebrity, conflict, or both. a show about someone living happily, accepted seamlessly into family and society, wouldn't be particularly interesting to watch. for most transgender people, that kind of unremarkable life is the ultimate goal. bruce jenner's fame will help us get there faster — and so will the reality cameras. ironic, but true. joanna weiss can be reached at weiss@globe.com follow her on twitter @joannaweiss.",['ENGLISH'],720,Copyright 2015 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-e0aff8c4-ef59-11e4-b3fa-949dfa089063,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '02', 'month': '05', 'year': '2015'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D0JG', 'className': 'TRANSGENDER PERSONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX001188', 'className': 'MUSLIM AMERICANS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000109', 'className': 'ARAB AMERICANS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001704', 'className': 'TELEVISION PROGRAMMING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009QWH', 'className': 'REALITY TELEVISION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N515120CC', 'className': 'TELEVISION INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DHQF', 'className': 'CAITLYN (BRUCE) JENNER'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE0009UYO', 'className': 'RYAN SEACREST'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'PE0009UJU', 'className': 'TYRA BANKS'}], 'state': [{'score': '52', 'classCode': 'GS141', 'className': 'MISSOURI, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",METRO,,"The fats domino That trans gunk is bad, but so is overpolicing",,Sam Allis,"the observer the subject, good readers, begins with trans fat, the lethal goo found among many of the ingestibles i hold dear. entire forests have been destroyed to print articles on its evils. trans fats are indeed killers. there is no earthly reason to keep putting them in food, but the observer is less interested in the molecular particulars of the hydrogenation process producing the sludge than the movement to ban it. my favorite anti-trans-fat shock trooper is one stephen joseph, who runs bantransfats.com on a shoestring out of his place in the bay area. he's a lawyer - a former litigator and washington lobbyist no less - who decided to wage his own private war against the artery-clogging gunk. in 2003, the man pushed kraft to reduce or eliminate trans fats in oreos and a bunch of other delectables.","joseph, a 52-year-old brit, is one of those classic characters in these dramas - obsessive, relentless, unbalanced. ""i live it and sleep it and dream it,"" he says about his fight. joseph professes shock and amazement at the reactions to his efforts. ""when i did the oreo case in 2003, i was flooded with hate mail,"" he says. ""there are some lunatics out there. but they're wrong. i know i'm right."" so much for common ground.  ""this libertarian streak in the us - it's an anarchistic streak. it's absurd,"" he adds, his voice rising. ""everything said in this day and age has to be put in emotional terms."" welcome aboard, steve. you euros are all in it together. over here, we say, get the hell off my land. the trans fat war has roused a latent libertarian streak in the observer, a big government stalwart. i've always consigned libertarians to radio talk shows and the cato institute, and cite with glee to government detractors the horrid big brotherism of rural electrification, low-income heating fuel assistance, and social security. and yet even i'm getting agita over this extension of government into our lives. proponents of the ban yawn at the inevitable ""what's next?"" refrain from the likes of me, but it really is worth asking what is next? today, trans fats; tomorrow, microwaves. consider this: the bangor city council passed an ordinance in january making it an offense for an adult to smoke in a car if there is a person under 18 also in it. no one should smoke with a child in the car, but this is absurd. imagine a mother frantically spraying glade in her suv as the uniform raps on the window. in february, governor rick perry of texas, the state separated at birth from the live free or die bizarros in new hampshire, issued an executive order making vaccinations against a sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer compulsory for all sixth-grade girls. merck, which makes the vaccine, rolled over with joy like a porpoise. last week, the legislature killed it. also last week, the boston city council proposed a ban in boston on plastic shopping bags. joseph, for one, thinks that is beyond the pale. where does all this end? is there a line in the sand anymore that says, here and no further? everyone means well when they propose these compulsory schemes in the name of health and the environment, but then so do book burners. trans fats, unlike books, contribute big-time to heart disease. but don't legislate them. don't create cadres of food police and vehicular smoking police. i'm troubled by the legislation filed by state representative peter koutoujian, co-chairman of the joint committee on public health to outlaw the use of trans fats in the preparation of food in every restaurant in the state. he blithely leaves enforcement to local health officials, who apparently don't have enough to do following crippling cuts in local aid over the years. ""it's really up to the department of public health,"" he says about enforcement. grand. we learned last month in a report by state auditor joe denucci that the local food inspectors across the state are woefully understaffed. denucci further questioned the ability of the state department of public health to ride herd effectively on them. all this is now in the lap of john auerbach, the new state health czar. he is, thank god, less gung ho about legislating trans fats out of our lives than educating us to dump them. labeling food, for starters, is huge. ""it's better to do it by reading cards on walls than our forcing you to do it,"" he says. auerbach visited new york city to see how it is enforcing its restaurant trans fat ban. he learned from city authorities there that the overwhelming majority of restaurants use small amounts of trans fat or none at all. so inspectors focus on the small group of monster trans fat mainliners like dunkin' donuts. the broader issue, of course, is who decides how we live. as we learn more about the profusion of scary things in our midst, the debates when government intervention makes sense and when it's dumb will only multiply like guppies. this is, after all, the american way. but it's also because government at every level has lost its presumption of innocence.  sam allis can be reached at allis@globe.com.",['ENGLISH'],843,Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5869607,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '29', 'month': '04', 'year': '2007'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1MzRDRUY1OTZBNDRDNTlDODQzRDRCMUFCNDc2RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q', 'className': 'Ordinances & Regulations'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001042', 'className': 'LOBBYING'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Local Governments'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'STX001512', 'className': 'RURAL DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX000669', 'className': 'EXECUTIVE ORDERS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000A4KY', 'className': 'LOW INCOME PERSONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'N624229GM', 'className': 'ENERGY ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001557', 'className': 'SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE'}], 'industry': [{'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST0008X0O', 'className': 'SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}], 'person': [{'score': '50', 'classCode': 'PE0009UP3', 'className': 'RICK PERRY'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS145', 'className': 'NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Confused by foreclosure-prevention program? A new website offers guidance,,Michelle Singletary,"the color of money the treasury department and department of housing and urban development have launched a website that provides information for troubled homeowners about the obama administration's ""making home affordable"" program. www.makinghome affordable.gov, arranges in one place information on the two-pronged approach of the initiative.","there's the refinancing part, designed to help homeowners who are paying their mortgages on time but are not able to refinance at current low rates because of a decrease in their home's value. eligible first mortgages can't exceed 105 percent of the home's current market value. there's no help to renegotiate a second home loan. the second prong is aimed at homeowners struggling because their interest rates have increased or they've had a reduction in their incomes. this part aims to modify terms to get homeowners to a point where their monthly first-mortgage payment is not more than 31 percent of their pretax monthly income. one of the good things about this site is the page containing frequently asked questions. read them carefully because this is where you'll find program details. for example, under the modification program, you have to show you can make your payments for three months. if you stay current at the end of the trial period, the interest rate you receive will stay fixed for five years. the government is providing incentives for loan servicers to offer interest rates as low as 2 percent so that a borrower's monthly payment hits that 31 percent mark. the treasury says if a 2 percent interest rate does not result in a payment that is affordable, your servicer could extend your loan to 40 years or defer repayment on a portion of the amount you owe, or a portion of your mortgage debt could be forgiven. but the latter option is completely up to the servicer. also, starting in the sixth year the interest rate may increase no more than 1 percentage point per year until it reaches the rate cap indicated in your modification agreement. this cap can never be higher than the market rate on the day your loan was modified. depending on which program fits your needs, you can take a quick test to see if you qualify for help. if your answers show you're eligible, you're taken to a page with a checklist of the documents you will need when contacting your loan servicer. if you are scheduled for a foreclosure, be proactive. just because you appear to qualify doesn't mean you will get an automatic stay on your foreclosure. contact your servicer. you should also call a hud-approved counselor at 888-995-4673. if you are having trouble paying your mortgage or you're facing foreclosure, check out the site. if you're having trouble refinancing, go there to get information. but don't expect too much. you'll have calls to make and a lot of paperwork to complete before you get help. michelle singletary is a columnist for the washington post. she can be reached at singletarym@washpost.com",['ENGLISH'],492,Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-7186375,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '22', 'month': '03', 'year': '2009'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Banking Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"

""there is overarching globalization and consolidation,"" he said, ""and i expect to see this continue."" the boston stock exchange, the nation's third-oldest, was founded in 1834 by 13 businessmen. today, about 65 companies own the exchange's more than 200 seats. at the high point in 2001, 100 million shares a day exchanged hands through the boston stock exchange. in recent years, the exchange largely provided an alternative to the new york stock exchange for the area's mutual fund companies. fidelity investments and three wall street brokerage houses invested $20 million to help develop the unsuccessful electronic platform. on average, its electronic trading system handled about 5 million to 10 million shares a day. curran said innovation was long the hallmark of the exchange, from its early investments in western railroads in the 19th century, to adopting new technology that allowed remote trading. the deal with nasdaq was ""difficult because of the heritage,"" curran said, ""but the exchange has always had to adapt."" nasdaq, the new york company best known for the technology firms that trade on its exchange, recently has acquired all or part of stock markets in dubai, sweden, and the united kingdom. nasdaq will shut down the boston stock exchange at 100 franklin st. in the financial district and consolidate operations in new york. about 20 employees will lose their jobs. nasdaq also is acquiring the boston exchange's regulatory arm, which oversees the boston options exchange and employs about 25. that will remain in boston, exchange officials said. the options exchange, opened in 2004, was not included in the deal with nasdaq. the boston stock exchange is currently in talks to sell its 21 percent options exchange stake to montreal exchange inc., which would boost its holdings in the options exchange to 53 percent. nasdaq's deal is expected to close in early 2008, subject to approval by the securities and exchange commission. in addition to another trading venue, nasdaq gains a clearing license, which will allow it to settle trades made on its exchange. clearing is the process that allows buyers and sellers to actually exchange money and shares, and nasdaq now pays a third party about $14 million a year to clear its transactions. the acquisition of another boston stock exchange license will allow nasdaq, which lists stocks with four- and five-letter symbols, to offer companies shorter ones. that could make it easier for nasdaq to lure companies listed on the rival new york stock exchange, where symbols are one to three letters. these firms could list on nasdaq without changing their symbols, analysts said.

""these are societal assets that you don't want to lose,"" says kochan. in family feuds, logic and reason can go out the window. demoulas family kmembers are stubbornly sticking to their positions instead of using clear-headed business judgment. it's time to put that aside and bring in a third party to say to the company leadership: let's get this kresolved.",['ENGLISH'],585,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-7e416130-1ce3-11e4-8733-4faa7274b16b,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '07', 'month': '08', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'STX001421', 'className': 'PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000D43B', 'className': 'BUSINESS CLOSINGS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009QD4', 'className': 'NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00097LT', 'className': 'LABOR FORCE'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000A1SO', 'className': 'BUSINESS EDUCATION'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009WVP', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT FAIRS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N445110MM', 'className': 'GROCERY STORES & SUPERMARKETS'}], 'person': [{'score': '68', 'classCode': 'PE0009U67', 'className': 'DEVAL PATRICK'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,McCourty analyzes point of contention,,,"foxborough — by scoring 38 points at tennessee, then 44 in sunday's win over the texans, the miami dolphins were the highest-scoring team in the nfl in back-to-back weeks. the last time that happened: never. the 82-point outburst has been supplemented by a pair of defensive touchdowns, but ryan tannehill has had a lot to do with it. over the last two games, the fourth-year quarterback from texas a&m has been almost perfect: 40-for-48 passing, 548 yards, and 6 touchdowns. he completed 25 consecutive passes and had four touchdown passes against the texans in his first nine pass attempts.","now tannehill and a confident dolphins offense bring their show to gillette stadium, where the patriots defense will be waiting for a thursday night game. thanks to a bye week and a coaching change — dan campbell has taken over for joe philbin —miami has seemingly reinvented itself. ""they're doing a good job of just getting the ball in the playmakers' hands. they're still doing some of the things they were doing, they're just doing them a lot better,"" safety devin mccourty said. ""you turn on the film of last week, guys are catching 6-, 7-yard passes and just turning them into 50-, 85-yard gains. they have a lot of explosive players. everyone that gets the ball has a chance to go the distance, from the starting two or three receivers to the guys that come behind them. you've just got to be ready for every skill position."" that starts with tannehill, who has led the dolphins to a two-game season split with the patriots in each of the past two seasons. in six starts against new england, tannehill has eight touchdown passes and has been sacked 25 times. last week, he had long touchdown passes to three teammates: lamar miller (54 yards), rishard matthews (53), and jarvis landry (50). ""he's doing a good job taking care of the football, and he knows exactly what he wants to do on the field right now. he sees the defense, he's taking what's there, and he's just playing good football,"" mccourty said. ""any time you have 25 straight completions that means you're not throwing interceptions, and even better, you're not throwing incomplete passes. he's just doing a good job of knowing what's out there, and taking advantage of it."" waves of dolphins the dolphins (3-3) have outscored their past two opponents by a combined score of 82-36, obviously showing signs of a big-play offense. but according to patriots quarterback tom brady, the miami defense has played just as big a part in the dolphins' transformation. ""they're playing great. every time we play these guys, they've been a challenge,"" brady said. ""they're riding high right now. i think they're really getting after the quarterback, and they've got some real good guys in coverage. but [cameron] wake and [olivier] vernon and [ndamukong] suh and [earl] mitchell and [derrick] shelby, they've got a whole group of pass rushers that, the last couple games, have been performing really well."" suh and co. have combined for only 11 sacks on the season, tied for the fourth-lowest total. the dolphins' defense ranks 21st in total defense, including 30th against the run. but in their victories over tennessee and houston, the dolphins forced five turnovers, returning a pair of interceptions for touchdowns. ""and offensively, they've just been scoring a lot of points. they get ahead and they kind of unleash the pass rushers on you, cameron wake strip-sacks a quarterback, and the next thing you know the game's blown open there,"" said brady, who has an 8-0 record in thursday night games. ""it was blown open in the second quarter against houston, it was blown open in the third quarter against tennessee, so we've got to make sure we stay on track and execute well so that we keep things under control. you can't be one-dimensional against these guys."" collins checks in linebacker jamie collins, who played all 72 defensive snaps against the jets on sunday, was asked if the short turnaround would be a tough hurdle to overcome.

(eds note: stocks in the s&p 500 are trading at an average of about 14 times earnings over the past 12 months, below the 10-year average of about 15). so stocks are a bit cheap, and you can expect a reasonable return over the next decade   maybe 6, 7, 8, or 9 percent a year, something in line with the historic average. corporate earnings are the key factor to look at. lots of people make the mistake of thinking stock returns are tied to economic strength. but the data don't corroborate that. and the interesting thing about corporate profits is that they are blind to national boundaries. what about the outlook for bonds? the best predictor is the current yield to maturity. the yield now on a 10-year treasury bond is a little under 2 percent. so you might expect 2 to 3 percent a year from a bond portfolio. that's if you include some higher-yielding bonds where's there's greater credit risk than in the treasury market. two to 3 percent is certainly less than we have experienced historically from bonds, and it's significantly less than what we've seen over the last 30 years of a bull market for bonds. investors have added more than $1 trillion in cash to bond funds since the 2008 financial crisis. what's the risk for investors who have moved much of their portfolio into bonds? i'm worried. in some cases, these investors have been seeking yield, and in other cases they've been pursuing an investment they consider to be much safer than the stock market. unfortunately, we may be seeing the bond market's version of 1999 and the run-up of tech stocks in the stock market. we're building a pretty big bubble in the bond market and bubbles just don't end pleasantly. a lot of investors could be disappointed. when the economy does start to strengthen, interest rates will go back up and bond returns will be disappointing, even negative. we're on the precipice of possibly going over the fiscal cliff, with no deal reached yet between the white house and congress to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts. will actions in washington continue to heavily influence the market? the government has played a bigger role in the economy ever since the unfolding of the financial crisis. certainly, the bond market has been influenced by the federal reserve's moves to keep rates very low. but in the stock market, i don't think the government has played as great a role. i cite this year as a perfect example. we've all been concerned about going over the fiscal cliff for a year now, and it certainly has intensified in the last three to six months. yet the market continues to rally, and it's up 15 percent this year. investors should think long-term and not get caught up with what is going on in the economy, or what the government is up to. do you have any regrets from your 25 years at vanguard? i regret not moving into etfs stronger and earlier. but there are a lot of misconceptions people have about etfs. when they were introduced in the 1990s, they were portrayed as a new investment. in fact, they're just a new way to distribute an old investment, the index mutual fund. early on, the bulk of etfs were essentially index funds, and instead of dealing with the index fund provider, you merely bought it on a financial exchange. what mistakes have you made with your own investment portfolio? being too conservative when i first started investing as a young man. at that age, you have a long time horizon and should probably be more aggressive. i think that's a mistake a lot of young investors are making today. the data show that twentysomethings are much more conservative than twentysomethings were 10 years ago. that will make it difficult for them to reach their retirement goals.",['ENGLISH'],1034,Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-337d3f04-4bc3-11e2-9c46-42dacef8dfd6,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '23', 'month': '12', 'year': '2012'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Labor & Employment Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Securities Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX000340', 'className': 'COMPANY EARNINGS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000629', 'className': 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009SPQ', 'className': 'COMPANY LISTS & RANKINGS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000A1SO', 'className': 'BUSINESS EDUCATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'N525910GG', 'className': 'MUTUAL FUNDS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DDVY', 'className': 'FINANCIAL ANALYST RECOMMENDATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N525910MM', 'className': 'EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N525910MG', 'className': 'INDEX FUNDS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI', 'className': 'Stock Exchanges'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N523110GM', 'className': 'SECURITIES TRADING'}], 'state': [{'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GS154', 'className': 'PENNSYLVANIA, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,Young marriage is on the rocks,,,"q. i have been married to my husband for less than a year. sadly, i feel he has misrepresented himself and this marriage is not at all what i had envisioned or signed up for. we are both older, career-oriented, and this is a first marriage for both of us. shortly after we tied the knot and the ""shininess"" wore off he began to be unhappy and can't seem to handle day-to-day obstacles and life together in general. this is odd to me as we lived together before we were married. after marriage he began making hurtful comments threatening divorce (now on a weekly basis). recently he said that our marriage was a mistake. however, the next day he was fine, and i'm supposed to forget what was said the day before — until he finds something else that's wrong to complain about.","he will remain cold for days on end and nag me until i'm exhausted mentally. when he is angry he says he is not sure he loves me or ""is really in love with me."" i ask him to apologize — and he laughs in my face. if he breaks me down with talk of divorce i will call him on it and ask him to see a lawyer. he has yet to meet with a lawyer; he only threatens, like some sick game. can you help explain what is going on? is the marriage doomed in your eyes? i'm growing resentful. sad a. you're growing resentful? i'd say resentful has already left the station. next stop: rage. don't wait for him to wear you down and then act on his own behalf. give him a choice: marriage counseling or a lawyer. regardless of what he chooses, you should see a counselor and a lawyer. your passivity makes you very vulnerable. q. i love my sister dearly. she is very close to her kids. her daughter, ""betsy,"" is in her 40s. she is my goddaughter. betsy and her half-sister, ""carole,"" have been estranged since betsy published a book that included some derogatory things about carole. neither woman has had any role in my daughter's life, but my sister has. i owe my sister big time for many things (not monetary). i verbally invited my goddaughter betsy to my daughter's upcoming graduation party. i received an e-mail that she would love to attend unless i invited carole. i do not want any part of their feud. i invited my sister, who told me she would attend, until i told her that i didn't want to be involved in her daughters' fight so i was not inviting either of them. she hung up on me. am i out of line here? betsy and i have had problems before. the last time i invited her somewhere, she was upset with me and said, ""i'd rather stick a fork in my eye than come to your house."" what should i do? no right answer a. i agree that you should not involve yourself in this feud — but then you did involve yourself when you invited one sister and not the other and then uninvited the one you did invite (not that i blame you). one way to avoid feud involvement is to invite all family members to family events. if people want to exclude themselves based on who else is coming, then more power to them. another way is to exclude people who are rude, crude drama queens. so far, these three will be staying away from your party, which means you might actually have a good time. pat yourself on the back. you win. amy dickinson can be reached at askamy@tribune.com follow her on twitter @askingamy or ""like"" her on facebook.",['ENGLISH'],574,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,2dc2ef46-e23a-11e3-b8c4-abbf56120d4b,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '28', 'month': '05', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001085', 'className': 'MARRIAGE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N624190UM', 'className': 'COUPLE COUNSELING'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. B2,,Harshbarger lands faculty post at Northeastern,,,"harshbarger, who lost his bid for governor last fall, has accepted a joint position as a visiting professor at the school's college of criminal justice and its law school.  the 18-month appointment, which harshbarger will begin jan. 21, carries the rank of full professor and pays in the range of $90,000 to the ""low $100s,"" according to northeastern university president richard m. freeland.","  outgoing attorney general scott harshbarger will join the faculty of northeastern university when he leaves office this month. besides teaching a full load of courses - beginning in the spring semester with undergraduates and the summer with law students - harshbarger will also work with the university's center for criminal justice policy research and its tobacco products liability project.  ""he will be a valuable voice on public policy issues,"" said freeland, who said he offered harshbarger the post early in their ""evolving"" discussions about his future. harshbarger was one of the first attorneys general to sue the tobacco industry to recover health-care costs for treating smoking-related illnesses. under a recent settlement, massachusetts will receive $7.6 billion over the next 25 years as well as $325 million annually from tobacco manufacturers.  ""the jury is still out on how those dollars should be used,"" said freeland. as harshbarger works with the school's tobacco liability project, ""i'm sure he'll be very active in trying to shape policy recommendations in that area."" harshbarger has made no secret of his desire to be teaching where he could also focus on criminal justice policy. in a statement released by northeastern, he said the college of criminal justice ""has been on the cutting edge of such issues as community policing and youth violence prevention,"" and that its law school and tobacco project ""were in the trenches against big tobacco when it was still a lonely battle.""  freeland said the 18-month appointment fits nicely with harshbarger's plans, which, it has been suggested, might include another run for public office.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",EDITORIAL OPINION,Opinion,Don't back into a bad decision on Northern Ave. Bridge,,,"if $9.4 million in federal funding leads to the permanent demolition of the northern avenue bridge, it'll be a textbook study in how the government can back into decisions that future residents regret. the globe's shirley leung reported this week that us representative stephen lynch secured some federal money to help design a replacement for the historic swing bridge connecting downtown boston with the seaport district. lynch wants to remove the now-shuttered metal structure and start afresh. noting that he recently had lunch with federal judges who worried about the effect of gridlock upon public safety, he also told leung the new bridge should be open to cars. when all the stars align correctly, both here and in washington, great things can happen for boston; burying the traffic-choked central artery famously required the exertions of former house speaker tip o'neill. but it's also possible for bureaucratic prerogatives to align the wrong way — for iffy ideas to become reality without proper vetting.","lynch and the judges presume that adding a vehicular connection will reduce traffic in the area. there is no evidence for this belief. peter furth, a professor of civil engineering at northeastern, notes that the configuration of roadways around northern avenue limits its ability to alleviate traffic congestion in and out of the seaport district. the bridge ""has very little capacity for doing that,"" he said. the only major recent study of transportation in the area — overseen by the group a better city and released a year ago — didn't examine the possibility of general vehicular traffic on the bridge in any detail. ""there was no home-run traffic benefit to the bridge,"" abc president richard dimino told me. the discussion of vehicular use centered on accommodating emergency situations and, perhaps, transit buses. the overall study, he notes, focuses heavily on transit. (i asked lynch's office for any studies supporting his position but didn't hear back by deadline.) preservationists don't dispute that parts of the current bridge are in bad shape. quite the contrary; the city's inaction over the course of decades galls them, because it amounts to demolition by neglect. what worries them is that, under the auspices of protecting public safety, the city will demolish so much of the bridge that restoration becomes impossible — and a new vehicular bridge becomes an inevitability. mayor marty walsh's office says the plan is to remove all three spans of the bridge and some of the subsurface infrastructure. the historic truss system and the stone blocks surrounding the bridge's piers will be preserved ""for future reuse."" yet the easy way out for the city is to deem the old bridge hopeless. whatever the city does will also have to pass muster with the coast guard and the army corps of engineers, which have a say over structures in navigable waterways such as fort point channel and clearly want to see some resolution. nobody wants to pick fights with federal judges, not even on matters of transportation logistics or urban design. or with a congressman who's bringing along a little money to get the process started. but the real constituency for the project will be bostonians for generations to come, and one more bridge choked with cars is no gift to them. dante ramos can be reached at dante.ramos@globe.com follow him on facebook: facebook.com/danteramos or on twitter: @danteramos.",['ENGLISH'],604,Copyright 2016 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-97750c22-c527-11e5-9b4b-69e54aa279df,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '28', 'month': '01', 'year': '2016'}",,
,SPORTS; Pg. 41,,Vaughn's HR a major feat,,,"memorial stadium is a sturdy, utilitarian facility that has little to distinguish it except its rich history. opened to major league baseball in 1954, it will be vacated by the orioles after this year, which is why the otherwise sorry team has billed this as, ""a season to remember."" the faded yellow bleachers at the stadium jut out from a bowl of seats that wraps around the playing field, almost as if they were attached as an afterthought. they are more easily reachable than at most stadiums - just 309 feet down the lines - but they stretch a full 43 rows deep, making it virtually impossible to hit one completely out of the yard.","the only man to do it was frank robinson, who, on may 8, 1966, in the second game of a doubleheader, hit a ball off luis tiant that soared over the left-field bleachers and finally rolled to a stop in the back of the parking lot, where it was chased down by kids 540 feet from home plate. robinson, who currently works as an assistant general manager, took a white handkerchief from his pocket in the fifth inning yesterday and wiped his brow in feigned relief that his feat had not been matched by rookie slugger mo vaughn, who had just hit his first major league home run. the hit dog came close, though, really close. leading off the fifth inning against orioles righthander jeff robinson, vaughn unloaded on a fastball and sent it curling like some kind of flaming projectile toward the back of the right-field bleachers, where it struck the palm of a postmaster from chambersburg, pa., in the 38th row of section 30, five rows from the top of the stadium. one inning earlier a woman had fainted because of the heat in the seat where vaughn's ball landed. ""i wasn't even paying attention to who was hitting,"" said trump vandrau, 47, who made the 90-mile trip to see the orioles with family and friends who seemed to be enjoying his brief celebrity. ""then i turned around and it was coming at me. it hit me in the hand and fell right here, and i picked it up.""  the tentative measurement of the blast was 438 feet (the orioles said they might take a tape measure to it today). relatively speaking, manager joe morgan claims to have measured the red seat marking ted williams' home run off fred hutchinson at 452 feet. it was not so much a fly ball as a soaring line drive. the ball's trajectory, not the force behind it, may actually have kept it from leaving the park. ""heck,"" said steve lyons, ""i thought we were gong to have to start the car to find it.""  vaughn acknowledged, ""you catch one or two in a lifetime like that."" the fact that it was his first only made the shot more improbable. but, because he is just 23 years old and has taken only 11 major league at-bats over four games, and because the sox had lost, 6-4, he was almost overly sensitive about putting his awesome achievement above mounting concerns about the team.  ""the home run was great,"" he said. ""nothing can ever match that. to catch a ball like that, everything almost has to be perfect. but the important thing is we got to get out of this rut we're in right now. we got to figure out a way to get out of this.""  vaughn's minor league reputation was sealed two weeks ago, when he snapped his bat in half and hit one out at pawtucket's mccoy stadium. if his first four games are any indication, he will be here a while. although he struck out to end yesterday's game, he also crushed a line drive at second baseman billy ripken in the sixth inning. he has already shown a rare combination of savage power and discipline at the plate. ""i've only seen him three games, but he looks like he's going to be a solid hitter,"" said robinson.  of course, there was nothing to prepare anyone for what he did in the fifth. the sox had failed to score in the first four innings and had looked like their offense was bogged down in the usual problems when vaughn lumbered to the plate against robinson with boston trailing, 1-0.  robinson threw one pitch: a fastball inside. what followed was as loud as any hit you will ever hear. vaughn, who was using one of tom brunansky's 35-inch, 33-ounce bats, unloaded with all the force that is packed into his compact frame.  ""i was just trying to get them to put up another 'here' sign on the other side of the ballpark,"" said jeff robinson, referring to the flag that used to mark the area where frank robinson's shot left the stadium. ""i went into the pitcher's meeting before the game and they said, 'he's got great power inside, but if you get into a situation where he can't hurt us, let's try and see.'  ""well, he's got great power inside. believe me, he's got great power, and it's inside.""  ""it takes a lot of things to go right to hit a ball like that,"" said vaughn. ""you've got to be confident in yourself and, you know, i have confidence in myself. you got to understand that when they release that ball it's yours to attack. if you don't attack it with some confidence and some aggression, then you're on the defensive, and you can't be like that to hit in this league. it's one of those things."" afterward, robinson was smiling. ""a lot of people have come close,"" he said. when he first did it, he said, he thought someone else would come along and do it again. now that time is running out on memorial stadium, however, he said he hopes he will stand alone. ""i really thought that it would happen,"" he said. ""but now that this is the last year, seriously, selfishly, i hope that no one does it again.""",['ENGLISH'],916,Copyright 1991 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '07', 'day': '01', 'year': '1991'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000170', 'className': 'BASEBALL'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DDVK', 'className': 'MIDDLE MANAGEMENT'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY', 'className': 'Parking Facilities'}], 'state': [{'score': '54', 'classCode': 'GS154', 'className': 'PENNSYLVANIA, USA'}]}"

""it's a little bit of excitement in terms of the birth, but also one of success because the mystery was solved,"" aquarium spokesman tony lacasse said. he said aquarium officials had been puzzled by the new arrivals in an all-female exhibit. parthenogenesis is common among plants and insects, the aquarium said, and occurs in the wild. the newborn snakes were spotted by aquarium staff in early january in the anacondas' home in the amazon exhibit, the aquarium said. some of anna's babies were stillborn, which is common with parthenogenesis, according to the aquarium. three survived, but one died in a couple of days. anacondas do not have difficulty reproducing in aquariums, which is why the aquarium doesn't keep a male around, lacasse said. ""when anaconda have young from sexual reproduction, we're talking about having dozens of young at a time,"" lacasse said. ""you can't place that number of animals in facilities."" during a physical examination, anna and the two other adult anacondas were evaluated again and confirmed to be female. the staff also looked at possible delayed embryo implantation, but anna's history was well-documented. she had come to the aquarium when she was young with no previous exposure to any adult male anacondas, the aquarium said. that left one final test: looking at their dna. tissue samples were sent off for testing. weeks later, it was confirmed that the babies were created by parthenogenesis, the aquarium said. not all types of parthenogenesis create exact dna copies with the babies. but the two tiny anacondas appear to be exactly that, lacasse said. ""this is the product of a very unusual process that we needed to go through testing to confirm what we were suspecting,"" lacasse said. the babies have not yet been put in the exhibit and are still being taken care of behind the scenes, lacasse said. they're being held daily by a biologist to make it easier for them later on in life, especially for medical examinations, he said.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,Supreme Court to hear case on using permits to cut emissions,"Industry, states challenge EPA right to set rules",,"washington — industry groups and republican-led states are heading an attack at the supreme court against the obama administration's sole means of trying to limit emissions of gases blamed for global warming. as president obama pledges to act on environmental and other matters when congress does not, or will not, opponents of regulating carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases cast the rule as a power grab of historic proportions. the court will hear arguments monday about a small but important piece of the environmental protection agency's plans to cut the emissions — a requirement that companies expanding industrial facilities or building new ones that would increase overall pollution must also evaluate ways to reduce the carbon they release.","environmental groups and even some of their opponents say that whatever the court decides, the epa still will be able to move forward with broader plans to set emission standards for greenhouse gases for new and existing power plants. but a court ruling against the epa almost undoubtedly would be used to challenge every step of the agency's effort to deal with climate change, said jacob hollinger, a partner with the mcdermott will and emery law firm in new york and a former epa lawyer. ""will they be successful? we don't know yet,"" hollinger said. ""but it would be an important victory in a political sense and, potentially, a practical sense."" republicans have objected strenuously to the administration's decision to push ahead with the regulations after congress failed to pass climate legislation, and after the administration of president george w. bush resisted such steps. both sides agree that it would have been better to deal with climate change through legislation than regulation. in 2012, a three-judge panel of the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit concluded that the epa was ""unambiguously correct"" in using existing federal law to address global warming. monday's case, for which the court has expanded argument time to 90 minutes from the usual 60, stems from the high court's 2007 ruling in massachusetts v. epa, which said the agency has the authority under the clean air act to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from vehicles. two years later, with obama in office, the epa concluded that the release of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases endangered human health and welfare. the administration used that finding to extend its regulatory reach beyond automobiles and develop standards for large stationary sources. of those, electric plants are the largest source of emissions. the administration has proposed first-time national standards for new power plants and expects to propose regulations for existing plants this summer. it will then move on to other large stationary sources such as factories. in the meantime, the only way the epa can compel companies to address global warming pollution is through a permitting program that requires them to analyze the best available technologies to reduce carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas. the utility industry, the us chamber of commerce, and 13 states led by texas are asking the court to rule that the epa overstepped its authority by trying to regulate greenhouse gas emissions through the permitting program. the epa's actions ""represent one of the boldest seizures of legislative authority by an executive agency in history,"" peter keisler, representing the american chemistry council among two dozen manufacturing and industry groups that want the court to throw out the rule, said in court papers. when the supreme court considered the appeals in october, the justices declined requests to consider overruling the court's 2007 decision, review the epa's conclusion about the health effects of emissions, or question limits on vehicle emissions. instead, the court focused on the permitting program, which the epa has said it would apply for the time being only to the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. the more narrow question framed by the court has led environmental advocates to minimize the case's significance. ""twice, the supreme court has affirmed the epa's authority to regulate climate pollution,"" said vickie patton, general counsel for the environmental defense fund. patton was referring to the 2007 decision and the court's 2011 decision that said only the epa, not states and conservation groups, could seek cuts in power plant emissions. in addition to environmental groups, new york, california, illinois, and a dozen other states are supporting the administration. also in support of the regulation is calpine corp., which operates natural gas and geothermal power plants around the nation. calpine said it has gone through the permitting program six times and found it ""neither overly burdensome nor unworkable."" looking at the same program, the us chamber of commerce said it ""may be the costliest, most intrusive regulatory program the nation has yet seen.""",['ENGLISH'],952,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Admiral retires as sub unit disbands,Groton base to see command shift,,"groton, conn. — the top officer at the oldest us submarine base, an admiral whose ties to groton date to his birth, may become the last flag officer to serve here as his submarine group is eliminated in a navy streamlining.","rear admiral kenneth perry, a career submarine officer with responsibility for all 23 us attack submarines on the east coast, is retiring friday at the same ceremony where his submarine group 2 will be formally disestablished. the nuclear-powered submarines assigned to groton are staying put at the naval submarine base, along with the navy's submarine school and medical research laboratory, but it remains unknown whether an admiral will again reside in a city that bills itself as the submarine capital of the world. perry, 53, said in an interview that various submarine squadrons are taking over the command-and-control responsibilities from the group. but he said individual submarine commanders will carry a heavier burden under the streamlining, which is cutting the support staff for attack submarines based in connecticut and virginia by about 50 percent.

""serves you right, girl. now i'll send a call in to your teacher when i get home, and i'll send a call in to your mother. she'll bring you a clean dress. don't you ever walk with your eyes closed. this is not a game here. it's a going-to-school kind of walk i want you to do — eyes open, feet planted one after the other, on the alert. you hear me, boys and girls."" ""yes, ma'am,"" we shouted in unison. miss cox was there in the morning, at noon when we were to walk home for lunch, after lunch when we walked back to school, and at the end of the school day. i was in first grade when i met her. she knew all the children's names except us first-graders, but she learned them fast. i was one of the seven barbaras at our crossing, so miss cox learned our last names. miss cox dressed for the seasons. she wore a ghost costume in october, a pilgrim's hat in november and was mrs. santa in december. in january and february she wore that silly stocking cap with the red pompom that twirled when she stood at the intersection stopping and beckoning cars. in spring she donned rabbit ears. my mother told me miss cox had been ""directing"" for more years than she could remember. she directed until i was in fifth grade. then one february morning she wasn't there. it wasn't the first time. she had the flu one winter; mothers and fathers took her place then. another february she told us she had the chance to go to florida for a whole month, and she said she'd have to go. ""i just can't stand to leave all of you, but florida in february. what an opportunity."" when she wasn't there that morning when i was in fifth grade we decided she must have had another chance to go to florida. weeks later my mother told me a lie. i didn't know it, but it was a good lie then. she said miss cox had gone away to live with her sister, that she was ""getting on"" and it was right for her not to live alone anymore.

""he's never even had a speeding ticket before,"" said his wife, patricia. he'll be in court dec. 15 for a pretrial hearing. in this time of fiscal crisis, do you really want your tax dollars squandered and your courts burdened over some poor schmoe who failed to get a $ 5 leaf permit? where is judge wapner when we need him? let's drop in on another leafy suburb, wellesley, where parents are upset because two middle school buses have vanished, victims of the same fiscal crisis mentioned above. the result is that 140 children who were riding the bus 10 days ago are no longer eligible. to save $ 36,000, the school committee voted to eliminate the buses as part of $ 180,000 in cuts. school officials are explaining to furious parents whose schedules are suddenly disrupted that they are only enforcing state law, which says that children who live two or more miles from school are entitled to bus service. and there's the rub. before, wellesley had bused all kids who lived 1.5 miles or farther, which, officials point out, was more generous than the law requires. at a special town meeting, a member moved that the buses be kept, but no dice - yet another example of people wanting the services without paying the freight. school officials have been flooded with requests for remeasurement of the distance between home and school. engineers in cars ""with highly specialized odometers"" trace the precise route a child would walk, crossing fields if necessary, said assistant superintendent paul ash. in some cases, it's a matter of yards, even feet. not only are middle school parents upset, parents of children who go to st. john's, a parochial school, have hired a lawyer and plan to sue the town. state law says private school kids are entitled to the same busing as public school kids. but instead of being bused straight to their school, st. john's kids are now bused to the middle school, where they transfer to shuttle buses. a spokesman for the parents, tom hennessey, said his children live 2.5 miles from st. john's but are now bused 4.8 miles to the middle school, then another 2.5 miles to st. john's. parents are upset because studies show the riskiest part of a bus ride is the loading zone. ""our kids are getting on and off buses eight times a day,"" hennessey said. so now, parents all over town are asking: who's off and who's on? do you measure door-to-door or sidewalk-to-sidewalk? some have hired a van at $ 600 a head. one parent has appealed to the state department of education; officials are coming out today to watch engineers remeasure his route. another parent who appealed a measurement inadvertently caused seven neighborhood children to get knocked off the bus when his remeasurement was done; word has it the parents aren't speaking to him. working mothers are particularly panic-stricken. car pools are forming. there's even been one arrest. a st. john's parent followed the bus last week and claimed it was speeding. the bus driver reported the parent was harassing him. police charged the parent with disturbing the peace. he was handcuffed, put in a jail cell, his belt removed. personally, i think the irate parent and the leaf dumper should get together for a strategy session.",['ENGLISH'],743,Copyright 1989 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '11', 'day': '08', 'year': '1989'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '85', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '85', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Administration & Operation'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001930', 'className': 'CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY4Mzk5NDNDRjMzNEEwREE1RTU3NkM0QjAyQkEwNTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUUwRTU3NTU1NkRGNDlBQTkzQkRCM0RFQTZENTlBMUY', 'className': 'Driving Under the Influence'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000861', 'className': 'HOME SECURITY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000535', 'className': 'CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZEMjUxMkJBNUI0NDExM0FFRkI5RkYwRUUyM0ZGMzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'Student Transportation'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000D7G9', 'className': 'MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'STX001544', 'className': 'SECURITY & ALARM SYSTEMS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DFRN', 'className': 'EMERGENCY VEHICLES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001175', 'className': 'MOTORCOACHES & BUSES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N485410MM', 'className': 'SCHOOL & EMPLOYEE BUS SERVICES'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000D7G9', 'className': 'MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX001174', 'className': 'MOTOR VEHICLES'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'STX001544', 'className': 'SECURITY & ALARM SYSTEMS'}]}"

,METRO/REGION; Pg. 25 p,,Clinic goes to school;,,,"a doctor's appointment is an old and easy excuse for missing school. at boston high school, however, the excuse rarely works. last september, the school in the south end opened an in-house health clinic in association with new england medical center. the goal was to reduce the increasing number of days that students missed school because of health problems, and to curb a high dropout rate from pregnancies.","nearly 60 percent of the students at boston high are at risk for alcohol and drug abuse, school officials estimate, and 50 percent have serious and chronic medical and dental needs. those factors, combined with poverty, often mean that students do not have access to a doctor or dentist. for the collaborative effort, funded in part by the state department of public health and grants from such philanthropic organizations as the boston foundation, boston high has partitioned off a large, empty classroom on the second floor, where staff from new england medical center began providing health care and counseling for hundreds of students. this week, the clinic and the school celebrated the success of the pilot program along with the completion of alterations for the clinic. ""wow!"" exclaimed omega hancock, 18, as she reflected on the care she has received at the clinic. ""we never had nothing like this."" brighton high school has the only other such clinic in the city, and there are only eight more statewide. ""we want to provide meaningful health care so students attend school,"" said thomas hennessey, the headmaster. ""you can't teach to empty seats."" because of prenatal care and pregnancy counseling provided by the crittenton hastings house, many so-called 'parenting students' are encouraged to stay in school. ""they're sticking it out,"" said hennessey. ""it doesn't mean we're 100 percent successful - we're not."" there are no hard figures showing a decrease in dropout rates, but school staff say they have noticed more teen-age parents attending classes. nearly 20 percent of the female students at boston high are likely to become pregnant, while 40 percent of the school's enrollment is at risk of dropping out. it is not only pregnancy that keeps students out of school. general bad health adds up to lots of lost time in the classroom, teachers and doctors say. ""many students haven't seen a medical person in years,"" said geralyn hall, the nurse practitioner at the clinic. with a health-care facility on the premises, staff people are able to monitor students' conditions, helping them become and stay well. ""we're picking up things a lot sooner,"" said hall, who added that she can determine students' medical histories and identify their long-term health concerns, including dental and nutritional problems. counseling is ""one of the biggest needs of the students,"" said dr. john kulig, a physician at boston high from new england medical center. the clinic is developing a peer leadership counseling program to deal with the many problems teen-agers face today, such as drug abuse, aids prevention and violence.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,"India's COVID surge a flashback, and warning","'It's like experiencing what Boston went through,' only much worse.",,"for many in the health care field, india's tragic coronavirus surge — fueling a world-record 352,991 reported cases on monday alone — is a painful flashback to the darkest days of 2020 when the virus rampaged through massachusetts and parts of the united states. but it's also a reminder that, while more than 42 percent of the american population has had at least one vaccine shot, immunization has barely begun in many parts of the world; fewer than 10 percent of indians have received a shot. it's also a stark warning that new waves of covid-19 or a vaccine-eluding variant could emerge in unvaccinated regions and threaten the united states until most of the global population is inoculated. ""you're seeing a case of the virus overwhelming the indian health care system, and these new [virus] strains are driving the lethality,"" said dr. atul gawande, the boston surgeon, writer, and public health researcher, who has been advocating for us aid to india.","body ""it's like experiencing what boston went through in march and especially april of last year,"" gawande said, though in a nation four times more populous than the united states and with a far less robust health care system. ""it's critical for us to increase [vaccine] supplies and release supplies to the rest of the world."" massachusetts doctors and public health leaders — some of whom, like gawande, have relatives stricken by the virus in india — have called on the biden administration to send india personal protective equipment, oxygen tubes for hospitals, and raw materials key to making vaccines, such as adjuvants that boost the body's immune response to injections. federal officials said monday that the united states will share doses of astrazeneca's vaccine — about 10 million doses have been stockpiled here but not yet authorized for domestic use — with india and other countries once the vaccine has cleared federal safety reviews. that followed a white house announcement on sunday that it was ""working around the clock"" to deploy covid-19 therapeutics and testing kits, as well as ventilators, protective gear, and other supplies. many health care professionals in massachusetts have signed an open letter to president biden urging the us government to waive patent protection for vaccine makers, require them to share know-how with developing countries to speed mass production of vaccines, and help finance overseas manufacturing plants. ""because india is so enormous and has such an impact on the global economy, it's waking people up in a way that a surge in sierra leone would not,"" said dr. joia mukherjee, chief medical officer at partners in health in boston, who works with clinical teams around the world. ""as well as we're doing [with vaccines] in the us, it's going to be meaningless if the virus is still spreading and the global economy is still stuck in the mud."" india reported 2,812 deaths monday, bringing the official death toll now over 195,000. experts say the surge won't peak for several weeks — monday was the fifth day in a row india has broken the record for most cases in one country. the closely watched model from the university of washington forecasts a staggering toll of nearly 1 million deaths in india by aug. 1. ""we need to urgently slow transmission in india, and we need to prevent as many deaths as possible,"" said dr. abraar karan, a global health physician at brigham and women's hospital in boston, who has worked as a public health researcher in indian villages and has family members there who have been hospitalized with covid-19. ""with exponential spread, every day there is worse than the last day."" karan said india's actual toll is almost certainly much higher than its official toll. ""people die in homes, people die in villages, people die in places that can not be detected,"" he said. while the situation in india is the world's most dire, global health advocates say it's also a cautionary tale. ""there's a humanitarian concern right now in india, and a warning of what might happen in other places,"" said dr. louise ivers, executive director of the center for global health at massachusetts general hospital. ""we are not safe until everyone is safe."" only a handful of countries have reported substantial shares of their population vaccinated. fewer than 1 percent of people have gotten a covid-19 shot in africa, fewer than 4 percent in asia, and just over 11 percent in south america, according to oxford university data. india is one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines, but the explosion of cases linked to variants has overwhelmed the nation's capacity. both the b.1.1.7 variant first identified in the united kingdom and the b.1.617 variant first seen in india itself are spreading rapidly there. also driving the indian outbreak have been relaxed restrictions that led people to mingle at political rallies and religious events and low vaccine coverage. just 1.6 percent of people in india are fully vaccinated, according to a new york times database. dr. peter hotez, dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine, welcomed the news that the united states will share its stock of astrazeneca vaccines with india and raw materials to make doses there. however, he warned, ""it's still a drop in the bucket, given the task at hand."" a vaccine that hotez helped develop at the baylor and texas children's hospital center for vaccine development recently received approval to enter a late-stage trial in india. if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective, he said, the indian company that licensed it, vaccine-maker biological e. ltd., has the capacity to produce 1 billion doses for worldwide distribution, including in india. earlier this year, numerous countries were counting on the serum institute of india, which makes 60 percent of the world's vaccines each year, to provide covid-19 doses. but now the institute is having difficulty meeting demands at home. serum had promised to supply 1.1 billion doses of an indian-made version of the astrazeneca vaccine called covishield by may to a group called covax for distribution. but the institute had only exported 19.6 million vaccine doses to covax, the government said earlier this month. none of the companies that make the covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in the united states — pfizer and its german partner biontech, moderna, and johnson & johnson — have deals to sell doses to india. but pfizer said last thursday that it had offered india a not-for-profit price for its vaccine and was in talks with the indian government about distributing it. dr. ingrid katz, an associate physician at brigham and women's, wrote recently in the new england journal of medicine that it will take more than four and a half years to inject enough people globally to suppress the virus at the current rate of vaccinations. ""vaccine distribution remains nonexistent in many of the poorest countries, and experts anticipate that 80 percent of the population in low-resource settings will not receive a vaccine this year,"" katz and a trio of colleagues wrote. katz, in an interview, said the flare-up in india underscores the need for the united states and other wealthy nations to shift quickly from ""vaccine nationalism"" to ""vaccine equity,"" and recognize the global dimension of the coronavirus pandemic. ""this virus came to us from halfway around the world, and there's no reason to think it won't come around again,"" she said. ►the united states intends to share astrazeneca vaccine doses with other nations. a3 ryan huddle of the globe staff contributed to this story.",['ENGLISH'],1293,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-8c711f68a6eb11eb9340fa4f6fba680c,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '27', 'month': '04', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTY', 'className': 'CORONAVIRUSES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002059', 'className': 'DISEASE REPORTING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009EVP', 'className': 'MEDICAL SCIENCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001880', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002145', 'className': 'VIRUSES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N621399CC', 'className': 'HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DM8Y', 'className': 'BUSINESS NEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000797', 'className': 'GLOBALIZATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DP5A', 'className': 'PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008X7D', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING FACILITIES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001957', 'className': 'POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000483', 'className': 'DEVELOPING COUNTRIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DO36', 'className': 'HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009EVK', 'className': 'MEDICINE & HEALTH'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DHVK', 'className': 'PROFESSIONAL WORKERS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001937', 'className': 'ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001301', 'className': 'PATENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002149', 'className': 'HEALTH CARE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001911', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS & BIOTECHNOLOGY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001323', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009T96'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N325414MM', 'className': 'BIOLOGICS MFG'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N621399CC', 'className': 'HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002014', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N325412MM', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DPQ2', 'className': 'DRUG AVAILABILITY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008X7D', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING FACILITIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DO36', 'className': 'HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC304', 'className': 'INDIA'}, {'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC557', 'className': 'SIERRA LEONE'}]}"
,ECONOMY; Pg. 77,,What ails nursing?,,,"the red saab turns sharply around the corner into leonard morse hospital, almost hitting helen moore as she tries to hand the driver a leaflet. for moore, the incident seems fitting. as a veteran nurse at the hospital, she feels as if she is under assault. rumors about layoffs are in the air. and nurses worry that the hospital's plan for a new ""patient care model"" is nothing more than a ploy to replace them with cheaper labor. ""we're the ones who built this hospital,"" moore said as she joined other nurses at an informational picket line last week. ""now they want to let us go.""","like the other players in medicine, nurses are learning that they are not immune from the financial ills of the health care system. just a few years after they were being recruited to a recession-proof career with promises of big pay increases, nurses are encountering a very different world. boston university hospital and the brigham & women's hospital announced nursing layoffs recently, although there is still a chance that the cutbacks might be avoided. beth israel and deaconess hospitals have asked nurses to defer scheduled raises to save costs. at a number of hospitals, contract talks with nurses have dragged on for months, with the the two sides unable to agree on issues of pay and job security. picket lines are cropping up in front of hospitals like spring flowers. and the hard times are hitting just as the clinton administration is talking about expanding the role of nursing. in the reform plan that's due out next month, nurses may be asked to take on primary care duties that once were the domain of doctors. all of that may happen. in the meantime, nurses are nervous about the future. ""it's hard to be objective about change when you think your job may disappear,"" said therese smaha, a specialist in nursing issues for the massachusetts hospital association.  nurses are feeling the squeeze after a period of tremendous gains. in the 1980s and early 1990s, their ranks grew rapidly, and so did their paychecks. the average salary of a registered hospital nurse climbed from $ 26,000 in 1987 to $ 42,000 in 1992, according to the massachusetts hospital association.  in the peak years of 1988 and 1989, nursing salaries rose more than 15 percent a year. a nurse at a major boston teaching hospital can make more than $ 65,000 a year. salaries are lower at smaller hospitals, and considerably lower in nursing homes.  nurses have benefited from the law of supply and demand. a nursing shortage in the middle and late 1980s forced hospitals to bid wages up to attract more nurses. some hospitals offered prizes, like trips to bermuda and vcrs, for tips that led to the hiring of a nurse.  capitalism worked. nursing school enrollment soared, former nurses returned to work and the vacancy rate at hospitals dropped sharply. ""the nursing shortage doesn't exist anymore,"" said thomas lynch, executive vice president at newton-wellesley hospital.  instead, a patient shortage has developed. a combination of improved technology and steady pressure from health insurers has cut both admissions and lengths of stay at most massachusetts hospitals. boston university hospital, for instance, had more than 89,000 patient days in 1991. this year, the hospital expects to have just over 85,000. ""nurses will scoff at that and say they are busier than ever, but the facts don't bear them out,"" said maura mitchell, the hospital's vice president for nursing. the hospital plans to lay off about two dozen nurses, unless the union agrees to give up pay increases.  hospitals looking to cut expenses aren't ignoring nursing. at a typical hospital, nursing salaries and benefits can easily amount to 20 percent of total costs.  so far, most hospitals are trying to avoid layoffs by holding the line on wage increases. both newton-wellesley and faulkner hospital in boston have proposed not giving cost-of-living increases to nurses. instead, they would get a one-time bonus and normal pay increases for seniority. at several hospitals, management is trying to eliminate special weekend programs that were created during the shortage years. thus, nurses willing to work 12 hours on saturday and sunday are paid for a 36-hour week, and the hospitals say the incentive is costly and no longer necessary. the massachusetts nurses association, which represents nurses at many local hospitals, says giving it up would cause a hardship. more contentious than money issues are those of job security. specifically worrisome, nurses say, is the growing use of nurse technicians, another vestige of the shortage era. when nurses were hard to find, some hospitals began hiring lower-paid technicians to perform routine duties - giving baths, taking temperature and blood pressure - that don't require true nursing skills. the technicians take an 8- or 10-week training course at the hospital and are paid about $ 10 an hour; top-scale nurses can make more than $ 30 an hour in boston. ""they aren't there to help us, but to replace us,"" karen higgins said last week as she led a picket line of nurses outside boston university hospital. higgins and her colleagues marched in front of the hospital carrying signs that read: ""nurses are the solution, not the problem,"" and, ""who is caring for you?"" the nurses at bu hospital say it is continuing to hire technicians even as nurses are being laid off. they say further that the use of the technicians, who are unlicensed, compromises the quality of patient care. ""they can't replace us at the bedside with people who have minimal experience,"" higgins said. the hospital denies that care has suffered, or that technicians are replacing nurses. the number of technicians has grown only modestly over the past two years, according to a hospital executive. at other hospitals, administrators say technicians and others who are not nurses will play a bigger role, and that over time, the number of nurses in a given hospital will decline. ""nurses have to identify the tasks that don't require their level of expertise and give up those tasks to others,"" said judy miller, senior vice president for patient-care services at new england deaconess. such a strategy, miller said, will save money and free up nurses to work on the more interesting and satisfying part of nursing.  both metrowest medical center in framingham and winchester hospital are moving to new models of care that use nurses more sparingly. they insist the changes are not a threat to nursing, but they make no bones about the fact that efficiency is one of their goals. ""we have to recognize that our resources are limited,"" said ruth stark, director of public relations at metrowest. nurses are not defense workers or steelworkers. demand for their services is not going to disappear. even as jobs get cut in hospitals, new ones will open up in clinics, home health care and health maintenance organizations. nearly all labor market surveys predict that employment in nursing will continue to grow for the rest of the decade. those who are bullish about nursing's future see nurses moving up, performing more demanding and professional tasks. ""once we go through a transition period, nursing will have a stronger role,"" said judy miller of the deaconess. perhaps. but for now, nurses must cope with rising insecurity. ""i was going to retire at my hospital in 32 years,"" said a young nurse who lost her job recently at a boston teaching hospital. finding a new job is not that easy now, she said. finding one at a comparable salary may be impossible. back at the picket line at leonard morse, helen moore is worried. she hands leaflets to anyone who will take them.  several nurses standing nearby hold up red, white and blue balloons. one carries a sign that says, ""honk for nurses."" the hospital merged with framingham hospital last year to form metrowest medical center. to moore and others, the merger looks more like a takeover. one department, pediatrics, has already moved to framingham. others could follow, she said. moore has worked at leonard morse for 20 years. when she started, nurses were paid $ 4 an hour; top pay today is nearly $ 23 an hour. ""finally we are making not great money, but a fair income,"" she said.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Slower consumer spending may reflect anxiety over pay,Modest gain after robust 1st quarter,,"washington - americans increased their spending more slowly in march, suggesting some are worried that their paychecks aren't growing quickly enough. the commerce department said monday that consumer spending increased just 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.9 percent in february.","income grew 0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in february, but after-tax income when adjusted for inflation increased just 0.2 percent in march. the gain followed two months of declines. consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, rose 2.9 percent in the january-march quarter - the fastest pace in more than a year. the increase was a bright spot in an otherwise weak first quarter for economic growth. but paul dales, senior us economist at capital economics, noted that stronger spending in january and february drove the quarterly increase. and consumers spent more while saving less, which suggests they cannot sustain their spending pace without better pay. ""real incomes will need to grow at a faster rate to prevent consumption growth from slowing,"" dales said. he noted that friday's report on april hiring is a crucial sign of where the economy is headed. the government reported friday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the january-march quarter. that's down from 3 percent annual growth in the october-december period. the weakness mainly reflected government budget-cutting and weaker business investment. in march, consumers spent 0.9 percent more on nondurable goods, such as clothing. spending on durable goods, such as cars and appliances, fell 0.3 percent. spending on services such as utilities and rent was mostly flat. an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in march. over the past 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the federal reserve's 2 percent inflation target after-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months compared with a year earlier. that was the smallest pay increase in two years. the savings rate edged up to 3.8 percent in march, after dropping to a 30-month low of 3.7 percent of after-tax income in february. a healthy job market could reinvigorate consumers. but the economy created just 120,000 jobs - half the pace of the previous three months. economists predict employers added 163,000 jobs this month, slightly better than march's figures but below the pace from december through february. one positive change since the winter: gas prices appear to have peaked. that would give consumers more to spend elsewhere. the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $3.81 on monday, down 8 cents from a month ago, according to aaa's fuel gauge report.",['ENGLISH'],451,Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-20c62de0-9303-11e1-9c8c-e2489c97f594,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '01', 'month': '05', 'year': '2012'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Tax Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00090NT', 'className': 'ECONOMIC CONDITIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000551', 'className': 'ECONOMIC NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000550', 'className': 'ECONOMIC GROWTH'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002009', 'className': 'CONSUMER SPENDING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000913', 'className': 'INFLATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000540', 'className': 'DURABLE GOODS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000549', 'className': 'ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000383', 'className': 'CONSUMPTION'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001627', 'className': 'STATISTICS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX002023', 'className': 'LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008X0U', 'className': 'ECONOMIC SURVEYS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CC', 'className': 'COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0008X90', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING OUTPUT'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001242', 'className': 'OIL & GAS PRICES'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST0009GJU', 'className': 'GASOLINE PRICES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000382', 'className': 'CONSUMER SPENDING & CREDIT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002009', 'className': 'CONSUMER SPENDING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000540', 'className': 'DURABLE GOODS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000218', 'className': 'BUDGETS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0008X90', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING OUTPUT'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001242', 'className': 'OIL & GAS PRICES'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST0009GJU', 'className': 'GASOLINE PRICES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000CTLO', 'className': 'BUDGET CUTS'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",HEALTH SCIENCE,,TRICK OR TREATMENT?,, JUDY FOREMAN ,"a spate of recent studies reinforces the idea that what we think about our medical care really can affect our health. the new research into the power of placebos is giving scientists new insights into how patients' expectations their beliefs about whether an inactive, sham treatment will work can have an actual, observable effect on their well-being. in one small study, volunteers with jaw pain were repeatedly injected with what they were told was a pain drug but in reality was nothing but salt water, yet pet scans showed that after every injection, their brains produced endorphins natural, opiate-like painkillers.","the men's beliefs about the treatment caused changes in the brains and reduced their perception of pain, said dr. jon-kar zubieta, the study leader and associate professor of psychiatry and radiology at the university of michigan medical school. the placebo effect can work in reverse, too, through its evil twin, the ""nocebo"" effect. at least 25 percent of the time, when people take an inactive placebo they report experiencing side effects like headache, insomnia, and fatigue, said dr. arthur barsky, a psychiatrist at brigham and women's hospital. in other words, telling patients about potential side effects can make it more likely that they'll occur. and last week, harvard researchers reported that sham acupuncture provides more pain relief than a sugar pill that comes with a promise of relief. the conclusion to draw from the study, said researcher ted kaptchuk, is that medical ritual ""may be a critical component"" of treatment. the work on placebos will help researchers determine precisely what their drugs are doing and what the contribution of the placebo effect is for healing though it's still unclear precisely how best to harness the placebo effect to make patients feel better. ""the whole point of all this is, how do we capitalize on the placebo response,"" said dr. helen mayberg, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at emory university school of medicine. the research shows that it's not possible to ""psych yourself"" into making a drug work. but not trusting your care whether it's popping a pill handed to you by a doctor or undergoing 30 minutes of treatment from an alternative medicine practitioner is likely to undermine any benefits. ""this is not about the power of positive thinking, it's about positive expectations,"" mayberg said. ""i can't think myself well, but if you go in with a new treatment and say, `this is not going to work,' it probably won't help you."" in general, from 30 to 60 percent of patients with everything from arthritis to depression report an improvement in symptoms after receiving a placebo. one-third of depressed people feel better after taking placebos, while 50 to 60 percent of those taking antidepressants do, said dr. andrew leuchter, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the university of california, los angeles. ""the placebo effect is the summation of all the things we do in treatment that help people get better that are not part of a known specific treatment,"" he said. ""i define it that broadly because when we interact with someone in a positive way, when we give them encouragement and support, and also when they become part of the healthcare system no longer sitting at home ill, but in a milieu where they are getting treatment we tap into positive expectations."" the effects of placebos wear off with time, but real drugs keep on working. because of this and medical ethics no one is suggesting that doctors prescribe their patients sugar pills or sham treatments. but combining real medicines with the ""placebo effect"" does more than either can alone. ""the take-home message is that when you get an active drug, you get the effect of the drug itself and the placebo effect,"" said michigan's zubieta. the newest research, much of it based on brain imaging techniques, provides direct evidence of how the placebo effect works. the research will help scientists determine more precisely the contributions of the ""placebo response"" to the effectiveness of medications. some other recent findings: columbia university researcher tor wager has used brain scans to map where in the brain the placebo response occurs. it turns out that those areas including the thalamus, the insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex are also among the areas activated when a person is in pain. the placebo effect can even kick in when there's no placebo, according to dr. fabrizio benedetti, a professor at the university of turin. in one study, benedetti hooked pain patients to a computerized injection device. in some cases, the computer administered morphine without the patients knowing it, and in others, a doctor gave the drug in full view. the hidden therapy was much less effective than the open one, showing that to get the most from a treatment, you have to know you're getting it. similarly, parkinson's patients improved more when they were told doctors were activating a stimulator in their brains than when the stimulator was turned on without their knowing it, benedetti showed. in alzheimer's patients, however, the italian team found the expectation of pain relief did not reduce the perception of pain, suggesting that a mostly healthy brain is required for the placebo effect to work. though all this makes for compelling research, it's still unclear what it means to patients and their doctors. ""that's the new frontier,"" harvard's kaptchuk said. what is clear is that having a reasonably positive attitude that a new treatment will work can at least stack the odds in your favor, and not focusing on all the possible side effects makes sense, too. it's also essential to pick a healthcare provider you trust so that his or her words of encouragement about a treatment can boost the chance it will work for you.",['ENGLISH'],966,Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-0602060148,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '06', 'month': '02', 'year': '2006'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FY9', 'className': 'EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001477', 'className': 'RESEARCH REPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002119', 'className': 'PSYCHIATRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000115', 'className': 'ARTHRITIS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000074', 'className': 'ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D8KZ', 'className': 'NEUROSCIENCE'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX002052', 'className': 'DEPRESSION'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N621399QC', 'className': 'PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8W', 'className': 'GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N611310MM', 'className': 'MEDICAL EDUCATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002119', 'className': 'PSYCHIATRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000074', 'className': 'ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001323', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DKDL', 'className': 'ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N621399QC', 'className': 'PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008XSI', 'className': 'ANTIDEPRESSANTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000084', 'className': 'ANALGESICS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000273', 'className': 'CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DRUGS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8W', 'className': 'GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N622310JM', 'className': 'MATERNITY HOSPITALS'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS138', 'className': 'MICHIGAN, USA'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",METRO,,From N.H. to Somalia: Recalling a suspect's zeal,,Charles A. Radin Globe Staff,"methuen - daniel maldonado, a slender young man in his early 20s with tattoos and dreadlocks, entered the selimiye mosque in a densely populated neighborhood of central methuen with a humble request for help converting to islam. but as his commitment to ever purer, more intense religious observance deepened over the next several years, he became critical of other muslims' observance of the faith, until the imam who helped him convert told him to refrain from judging others or to leave the mosque.  maldonado, on the road to the islamic fundamentalism that would ultimately lead him to somalia, decided to leave.","soner uguz knew maldonado, who has taken the name daniel aljughaifi, from the beginning of his journey into islam. ""i met danny the week he converted, about seven years ago,"" said uguz, identified by worshipers at the mosque yesterday as maldonado's best friend. ""he was cool. he dressed in t-shirts and jeans and didn't hide any of his tattoos. his hair was in dreadlocks. he was eager, and he had a lot of questions."" all that changed radically. last week in a federal court in houston, where he had been living for a while before he went overseas, maldonado became the first us citizen to be charged with participating in terrorist activities in somalia. maldonado, who grew up in pelham, n.h., and later lived in methuen, became immersed in islam and attended prayer sessions regularly at selimiye mosque. he began wearing traditional arab clothing, including the galabeyah, an ankle-length gown with long sleeves that covered the tattoos on his arms. he struggled to grow the beard of a religious muslim. when he could not, he blamed his puerto rican heritage and began chastising fellow muslims who could grow a full beard and chose not to. his wife dressed in a burkah, exposing only her eyes, and wore gloves in public. the couple's daughter, a toddler at the time, wore the hijab headcovering, though under most interpretations of muslim law this practice is required only after a girl reaches puberty. they renamed their son, anthony, as mohammed. he was no longer the eager and humble young man he had been when he entered the mosque for the first time around 2000. ""he was arrogant; he knew the book [the koran] better than anyone,"" uguz said at the mosque yesterday afternoon after prayers. ""he went from loving rap to hating poetry."" another worshiper at the mosque - matthew yusuf trombly, who like maldonado is 28 and a convert to islam from christianity - said maldonado fell victim to ""the zeal of the convert."" within the congregation, trombly said, ""the general attitude was that he was just learning islam and maybe trying to do too much too fast and got confused. still, ""he was friendly,"" trombly said. ""he came across as a street kid, and that was charming in a way. you don't run into kids like danny maldonado every day. he had a lot of charisma. ""people say that when he first came he loved music and would talk about how much he loved rap,"" trombly said. ""but by the time i really got to know him, in 2004, you would never mention music to him. you knew what you were going to get"" - a lecture on sin. opinionated, outspoken, and charismatic also are the words chosen to describe maldonado in his high school days by dorothy mohr, principal of pelham high school in pelham, n.h., where maldonado dropped out in february 1997, during his junior year. ""danny was always an outspoken student, though i use the word student lightly,"" mohr said. ""he'd show up late for class, without the materials or homework, but he would know what we were talking about. then he would go off on a tangent and get adamant about it."" maldonado's intensity then was directed at political subjects, not religion, she said. he was not a member of a group and had no involvement in school activities that mohr could recall. but ""kids would willingly listen to him,"" she said. ""they'd never say to him, `be quiet; you don't know what you're talking about.' he had charisma."" maldonado also had brushes with the local police, but there was nothing serious or suggestive of his alleged turn toward terrorism. ""it was traffic violations and typical high school things, loud house parties and things like that,"" said captain joseph roark of the pelham police department. still, roark said, he wonders now what was going on in maldonado's head as he made his way through adolescence. ""he was a bit detached, kind of distant,"" roark said. friends at the mosque also saw a dreamer in maldonado. ""he used to tell me he wanted to get a visa and live in yemen because they spoke the purest arabic there,"" uguz said. ""we told him to cut it out - we never thought he'd do it, for the sake of the kids."" maldonado did not go to yemen to live. but in august 2005 he left massachusetts and moved to houston. then in november of that year he moved to egypt with his wife and three children. a year later, according to an affidavit by the fbi agent who filed the terrorism charges against maldonado in houston last week, he moved to somalia, where he underwent military training and studied bomb-making. he is scheduled to appear in federal court to face those charges on tuesday. conviction could mean life imprisonment. according to an affidavit filed in us district court for the southern district of texas, maldonado said he would have ""no problem"" killing americans because he was angry with the united states and said he had ""no problem"" with the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. the houston chronicle said yesterday that maldonado's wife, tamekia cunningham, died of a high fever probably caused by malaria during the couple's time in east africa. the newspaper, which did not identify its sources, said the couple's children have been brought by us officials to their grandparents in new england. relatives of maldonado who live in londonderry, n.h., declined to comment thursday. the muslims who gathered to talk about maldonado after prayers in the methuen mosque yesterday afternoon said they were worried that what maldonado is alleged to have done would reflect badly on islam and their mosque. ""we saw him as a person who was into studying, rather than physical jihad,"" trombly said. ""but everything about him changed, so i can't say i am completely surprised."" charles a. radin can be reached at radin@globe.com.",['ENGLISH'],1048,Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5729013,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '17', 'month': '02', 'year': '2007'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A0DV', 'className': 'FUNDAMENTALISM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CPBD', 'className': 'QURAN & ISLAMIC TEXTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000855', 'className': 'HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Terrorism'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}], 'city': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'GX591', 'className': 'HOUSTON, TX, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'GS145', 'className': 'NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC558', 'className': 'SOMALIA'}]}"

""it was more about making do with what you have,"" said the 28-year-old bynum, who currently works as a financial analyst at raytheon. ""i didn't have a track, but that didn't stop me from loving the sport that i love. i just loved going out there and competing."" bynum's personal success came just in time. in 2010, salem state eliminated its men's and women's track-and-field programs due to budget cuts on campus and the low numbers of participation on both teams. bynum came to salem state without a long history in track. he only joined the outdoor program at english as a junior before competing both indoors and outdoors as a senior. at salem state, he blossomed into a regionally and nationally ranked sprinter, earning six all-american honors, and also representing salem state at the 2008 ncaa outdoor championships in both the 100 and 200 meters. the local athlete competing for a small state school left his mark. ""for a lot of those teams at the national level, you could tell they had [15, 20 kids], and i just thought, 'here i am, just the lonely one,' "" bynum said, laughing. ""but i knew i wanted to win, and cement my place at salem state."" downie, a brighton native who attended north cambridge catholic, also cemented his legacy. also recruited by northeastern, downie starred at salem state for two seasons after his transfer from bunker hill community college. he was the mascac's player of the year twice and earned division 3 all-american honors as a senior after powering the vikings to a 24-3 mark and the second round of the ncaa tournament. he averaged 20.6 points per game in two seasons. division 1 or division 3, downie was not going to take his role on a college basketball program for granted. ""i worked harder than the 12th guy on the bench,"" said downie, who is currently a program assistant for boston scholar athletes, after a semipro career with the manchester millrats and boston blizzard. ""i was in the gym every day lifting and shooting, and making sure everything was taken care of."" it's a bull's-eye for trap shooter jesse haynes-lewis was a four-year lineman on the football team at swampscott high. he also played baseball for two years. but last week, the nahant teen returned from colorado springs with a national championship in tow after capturing a junior olympic title in double trap. an olympic sport since 1996, the double trap involves shooting at two clay targets simultaneously. the 18-year-old haynes-lewis edged logan mountain of palmdale, calif., 8-7, in a shootoff. ""i've been shooting competitively for four years — and the double trap for two,"" haynes-lewis said, in response to his ability to compete under pressure. ""so i've done a lot of mental training. i think the majority of sports is mental — and [it's] even more [important] in shooting."" with the win, haynes-lewis earned a spot on the junior national team, which is the next step in the progression to the national team and a possible run at olympic qualification. haynes-lewis is headed to the university of massachusetts lowell this fall. odds and ends shawn thornton, formerly the athletic director at mystic valley regional charter school in malden, has accepted the same position at greater lawrence tech. the bridgewater state college graduate received his master's degree from northeastern university and has worked as athletic director and girls' basketball coach at saint clement and pope john. . . . seabrook, n.h.'s ashante little, a recent graduate of wheaton college, has been offered a semipro membership by the world athletics center in phoenix for the 2014-2015 season. the center is a training organization that features coaching, support, and education for elite track-and-field participants. at wheaton, little was a two-time ncaa national champion, a 16-time ncaa all-american, and the ncaa 400-meter outdoor national champion in 2013, as well as the ncaa 400-meter indoor national champion in 2014. jeff powalisz can be reached at jcpowalisz@yahoo.com",['ENGLISH'],1065,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-13e9017a-0d0d-11e4-beef-76b0b744398a,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '20', 'month': '07', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Commercial Law (UCC)', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI5QjdCNzBDNjY0NEY3QzlGRTNCQTMzQ0IwQ0MzRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C9ZK', 'className': 'COLLEGIATE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CNT2', 'className': 'RUNNING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001529', 'className': 'TRACK & FIELD'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001707', 'className': 'TENNIS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001500', 'className': 'RISK MANAGEMENT'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C9ZK', 'className': 'COLLEGIATE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001500', 'className': 'RISK MANAGEMENT'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX000218', 'className': 'BUDGETS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000CTLO', 'className': 'BUDGET CUTS'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,The focus of vacation selfies is at issue,,,"top: abigail austin in portugal in 2013. at left: high school students (from left) isabela gettier, elizabeth thomas, hannah whitt linsly, and stephanie kirby take a group selfie on a trip to the galapagos this year. new york — jacquie whitt's trip to the galapagos with a group of teenagers was memorable not just for the scenery and wildlife, but also for the way the kids preserved their memories. it was, said whitt, a ""selfie fest.""","body for this generation, ""digital devices are now part of the interpretive experience,"" said whitt, cofounder of adios adventure travel. indeed, many parents love seeing their kids taking selfies and posting to social media when they travel. it shows ""they are engaged and excited about where they are and what they are doing,"" said susan austin, a photographer and iowa mom. ""to some, it might be bragging, but i think it's more about a way today's teens connect with and feel part of a group."" but some adults think there's a downside to vacation selfies. they see them as narcissistic distractions that can detract from the travel experience. and they point to controversial examples — like a smiling selfie from auschwitz posted to twitter — as proof of the potential for poor judgment when young travelers use social media. in addition, when traveling teens spend time taking selfies, ""they're so busy documenting, i wonder whether they're actually experiencing it,"" said peg streep, who writes about psychology and millennials. ""what should be an experience of learning and growth instead just says, 'look at me.' it's a narcissistic moment that's really about getting likes."" streep pointed to a study by linda henkel of fairfield university in connecticut that found museum visitors remember more about what they've seen if they don't take photos of the objects they're viewing. that suggests that any type of picture-taking can take ""you out of the moment of the experience and shifts your attention."" another concern is practical. a real-time selfie from a far-off place tells the world you're not home. leora halpern lanz, of long island, n.y., loves it when her three kids take vacation selfies because it's their way ""of validating where they were."" but they're not allowed to post images until the trip is over: ""i don't need their friends or friends of friends knowing the house is empty."" lanz says the widely criticized auschwitz selfie also shows ""the risks of kids posting on social media"" when they don't know what's appropriate. breanna mitchell, the young woman who took the smiling auschwitz selfie, received death threats and messages urging her to kill herself after the image went viral. in a video interview with takepart live, mitchell said the selfie was misinterpreted. she'd studied world war ii history with her father and they'd planned to visit historic sites together, but he died before they could make the trip. her selfie from the grounds of the concentration camp was her way of saying, ""i finally made it here. i finally got where me and my daddy had always said we were going to go,"" she told takepart live. looking back now on the selfie, she says, ""i just went so wrong with that."" still, most travel selfies are innocent and purely celebratory — as well as being a way for teens to keep in touch with peers. taylor garcia, 17, who traveled to texas this summer on a family road trip from oklahoma, says selfies are a fun way to remember places like disney, seaworld, and the caribbean, but she also takes them ""because i want to show my friends what i'm doing."" her mom, melissa, who posts her own family trip photos on her blog, consumerqueen.com, encourages the selfies. ""it's a great way to preserve memories,"" she said, adding that other families have contacted her after seeing the photos to get advice for their trips. austin's daughter abigail, 18, who shared selfies from a trip to portugal, doesn't see the point of posting travel pictures without familiar faces in them. she wants a photo that shows, ""hey, i'm having fun! and i like seeing them of other people, too."" but at least one tour company, tauck, has a written policy discouraging digital devices. for tauck's bridges program, which specializes in multi-generational family trips, guests are asked to ""turn off and stow their smartphones, tablets, and other portable electronic devices during shared group time."" tauck spokesman tom armstrong says the company understands that digital devices can help teens pass the time during long car rides, flights, or other downtime, ""and we have no issue with that."" but ""when the tour director is giving commentary, or during museum visits, we think that our younger guests will actually get much more out of their trip if they're engaged in the experience and not distracted."" the bottom line, says whitt: ""like all new emerging technology, the devices can be fun and wholesome, entertainment for all ages, or misused.""",['ENGLISH'],879,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-0064f210-1908-11e4-bcd8-ea5204a1de7b,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '02', 'month': '08', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000022', 'className': 'ADOLESCENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DFHJ', 'className': 'PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000971C', 'className': 'PARENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000782', 'className': 'GENERATION Y'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX002022', 'className': 'PHOTOGRAPHY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAA', 'className': 'VISUAL ARTISTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009RE0'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001916', 'className': 'TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY & TOURISM'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DFHJ', 'className': 'PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Museums'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAA', 'className': 'VISUAL ARTISTS'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'GS122', 'className': 'CONNECTICUT, USA'}]}"
,METRO/REGION;,,SOUTHBRIDGE SCHOOLS FACE DIFFICULT TEST,,"By Peter Schworm, Globe Staff ","southbridge students' mcas scores are among the worst in the state. the district has so little money, there are not enough textbooks to go around. school leaders are called ineffectual. the high school gets so cold in the winter that students wear coats.    by all accounts, southbridge is a deeply dysfunctional school district, and this fall, the state board of education cuffed it with an ""underperforming"" label, the third time it had done so.","      like two of the three boilers in the dilapidated high school, the school system is broken, many here say.    ""it would make a good comedy, if it weren't so serious,"" said steven brady, who has four children in local schools. ""all the problems are from incompetence, incompetence that runs throughout the district. it's like a virus.""    but if the turmoil has left many parents and students bitter and disillusioned, southbridge, a working-class central massachusetts town of 16,500, represents a crucible for the state's educational accountability system. can heightened scrutiny lift a district out of the doldrums, or will the stigma of failure weaken morale and deter good teachers and involved parents from moving to town?    ""it will be a test all the way around,"" said scott lazo, a school committee member who rejoined the board in june after a three-year absence.    the chaos at the start of school a year ago crystallized the system's broad failings for many local critics: when students returned to class, an ill-conceived bus plan designed to cut costs suffered a total breakdown. many children wound up at the wrong school. some barely got home before dinner. the widespread confusion forced school officials to cancel classes for several days.    ""everything they touch turns sour,"" lazo said. ""instead of saving $100,000, it wound up costing us $10,000 to foul up the bus routes.""    in september, the state added southbridge to its list of ""underperforming"" public school districts, a tally that includes two other districts, holyoke and winchendon. the designation followed a scathing state report chronicling the district's shortcomings, and it marks the first step toward state takeover if dismal mcas scores do not improve. in 2003, just 29 percent of southbridge students achieved proficiency on the state's standardized tests, one of the state's worst showings. this year, half of the eighth-graders failed the math portion of the mcas, compared with 29 percent statewide.    the state will work with the district to determine why students are not learning more and how to improve the situation.    the decision by the state board of education capped a tumultuous 12 months for southbridge's five schools. the high school had to be closed for several days because of mold, and the finances of the perennially cash-strapped district unraveled as officials discovered a $2 million deficit. three school committee members left the board, which in the spring voted to let longtime superintendent joann austin's contract expire this june.    sheila engle, who helped evaluate southbridge for the state office of educational quality and accountability, which monitors districts' performance, said the schools suffered from systemic mismanagement and a general acceptance of the status quo.    ""we didn't see a sense of urgency,"" she said.    school officials said the criticism stung, but they believe the ""underperforming"" designation is helping the district clear the slate and chart a new course. the censure, they say, was a wake-up call.    ""it's going to light a fire under the town,"" said richard f. couture, vice chairman of the school committee. ""it's going to show everyone the status quo's not cutting it.""    ""we're headed in the right direction,"" said school committee chairwoman mary ellen prencipe.    there is some cause for optimism. the percentage of sophomores who passed the mcas last spring rose sharply from the year before, and virtually all high school students are eventually passing mcas. administrators plan to hire a curriculum coordinator, and a new junior high parents group has formed.    george ladd, a professor at boston college's lynch school of education who is helping the district pinpoint where students need help, said state involvement has renewed teachers' motivation and energies.    ""they aren't coming up with excuses or questioning why this has happened,"" he said. ""they are saying, 'we're going to make this happen.' ""    people in the school community differ on how southbridge's schools fell upon such hard times. some educators cite the town's demographics, saying that the large numbers of non-native english speakers have contributed to the low mcas scores. roughly 33 percent of southbridge students are non-native english speakers; most hail from puerto rico. about 10 percent of town residents have a college degree. more than half of students receive free and reduced-price lunch. one in five students do not attend southbridge schools the entire year.    ""we're not going to be brookline,"" said martena shea, a middle-school librarian and president of the local teachers' union, adding that teachers are doing their best and that the failings are overstated. ""all our students are not going to be above average.""    austin said educators must accept responsibility for the district's shortcomings. teachers, she said, must demand more from students who are not meeting their potential.    ""you don't blame the students for a lack of performance. they don't teach themselves,"" she said. ""in too many cases, the goal is just passing. expectations have been too low.""    austin refused a reporter's request to visit the schools, saying the district needed to focus on improving.    christine salvinolo is happy with her son's third-grade teachers, but she does not plan to let him attend the junior high because of reports of discipline problems.    ""we'll probably move,"" she said. ""elementary's fine here, but the middle school's too much trouble.""    others pin the district's troubles on funding. the system's budget has increased only marginally over the last several years, leading to a steady erosion of services, school officials say. teachers have to share classrooms because of crowding, computers are too slow to run the internet or mcas tutoring software, and money has not been spent on textbooks for years.    brady was aghast to learn that his sixth-grader could not take his science textbook home because his teacher needed it for other classes.    ""that irked me,"" he said. ""how can you run a school and not give them the means to succeed?"" prencipe said residents have not shown a willingness to spend money on the schools.    ""i don't believe education is a priority in this town,"" she said.    the high school is particularly rundown. students say the air quality is poor, roofing nails hang from the ceiling, and the library's foundation is collapsing. ""it's deplorable,"" prencipe said.    interviews with some 25 students and parents echoed such sentiments.    at the high school, students also said truancy, a lack of discipline, and drug use are persistent. they said many teachers are indifferent, and students smoke in the hall, skip classes, and leave school without punishment.    at 8 percent, the high school's dropout rate far exceeds the state average of 3 percent. sidebar:troubling figuresplease refer to microfilm for chart data.     peter schworm can be reached at schworm@globe.com ",['ENGLISH'],1282,Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '11', 'day': '15', 'year': '2004'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzJCRkJGNjA2MTc4NDBGOThEMjE0M0Q4QzRDM0VCMUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'Elementary & Secondary School Boards'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CG', 'className': 'EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjdEMzYyN0Y2MjFFNEM2RkJFODk3Nzg3MjlBRTg2NjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'School Districts'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009OZR', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000006', 'className': 'ACADEMIC TESTING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkExMjY0RTgyMzAxNDZFNkE3MERFRTBGRUFDNDFFNkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI', 'className': 'Standard Achievement Tests'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000971C', 'className': 'PARENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001713', 'className': 'TEXTBOOKS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Administration & Operation'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001691', 'className': 'TEACHING & TEACHERS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001175', 'className': 'MOTORCOACHES & BUSES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N485410MM', 'className': 'SCHOOL & EMPLOYEE BUS SERVICES'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. 13,,Politicos barb and weave;,,,"timing is everything in comedy, and gov. weld and senate president william m. bulger showed yesterday that they may have a future if politics ever fails them. during bulger's annual st. patrick's day breakfast at the bayside club in south boston, bulger and weld served as each other's straight man, teasing one another over their ancestry, the senator's humble irish beginnings and the governor's wealthy wasp background. bulger and weld were joined on stage by ex-state treasurer robert q. crane and a former speaker of the massachusetts house, thomas mcgee - ""giants of the past,"" bulger called them. but most of the three-hour program featured weld and bulger trading barbs. bulger opened his introduction of weld saying, ""i didn't know protestants got up this early on sunday morning,"" and didn't stop until the last irish song was sung.","bulger said that weld had told him, ""be sure when you introduce me that you get in my law enforcement background."" the senate president obliged: ""it was only last week when he made a citizen's arrest. he pinched a handicapped person for parking in a regular parking spot."" they had the crowd roaring at their self-deprecating humor. when weld asked for the microphone, bulger said, ""you can have that. you can have anything you want. you've got everything anyway. you inherited it. my family has to win the lottery."" bulger and others repeatedly made reference to his younger brother, james (whitey) bulger, a reputed south boston gangster, and to a lottery win by one of his associates last year. the man split the winnings with whitey bulger and others. the annual breakfast is the only time that bulger truly opens up to the media, although he could not resist bashing the globe, the newspaper he loves to hate. the senate president brandished a blowup of a mock globe front page that showed a picture of weld with a large headline, ""vote for bill weld. he's better than you."" but bulger played to the cameras, brought by morley safer, a reporter with cbs' ""60 minutes."" bulger was chiding himself for being lured by the bright lights, allowing a story to be done on him by the prestigious news show, and worrying about how he would be portrayed when crane quipped, ""you'll wish it was 60 seconds."" later, bulger came back to safer: ""60 minutes. tick. tick. tick. like a time bomb."" the most bizarre part of the program was a telephone call from vice president dan quayle as he cruised in air force two ""somewhere over the west."" bulger asked quayle, ""can you see out the window? can you see jerry brown?"" quayle said, ""he's up here. he's very close to us."" weld's funniest moment came when he sang a song he wrote to the tune of ""hello, patsy fagen,"" calling his version ""hello, billy bulger."" when weld instructed the band to play the song in the key of c, bulger was beside himself. ""in c,"" he said, his voice rising in pitch. weld's song went like this, in part: hello, billy bulger, you're the king of old south boston, but a duke on beacon hill. did i forget to mention i just saw mayor flynn? he just ran in from hopkinton but looked so pale and thin. i hate to mention this to you, but someone should tell ray, the marathon is run next month and not st. patrick's day. remember last year, billy, when your brother won the dough? he said he had to split it up with so-and-so. but things could have been so much worse in splitting up his game. if he made the score the year before, he'd have had to split with crane. weld also took a jab in his song at bulger's loyalty to francis joyce, executive director of the hynes convention center and a former bulger aide, and conflicts that joyce has had with the current state treasurer, joseph malone. i speak of your friend franny joyce and his castle called the hynes. if malone decides to privatize, franny still will win. i have some clout. he won't be out. he'll run the pine street inn. weld held up pictures of himself shooting a gun and a group of men who appeared to be firing back to illustrate what he says was his first ""secret"" meeting with bulger. weld also displayed a picture of two paper boys, one of whom he represented as bulger, to explain what he said is the genesis of bulger's hatred for the globe and the reason for bulger's purported proposal to place a plutonium dump at 135 morrissey blvd. a wealthy beacon hill resident had gotten bulger fired, weld said, because, as a 7-year-old, bulger had missed a delivery. bulger, displaying a photo of weld in full hunting attire, poked fun at the avid hunter while the governor was demonstrating how a turkey call worked. ""did you blast any birds on the way over? the audubon society calls him the terminator,"" bulger said. the only non-irish song sung yesterday was by sen. bill owens of boston, apparently alluding to his own brother's 1990 drug arrest. ""you have to understand the origin of the song,"" owens said. ""some people say bulger and owens got more in common than you'll ever know. i got a brother who's been caught by the law, and he's got one that's been running from the law."" with that, owens had the nearly all-white crowd in a soulful sway, clapping hands and singing, ""i'm in jail, a-doin' hard time."" when the song ended, bulger said, ""i have no idea what county that song comes from."" he corrected himself quickly. ""county roxbury. that's where it comes from.""",['ENGLISH'],901,Copyright 1992 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '03', 'day': '16', 'year': '1992'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9C', 'className': 'GOVERNORS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERN', 'className': 'TREASURY DEPARTMENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '69', 'classCode': 'N713290MM', 'className': 'LOTTERIES'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY', 'className': 'Parking Facilities'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000D0L8', 'className': 'TELEVISION NEWS SHOWS'}], 'person': [{'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE000CRF5', 'className': 'JERRY BROWN'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Obits,"Jack Renner, cofounder of Telarc, at 84",,,"new york — jack renner, who with robert woods founded telarc, a record label whose carefully engineered recordings were prized by audiophiles and won dozens of grammy awards — 11 of them for him personally — died on june 19 at his home in portsmouth, r.i. he was 84. his daughter, elizabeth click, said the cause was cancer.","body in the early 1960s, mr. renner was a high school music teacher in cleveland looking for a way out of teaching when he began to turn a hobby, recording things, into a business. ""there were a number of pressing plants around the country advertising in music magazines: 'send us your tape and we'll make it a record,' "" he told stereophile magazine in 1998. ""i found one that was doing franchising — they set you up with professional gear and taught you the basics. my business was dealing mostly with high schools, churches, colleges, community choruses, bands, for — i hate the term — 'souvenir records.' "" he soon met and teamed up with woods, a vocal soloist who sang at cleveland churches. woods's contacts with musicians in the cleveland orchestra expanded the business, with various players in the orchestra making vanity records. ""it gave us an opportunity to record some very fine musicians,"" mr. renner recalled in that interview. the two formed telarc in cleveland in 1977, starting off with a certain audacity: recording lorin maazel and the cleveland orchestra, they employed the rarely used direct-to-disc method, which captured the sound directly onto a disc rather than tape and was thought to offer superior audio quality. the album was called ""direct from cleveland."" ""it met with mixed success,"" mr. renner said in a 2011 interview with the audio engineering society. ""there were too many fingers in the pie."" but, he added, ""it put us on the map."" telarc soon began working in the emerging field of digital recording. in 1978, the company made what mr. renner said was the first commercially released digital recording of symphonic music in the united states, featuring frederick fennell and the cleveland symphonic winds. ""it created a lot of stir among audiophiles,"" he said. ""it had a bass drum that blew up speakers. everybody accused us of hyping the bass drum. we didn't."" mr. renner was telarc's chief engineer, tackling the difficult task of how to record ensembles in a way that would capture the truest sound. others were soon trying to copy his microphone placement practices. ""when i first started making orchestral recordings with three and four microphones, i had a lot of imitators,"" mr. renner told stereophile. ""but people just didn't quite get it right. because it's not just putting up three or four mikes. it's which mikes you choose, it's the cable, it's the electronics — it's the whole signal path."" he won the first of his grammys in 1985, for best engineered classical recording, for an atlanta symphony orchestra recording of berlioz. but, with his projects scrutinized by audiophiles with exacting standards and varying tastes, he was always conscious that perfection was in the ear of the listener.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Wolf vows to stay in governor's race,Democrat defies ethics panel ruling,,"democratic gubernatorial candidate dan wolf said wednesday that he will continue campaigning and remain a state senator as he works to overturn an ethics ruling that claims his holdings in cape air bar him from holding public office. the state ethics commission found that wolf's 23 percent ownership of the company, which has two contracts with the massachusetts port authority to operate out of ­logan airport, puts him in conflict with state ethics law. that statute prohibits state officials from having an interest in state contracts. ""i disagree with this opinion and will be working to rectify what i ­believe to be an unfortunate conclusion based on a flawed process,"" wolf said in a statement he released wednesday along with the commission's ruling.","the commission also gave wolf, a harwich democrat who was elected to the state senate in 2010, 30 days to make a decision to either ­resign his legislative post or divest his interest in cape air. the senator, who had asked the commission to review his ties to cape air, a company he created 25 years ago, did not say in his statement whether he would ­resign his senate seat. but a source knowledgeable with his decision said he will not give up the legislative position while he battles the ruling. the commission concluded that cape air's contracts with massport, which allows the airline to operate out of logan airport, ""raises substantial issues"" under the conflict-of-interest law. massport is a quasi-public agency whose board is controlled by the governor. ""consequently, to comply with the law, he must do one of the following: terminate the cape air contracts with massport; entirely and permanently divest his holdings in cape air; or resign his current public ­office and discontinue his campaign for governor,"" the commission said in its ruling, which was delivered to wolf last friday. wolf said that the ruling is an overly strict interpretation of state ethics statutes. ""this opinion . . . would prevent any successful businessperson who may have even tangential business interaction with the state from entering public life,"" wolf said. wolf, who declined to be inter­viewed for this report, did not say in his statement whether he would appeal to the ethics commission to reconsider or go directly to the state courts. while the ruling noted that he had 30 days to bring himself into compliance with the conflict-­of-interest law, those familiar with the ethics commission's activities say that it would not take any action against him during a court ­appeal. the two massport contracts with cape air were signed in 2002. according to wolf, they ""automatically renew month to month and year to year respectively."" he said no action has been taken on them since then and that cape air fees are set by massport in accordance with federal regulations. they are not negotiated and apply to all airlines. wolf, who is a dark horse candidate to succeed governor deval patrick, is hoping to use his business background to promote his candidacy for the democratic gubernatorial nomination. but the ethics ruling creates a major hurdle for his candidacy, as he tries to raise funds and recruit volunteers and staff. the uncertainty will make it difficult for him to persuade ­donors and supporters to rally behind a candidacy that could possibly end in the next months. wolf said he had contacted the commission last spring when he was thinking of running for governor in order to clarify any potential ethical conflicts between his duties as governor and his ownership of cape air. ""an initial conversation with state ethics commission staff led me to believe that no such conflict would exist, reiterating an informal opinion regarding the state senate before i was first elected in 2010,"" wolf said in his statement. he also noted that his previous filings to the ethics commission made clear his holdings and relationship to cape air and that the issue of a poten­tial conflict was never ""flagged as an area of concern."" wolf's problems with the ethics commission could well have raised the ethics bar to a new level for public officials who have significant interest in firms that do any business with state agencies. senate president therese murray came to wolf's defense within hours after the issue ­became public wednesday. ""the recent ruling by the state ethics commission seems like a harsh result, and i support dan wolf in his efforts to rescind this decision,"" murray said. common cause of massachusetts, an ethics watchdog group, said the issues raised by the commission are not entirely clear. tyler creighton, its executive director, said the question may hinge on the discretion that massport has in negotiating a contract over airport fees. ""there is an argument to be made by senator wolf as to whether cape air's contract is covered by the statute,"" said creighton. ""but if massport has discretion, the senator has a harder argument to make."" massport spokesman matt brelis said wolf's statement that the cape air contracts are not negotiated with the agency ""are accurate."" ""the rates for massport lease agreements are set by massport; they are not negotiated with airlines,"" he said. ""the rate is the same for each airline operating in a given terminal."" frank phillips can be reached at phillips@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],879,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-7f51af9a-ff92-11e2-94d3-c86d07d1d1c9,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '08', 'month': '08', 'year': '2013'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Public Contracts Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA5QTlFMDVCQUY0NEY0NUE1QzMyQzA1QkQyQzJGRUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000654', 'className': 'ETHICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9C', 'className': 'GOVERNORS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001342', 'className': 'POLITICAL CANDIDATES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000517', 'className': 'DIVESTITURES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001425', 'className': 'PUBLIC CONTRACTING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001929', 'className': 'COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008X0L', 'className': 'PORT AUTHORITIES'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"

""we are still at our infancy and this is a great leap forward to benefit public health."" kevin tuohey, bu medical center executive director of operations and public safety, said the proposed security plans for the nine-story building would include a complex system of id cards, retinal scans, and outside access control using biometrics that would focus more on ""identification of people, not their pin numbers."" he called the areas where infectious disease research would be conducted as ""submarines within a vault"" and said that particles would be sterilized after research is finished. officials assured the panel of city councilors, led by councilor jerry mcdermott, that the center is not a bioweapons facility and that research projects would not be classified. groups opposing the lab, including safety net and alternatives for community and environment, say that the partial funding from the us department of homeland security and the national institutes for health could take away exclusive research control from bu and allow private projects. councilor paul j. scapicchio expressed concern over the transportation of infectious disease samples delivered to the proposed lab, which tuohey said would occur roughly three times a month. though no delivery plan has been established, it is possible that the organisms could be sent via a package company such as federal express or ups. however, they would be sent in tested, triple- layered packaging by ""white-glove"" drivers trained and screened by federal authorities, tuohey said. councilor at large maura a. hennigan questioned how medical center officials could monitor the south end and surrounding areas for health problems if an infectious disease managed to slip out. and councilor at large felix d. arroyo grilled lab proponents on safety details and the likelihood of a disease transmission. arroyo, hennigan, and councilors chuck turner and charles c. yancey have voiced opposition to the project. patricia hynes, a professor at bu's school of public health, called the center an ""environmental injustice"" for the close proximity of an ""undesirable and controversial public institution"" near low-income neighborhoods, which she deemed ""sacrifice zones . . . for regional benefit."" but dr. mark s. klemper, bu medical center's associate provost for research, said the lab would help with the worldwide effort to fight the infectious diseases that ravage third world countries and the developed world. ""this is a facility that will lead an effort to develop understanding and better diagnostics against infectious diseases,"" he said.

""we hardly see each other anyway. we'll probably see each other more. we'll talk. we'll text. it will all be fine."" and maybe it will be. but it doesn't feel fine today. it feels like loss. it feels like the empty space a carnival leaves behind when it packs up and leaves town. it feels like what it is: a thousand-mile gulf. we'll get used to it. but right now, today, i miss my friend. beverly beckham lives in canton. she can be reached at beverlybeckham@me.com",['ENGLISH'],603,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-cc3288f6-d86a-11e2-96d2-48f99a3cc5bf,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '23', 'month': '06', 'year': '2013'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DIF5', 'className': 'ADULTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001830', 'className': 'WEDDINGS & ENGAGEMENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009Y72', 'className': 'CHRISTMAS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001553', 'className': 'SEWING & NEEDLECRAFTS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000A2WF', 'className': 'ICE SKATING'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST000D9GY', 'className': 'SPORTS INSTRUCTION'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST000CFLA', 'className': 'RACQUETBALL'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'STX000208', 'className': 'BREAST CANCER'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'STX001707', 'className': 'TENNIS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX002042', 'className': 'CHEMOTHERAPY & RADIATION'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001071', 'className': 'MARATHONS'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}], 'city': [{'score': '50', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. 27 p,,HARD TIMES FOR STATE HOUSE INSIDERS;,,,"republicans were poised last night to make their largest single-election gain in the massachusetts house in at least 50 years, but democrats went to sleep knowing they retained solid control of the chamber. at least seven democratic incumbents lost reelection bids, and republicans also appeared to have won four open seats that had been controlled by democrats. gop gains were diminished by the loss of two open seats formerly held by republicans, but the minority party seemed likely to gain at least eight seats in the 160-member house. the modern gop record for a single election had been a six-seat increase in 1962, when the house still had 240 members.","the democratic incumbents who were defeated included reps. augusto grace (d-burlington), robert bohigian (d-worcester) robert emmet hayes (d-whitman), chester suhoski (d-gardner), frances alexander (d-beverly), patricia fiero (d-glocester) and susan tucker (d-andover). several other democratic incumbents also were in danger of losing their seats. ""we're losing some we didn't want to lose, but we're going to win some we didn't expect to win, so overall the numbers won't change drastically,"" said democratic consultant charles baker, who follows legislative races for the state party. democrats entered the election with a 128-31 advantage over republicans in the house, with one seat open. grace was beaten by marianne brenton, a former burlington school committee member, who labeled him a tax-and-spend liberal and called him a liar when he said he helped develop proposals that cut $ 300 million from the state budget. both grace and brenton attributed the outcome to an anti-incumbent sentiment. ""it's the negative feelings about the state's fiscal situation. people didn't want to talk about an individual legislator's accomplishments,"" grace said. hayes lost to michael j. sullivan of abington, who ran an aggressive campaign associating hayes with gov. dukakis, outgoing house speaker george keverian and other unpopular democrats. ""he linked me to them all. plus, there was a larger anti-incumbent wave than we expected, and that did me in,"" said hayes, a four-term representative. tucker, who had been expected to become chairwoman of the house education committee if reelected, was defeated by gary m. coon, the owner of a water treatment firm. coon disagreed with tucker's staunch support of abortion rights and her opposition to the question 3 tax rollback. suhoski, a four-term representative, lost to robert d. hawke of gardner in an upset that surprised officials of both parties. neither had considered suhoski to be in danger of losing. bohigian's loss to republican david lionett, a former state representative, had been expected. bohigian, a 32-year incumbent, spent most of the campaign on the defensive against lionett's attacks on his effectiveness and independence. lionett also benefited from a $ 70,000 campaign fund, the largest of any challenger in the state. alexander lost to james r. henry, a beverly bookkeeper whose candidacy seemed to lose steam when it was revealed that he had made several false statements on his resume about his educational and professional experience. he appeared to recover in the final days as he continued to attack alexander for voting in favor of tax increases and failing to represent the city's interests. fiero lost to bruce tarr, a recent graduate of suffolk university law school, who branded her a free-taxing liberal with strong ties to keverian. republicans also gained a democrat's seat when douglas stoddart defeated democrat susan salamoff in natick and sherborn. salamoff became the democratic nominee by defeating rep. joseph connolly (d-natick) in the september primary. stoddart was one of the few republican candidates to oppose question 3, while salamoff came under fire for suggesting changes in proposition 2 1/2 might be warranted. republican candidates won seats formerly held by democratic reps. marilyn travinski of southbridge, sherwood guernsey of williamstown and geoffrey beckwith of reading. democrats countered by winning the two seats vacated by republican reps. peter torkildsen of danvers and richard tisei of wakefield. one incumbent who defied all odds was rep. barbara gray of framingham, who was defeated in the republican primary but came back to win as a democrat last night, having won enough write-in votes in the primary to appear as the democratic nominee. dozens of state representatives had been bracing themselves last night, wondering whether the public's appetite for ousting legislators was sated or merely whetted by the september primary defeats of nine house incumbents. at the outset, the candidates with the most to fear were the democrats, who have ruled the house with a progressively tightening grip since 1955. seventy-one democratic state representatives were facing reelection challenges, many for the first time, compared with only nine republicans. republicans fielded candidates in 120 of the 160 house districts, the most in recent years, but many were considered long shots. alexander tennant, executive director of the state republican party, said he considered gop candidates ""competitive in at least 60 house races. our potential is unlimited."" but in the next breath, he said that a gain of 12 seats would be ""incredible."" in the past 50 years, the largest increase in seats held by republicans in a single election was the six in 1962. two years later, however, the gop lost 21 seats. the modern democratic record was a 26-seat gain in 1948. while a 12-seat gop increase would be significant, it would leave republicans short of the magic number of 54, enough house members to sustain a gubernatorial veto. during a televised interview sunday night, gubernatorial nominee william weld mentioned a veto-proof legislature as one element that would help him govern. while most analysts said republicans were positioned to make some inroads, baker said he believes the house will remain firmly in control of the democrats. ""it's totally unlikely the balance is going to change in the house,"" baker said. ""there are going to be new faces: fresh, invigorated people; but a lot of them will be democrats."" most of the fresh faces will be the winners of 33 house seats left open by the voluntary or primary-prompted retirement of incumbents. twenty-seven of those seats were most recently held by democrats, and analysts predicted that most will remain off-limits to republicans. democrats also had an advantage before the first vote was counted: 32 democratic incumbents and one democratic newcomer were running unopposed, compared with 16 incumbent republicans. statewide, going into the election, the democratic incumbents who appeared to be at greatest risk were liberal women, many of whom were identified with support for higher taxes and with social programs criticized as unduly expensive by their republican opponents. ""women across the board have been the most hard-pressed candidates this year, but the irony is women have been among the most responsible legislators we have, casting gutsy votes they know might hurt them politically,"" said rep. charles flaherty (d-cambridge), the heir apparent to become house speaker.",['ENGLISH'],1211,Copyright 1990 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '11', 'day': '07', 'year': '1990'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CYCH', 'className': 'LIBERALISM'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX000002', 'className': 'ABORTION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00097CW', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT BUDGETS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000218', 'className': 'BUDGETS'}], 'person': [{'score': '74', 'classCode': 'PE000DHHB', 'className': 'CHARLIE BAKER'}], 'city': [{'score': '58', 'classCode': 'ST000D274', 'className': 'WORCESTER, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. 31,,Silber says gays force lifestyle issue,,,"boston university president john silber, a potential candidate for governor in 1994, is striving to explain comments he made at a new york university forum two weeks ago, where he reportedly said he was sick of ""so-called gay people trying to force their sexual lifestyles down everybody's throats."" the forum, titled ""anatomy of hate"" and sponsored by the elie wiesel foundation for humanity, was a two-day conference that began nov. 15 at nyu. silber was on a panel discussing how children learn hatred, when a gay activist stood up and protested the lack of an openly gay person on the panel who could address hate crimes against gay people and homophobia. silber responded to the activist, new york lawyer william dobbs, by suggesting that a discussion of gay issues was inappropriate. although no record of the exchange is readily available, gabriel rotello, a free-lance reporter for new york newsday, asked silber what he had said in a telephone interview nov. 25 that rotello said he recorded.","according to rotello, who published an article on the subject in wednesday's new york newsday, silber recalled that he responded to dobbs by saying that ""most of us consider sexuality a private concern,"" and that he was sick of ""so-called gay people trying to force their sexual lifestyles down everybody's throats, insisting on turning every meeting into a testimonial on sexual preference."" silber said in the interview with rotello that homosexuality ""had no place in a discussion concerning children, for whom homosexual orientation is not an issue . . . decent parents don't even discuss the possibility that there are homosexuals."" the controversial bu president, who was well known for making statements dubbed ""silber shockers"" in his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 1990, added that there was no place for gays in a multicultural curriculum, because ""gayness is not a culture."" ""if you make it a culture you've got to have a culture of hamburger eaters and pastrami eaters, too,"" silber said, according to rotello's transcipt of the conversation. silber declined to talk to the globe. but in a letter that silber wrote to wiesel, a bu professor, silber does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes attributed to him by rotello. instead, he disputes rotello's description of how dobbs interrupted the forum and how silber allegedly ""exploded"" in response. ""dobbs burst into the discussion with a tirade denouncing the conference because of the absence of any gay person on the panel,"" silber wrote to wiesel. ""and my response, far from an explosion, was a calm examination of the issues."" ""i pointed out that dobbs could not possibly know how many 'straight' or 'gay' people were among the panelists because only he had declared himself with regard to his sexual preference. i pointed out that he did not know mine and i did not know the sexual preference of the other people in the room,"" silber wrote. ""i made it clear that i refused to be intimidated by his dobbs' hatred for people who do not endorse his lifestyle,"" silber wrote in the letter, dated dec. 3, which was provided by bu. dobbs could not be reached for comment yesterday. in the letter, silber goes on to defend his record on gay issues in his 22 years at boston university, saying he has ""consistently upheld their legal and constitutional rights"" and employed many ""homosexuals at all levels."" ""the point at which homosexuals and i part company is when they try to make public proclamation of our sexual orientation and demand that everyone endorse their lifestyle as normative,"" silber wrote. ""no one is under any obligation to endorse the homosexual lifestyle although all of us have an obligation to respect the rights of individuals who are homosexual,"" he wrote. ""we should refuse to be intimidated by bullying homosexual activists when they intrude on meetings and try to disrupt them. ""it is time we publicly refuse to endorse this way of living as normative."" ""every society, religious institution, and parent has a perfect right to encourage heterosexuality as that mode of sexual expression most conducive to strong families and to happy and fulfilled individual lives,"" silber concludes in the letter. the nov. 15 forum was reportedly videotaped, but the foundation did not respond to a globe request for a copy of the tape. a spokesman for new york university said the forum was not an nyu event and the school had no tape of the proceedings. rotello said, however, that he was confident silber repeated the essence of what he said at the nov. 15 forum in his telephone interview nov. 25.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",WEST,,Offender plan draws questions,,Megan Woolhouse Globe Staff,"globe west 1 / region representative karyn polito has been at the forefront of a statewide effort to enact tougher laws for sex offenders, but the shrewsbury republican this week criticized one aspect of a proposed marlborough sex-offender ordinance as going too far.  the marlborough proposal, recently amended by mayor nancy e. stevens, would ban convicted sex offenders from public places like the solomon pond mall, the assabet river rail trail, and marlborough country club.","""on paper it might sound good,"" polito said in an interview. ""practically, it might be difficult for police to enforce and in that respect it may go too far."" polito plans to hold a public forum on sex offender legislation tonight at 7 at westborough high school. police chiefs from westborough and shrewsbury will speak, as will a representative from the state's sex offender registry board. polito proposed several initiatives pertaining to sex offenders last year that have become law, including requiring sex offenders to wear global positioning system tracking devices. her efforts to enact tougher minimum sentences for sex offenders and the creation of a statewide regulation that would bar sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school or place where children congregate failed to emerge from a subcommittee. she has resubmitted her plan to the legislature this year. marlborough, like fitchburg, west boylston, and several other communities across the state, has drafted ordinances that would ban sex offenders from living near schools and day-care centers. last fall, stevens vetoed an ordinance at the last minute, expressing concerns about its constitutionality. it would have banned sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of day-care centers, schools, and places where children congregate - effectively covering 98 percent of the city. stevens met with marlborough officials, including the police chief and the city's legal counsel, to create a new version of the proposal. unveiled last month, it is in some respects more restrictive than the original. the revised bylaw would ban sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of schools, day-care centers and places where children congregate, but widens the proposal to include homes for the mentally retarded and group residences for anyone over age 60. the new restrictions would put roughly 84 percent of the city off limits. sex offenders now living in the city would be permitted to remain in their current residences. the new plan also would ban sex offenders from visiting and working at a long list of locations, such as the mall, a city bike trail, and some restaurants. the mayor's office would be in charge of selecting which locations would be covered by the ordinance. speaking about her decision last week, stevens said she wanted to find a way to protect vulnerable people in the city, yet avoid a lawsuit. the massachusetts chapter of the american civil liberties union has raised objections to sex offender legislation. in defending her plan, stevens said, ""the mall on a friday and saturday night ... is packed with teenagers. parents drop them off, and anybody that's looking for an opportunity, well, that's an opportunity."" marlborough police chief mark leonard, whose officers would be responsible for enforcing the measure, said the plan gives officers more tools to work with if they get a call about a suspicious person at a public place. but he acknowledged that officers wouldn't know whether someone is a sex offender, and also have no way of knowing who is a sex offender unless someone reports a problem. ""we can't check everybody who goes to the mall or sports center,"" he said recently. as of tuesday, 41 level 2 offenders and 11 level 3 offenders were registered in marlborough, according to the state registry's website, sorb.chs.state.ma.us. the marlborough city council held a public meeting on the proposed ordinance monday night, but only a handful of people spoke on the issue. opponents slightly outnumbered supporters. the city council will not vote on the matter for several weeks. on monday, they sent the proposal back to the city's legal counsel for review. four of the 11 sitting councilors have already expressed opposition to the plan. steven levy, the ordinance's original author and most ardent supporter, continues to defend it. he said he likes the mayor's plan, and was surprised to find that her changes increased its reach. he said he hoped that legal considerations would not further delay its passage. ""we need to get something on the books,"" he said. megan woolhouse can be reached at mwoolhouse@globe.com.",['ENGLISH'],767,Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5807851,,,FIRST EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '29', 'month': '03', 'year': '2007'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Civil Rights Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1MzRDRUY1OTZBNDRDNTlDODQzRDRCMUFCNDc2RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q', 'className': 'Ordinances & Regulations'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Constitutional Law'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjE4RjM0QzQ3OTFBNDBGREE5RjAyODJGRDhBMjA4MkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ3NDdBNUU0RDM2NDJENTgzOTZFRjM0QzIzMjg1MjA', 'className': 'Vetoes'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q', 'className': 'Mayors'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0008X91', 'className': 'SCHOOL SAFETY & SECURITY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N813311MM', 'className': 'HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUIzQ0NGRDZERUU3NERCODg2MEZFMDI2RTI0RTA3RTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Sentencing'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001803', 'className': 'VICTIMS RIGHTS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000300', 'className': 'CITY LIFE'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001114', 'className': 'MENTAL RETARDATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '84', 'classCode': 'N623200CC', 'className': 'RESIDENTIAL CARE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001482', 'className': 'RESTAURANTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'N623210MM', 'className': 'MENTAL RETARDATION FACILITIES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000794', 'className': 'GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",G,Living Arts,An operatic interpretation of Isabella Stewart Gardner's life,,,"isabella stewart gardner might be the stuff of opera. it would have to be a comic opera, since she was a free spirit who terrified the back bay by building an italian-style palazzo on the fenway (now the museum that bears her name), attending boxing matches, and wearing a ``go, red sox'' headband to symphony hall. this at the turn of the last century. there is no headband in ``a place of beauty,'' or much else to suggest the scandal-loving arts patron whose legacy is now undergoing a $118 million renovation and extension. the hourlong chamber opera, by robert edward smith, with libretto by william a. fregosi and fritz bell, had its premiere performances last weekend at boston conservatory, presented in collaboration with intermezzo: the new england chamber opera series and the chamber orchestra of boston, david feltner conducting.","one has to begin with some praise. the plot is well made. it begins with isabella (barbara kilduff) coming to life in her own museum, disturbed by thieves making off with several paintings (as they did in 1990). it ends with her receding into her own portrait (a successful coup de theatre) in her new museum. in between, we witness a series of scenes from isabella's life: a young woman, arrived from new york, being snubbed by a boston matron (janna baty), marrying a harvard catch, jack gardner (paul guttry), grieving over a dead child, traveling to paris where a couturier helps revive her (she brought back low-cut dresses to shock boston), and visiting bernard berenson (ray bauwens) in italy to ask his help in gathering her notable art collection. smith's music - performed by a small cast, plus eight strings, bassoon, horn, and clarinet, under feltner - is tuneful and well made. ``a place of beauty'' is the first opera by smith, a skilled harpsichordist and a composer in residence at trinity college chapel in hartford. the work is reminiscent of the victorian dance hall and stephen foster. alas, this fabric doesn't change. in paris, one might expect a faster tempo and a hint of cafe life in the music, a touch of chabrier or chaminade. (isabella was a lively dancer, though one wouldn't know it from this opera.) nor does the music dare to change texture, and add a touch of dissonance, for moments of soulful (ideally, half crazy) confession - the kind of thing, after all, that opera does best. it tries, but there are no peaks or serious conflicts in the narrative to help, and the libretto does not specify emotions in a way that is anything but trite. ``can't?!'' isabella sings when she gets the idea of creating a collection. ``who am i to say i can't? i must, i shall!'' much of isabella's music is sad and slow, when, given the plot, it should bubble. a brief burst of coloratura (and here kilduff's fine voice, once a met fixture in lyric-coloratura roles, comes into its element) suggests what more could have been done. isabella's encounters with the boston matron are amusing (baty is haughty), but isabella doesn't get the better of her as the historical isabella so palpably did. david perkins can be reached at davidsperkins@gmail.com opera review a place of beauty composed by robert edward smith, libretto by william a. fregosi and fritz bell presented by intermezzo: the new england chamber opera series and the chamber orchestra of boston; david feltner, conductor. at: boston conservatory theater, sunday",['ENGLISH'],561,Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,GK11PCDSS.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '17', 'month': '05', 'year': '2011'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Energy & Utilities Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"

,SPORTS; Pg. 69,,Home run for Sox - Canseco;,,,"dennis gilbert, the beverly hills sports agent, might be a little prejudiced when it comes to his home run-hitting client, jose canseco. but after the red sox had acquired their most colorful player since ken (hawk) harrelson last night, gilbert told general manager dan duquette, ""congratulations on getting the guy who's gonna break roger maris' record."" we've heard these promises before regarding the likes of jack clark and andre dawson, as well as lesser entities. but the red sox pulled off what many baseball people feel is a steal by trading third baseman luis ortiz and otis nixon to the texas rangers for canseco.","the red sox avoided dealing righthanded reliever ken ryan, whom the rangers desperately wanted. with some negotiating yesterday, the sox got the rangers to address their secondary need, a third baseman. the rangers had put the deal on hold while they pursued a better possibility. they tried to send canseco to california for lefty chuck finley, but the angels refused. while duquette was being hailed for the deal in boston, rangers gm doug melvin was taking the heat in texas. why didn't he come out of it with a pitcher? ""the red sox felt they didn't have enough pitching to give ryan up,"" said melvin. the acquisition of ortiz allows texas to platoon him with dean palmer, who has led american league third basemen in errors the past two years and now can spend more time at dh. the rangers love ortiz' hitting potential and liken him to julio franco. canseco, a power hitter with 276 career homers in eight seasons and in his prime at age 30, had been rumored to be coming to boston since monday. hangups, including which player besides nixon would be included in the deal and lockout language in canseco's contract, delayed it until last night. at 5:30, duquette consummated the biggest transaction of his short boston tenure. ""jose canseco is one of the most exciting players in baseball,"" said duquette from the diamond club at fenway park. ""he and former texas and current boston manager kevin kennedy have a special relationship, and he should continue to be a productive player for kevin in the future."" the loss of nixon means the sox need a center fielder. though duquette played up the possibility of promoting backup lee tinsley, the team has the option of trading for houston's steve finley, who will earn $ 4.25 million in 1995. nixon took the trade in stride, saying from his home in suburban atlanta, ""i came to the red sox and it was exciting for me there. i was able to create excitement and give them something they'd never had. i hope to do the same thing in texas."" the red sox acquired canseco with no contract extension in the works. duquette said the team would not negotiate with canseco during the season because ""when the season starts, it's time to play baseball."" he didn't believe the sox would attempt to sign canseco long-term prior to the season, either. the sox made informal inquiries about how much it might take to re-sign him. the slugger, a former american league mvp and rookie of the year, also downplayed signing an extension. ""the most important thing right now is to get the strike settled and play baseball again,"" said canseco. ""i'm very happy to be playing in boston and with kevin again. he and i have a very special relationship."" so special that canseco convinced his texas manager he should pitch against the red sox at fenway park on may 29, 1993. the fallout from that performance is why canseco is now considered a dh rather than a decent right fielder with a good arm. canseco had ulnar nerve surgery following the outing and spent all of last season recuperating, unable to play the outfield. ""kevin . . .,"" canseco, speaking from his home in miami, asked over a speaker phone at the press conference, ""can i continue my pitching career?"" ""not in my lifetime,"" shot back kennedy. the ill-fated pitching attempt was the latest chapter in a long series of bizarre events for canseco, including a rocky marriage that ended in divorce, a series of speeding incidents, an altercation in which he and his ex-wife, esther, were trying to run each other off the road, a weapons possession charge and, of course, his infamous dating of madonna. canseco is now happily involved in a relationship and has turned his life around after admitting he nearly tried to commit suicide two years ago. he credits kennedy with helping him as a friend; that's why he would consider staying in boston as long as kennedy is the manager. and he loves the fans. ""they are very knowledgeable fans,"" said canseco. ""i definitely know boston fans appreciate a quality player who can provide some things out of the ordinary, like myself. i know every time i'd hit one over the lights in batting practice, there'd be 25,000 going berserk."" canseco said he looked forward to playing in the smallish ballpark. after all, he's hit 12 homers at fenway in 162 at-bats, one every 13.5 at-bats. ""i'm a fly-ball hitter,"" said canseco. ""that wall is only about 310 feet away, and i'm going to try to take advantage of that. the key is staying healthy. if i can stay healthy, i'm going to put up the numbers."" observers in texas say canseco was hurt by the ballpark in arlington because left field was the largest area. high flies were caught. they'll be expected to go over the wall here. canseco, never considered a leader, was asked to comment about the possibility of being one in boston. ""they have some veterans on the team and i don't know right now which one of them is a leader,"" he said. ""in my career, i've never been the type to come in and ask to be a leader. i lead by example."" kennedy said he's been toying with a lineup for some time. in texas, he had canseco hitting third in front of will clark. here he would would like to bat mo vaughn and canseco back-to-back. but there's still a missing piece to the puzzle. if the sox should acquire a right fielder, larry walker or mark whiten, one of them could alter the lineup mix. canseco doesn't know whether kennedy will want him to play in the field. he said he was prepared to after the all-star game, but the players' strike hit. canseco said he always thought the red sox lacked righthanded power. now they have it. and he must live up to the expectations of many, including his agent.",['ENGLISH'],1057,Copyright 1994 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '12', 'day': '10', 'year': '1994'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000170', 'className': 'BASEBALL'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SFT', 'className': 'SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SFT', 'className': 'SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GX591', 'className': 'HOUSTON, TX, USA'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'GX555', 'className': 'ATLANTA, GA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}]}"

""i'm going to do it as quickly as i can, subject to the constraints that i run into."" one of those constraints would be the nfl playoffs if jankovich is looking for an assistant on a super bowl contender. one of those candidates could be kansas city assistant and former san diego head coach al saunders, who was contacted by rust last spring as a potential patriots offensive coordinator. the same situation would apply to giants defensive coordinator bill belichik. but jankovich, the former university of miami athletic dierctor, would seem more inclined to look within the collegiate ranks. with recruiting season under way, jankovich will have to make a decision quickly. names on jankovich's wish list could include kentucky coach bill curry, georgia tech's bobby ross and ucla's terry donahue. curry would seem a good choice, but he just took the job at kentucky a year ago and might be reluctant to leave so quickly. ross has just won half a national championship at georgia tech and will be expensive if the patriots are really serious. the same could be said for donahue, who has strong roots in southern california and has turned down nfl offers before. green would seem to be a logical candidate. although he might not be janovich's first choice, he may turn out to be his best choice. what the patriots do not want is the type of situation that haunted boston college last month, when the eagles learned rather painfully that the interest was minimal until athletic director chet gladchuk came back to giants assistant tom coughlin.",['ENGLISH'],543,Copyright 1991 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '01', 'day': '05', 'year': '1991'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Antitrust & Trade Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CA1R', 'className': 'SCHOOL ATHLETIC STAFF'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C9YJ', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX544', 'className': 'SAN DIEGO, CA, USA'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GX609', 'className': 'KANSAS CITY, MO, USA'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GX616', 'className': 'MIAMI, FL, USA'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GX621', 'className': 'TAMPA, FL, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS129', 'className': 'ILLINOIS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}]}"
Newspapers,GLOBE NORTH;,,NUNS FACE POINT OF DEPARTURE,,"By Kathy McCabe, Globe Staff ","a simple silver cross over the front door sets apart the red-brick building at the top of harbor street from others in the point, an immigrant neighborhood on the edge of downtown salem. st. joseph convent the last in a city that once had five has been home to catholic nuns since the first convent was built 112 years ago to serve st. joseph school and church. over time, three orders of nuns lived at the convent, teaching next door at the school.     the convent today is home to four sisters of the assumption of the blessed virgin, which has staffed st. joseph school since 1925. three of them sister fernande richard, sister yvette beauregard, and sister estelle grenier are true daughters of st. joseph. they grew up in the parish and went to the school there. a fourth, sister muriel lemoine, lives at the convent, but works as the campus minister at salem state college.","""it always seemed so special here,"" beauregard, 59, said softly, seated on a chair in the living room. ""when i was a young girl, i saw that the nuns were dedicated to their faith. they were happy. they were living together."" convent life at st. joseph may soon end. the three-story convent is expected to close, along with st. joseph church, some time over the next six months. the 131-year-old, french-canadian parish is among 65 scheduled to close as part of a massive reconfiguration of the archdiocese of boston. st. joseph school won't close, howev er. that will move across town to the old st. james school on federal street. the rev. lawrence rondeau, pastor of st. joseph, has appealed to archbishop sean p. o'malley to keep st. joseph open. in addition to the school, rondeau has cited the parish's thriving hispanic ministry, and a food pantry that serves 3,000 people each month in salem. if the parish closes, the sisters will lose their home. and salem has no other convent for them. other parishes closed or sold their convents amid a wave of catholic school closings in the 1970s. unlike parish priests, nuns do not work for the archdiocese. they work for their religious orders. ""we are not a diocesan community,"" said beauregard, the school's third-grade teacher. ""we belong to our congregation. . . . each parish with a school usually has a convent, but at st. james, there isn't one."" and if the convent closes, where will the sisters live? ""we don't know,"" said richard, 70, the school librarian. ""that's the honest truth."" since the parish closing was announced may 25, the sisters have spent much of their time consoling parishioners and reassuring parents that st. joseph school will stay open. they say they haven't had time to think about their own future. ""people here are upset,"" said richard, who grew up just blocks from the convent. ""we can't add to their burden. . . . i guess when the decision is final, we'll go see what's out there."" ""i know god will always take care of us,"" said grenier, 69, a special education teacher at the school. ""in the past, he always has . . . i cannot say i have lost my peace about this."" but st. joseph parents worry for the nuns' future. at a meeting last week to discuss the school move, a parent asked, ""what about our sisters?"" the sisters were asked to stand. they received a prolonged ovation from more than 100 parents and teachers that packed the school hall. monsignor paul v. garrity, the vicar for salem who ran the school meeting, didn't have an answer. ""it's one of those questions that really has to be looked at,"" he said. in an interview, garrity said the nuns probably will have to find their own housing. nuns involved in social work, health care, and other non-parish ministries often rent their own apartments. ""sisters today do receive a stipend,"" he said, adding he is sympathetic to the nuns. ""many of them come together to determine how they'll live."" the st. joseph nuns would like to stay together. ""this has been a wonderful community to be part of,"" said grenier, who moved to the convent 19 years ago. ""very good women live here."" but it may not be possible for them to stay together. a four-bedroom apartment or house is scarce. they also are expensive, particularly around st. james, which stands in the heart of the mcintire historic district, a neighborhood of stately federalist and georgian homes. ideally, they would like to be close to the school. the sisters, all of whom took a vow of poverty, pool their salaries. although they live rent-free at the convent, they pay for utilities, food, and other household necessities. each lives on a small budget to cover personal expenses, such as clothes and medications. when the school moves to st. james, the parish and school will pay their stipend. their order, too, will give them a stipend. but the sisters are still bracing for higher housing costs. ""it's going to be different,"" said richard, who takes care of convent finances. ""our order will help us some, but how much we're not sure."" although the sisters have quietly started asking around about apartments, they're prepared for the possibility that they may not be able to live together. ""the chances are not all of us will be together,"" said richard, who has lived at st. joseph for 33 years. ""we need space. we're used to having a whole house. . . . apartment living is going to be a big adjustment for us."" still, despite their own needs, the nuns remain focused on parish life. st. joseph serves salem's poorest neighborhood. more than half of its 900 families are hispanic, most of them immigrants from the dominican republic. the church has the only spanish mass in salem. it runs the largest food pantry. despite the many demands, the parish has no debt, parish officials said. the nuns thought st. joseph would survive the parish closings. they were heartened when o'malley said he would give special preference to parishes with schools, and serving new immigrants. ""when i heard that, i thought, 'we're out of the woods,' "" said beauregard. ""that's why this has all been so shocking."" they can't help but question the decision. ""i don't know what his [o'malley's] definition of poor is, if it is not here,"" richard said. ""i think these closings have not had any compassion for people,"" grenier said. ""from the start it has always been about buildings and property. that's where there has been no compassion."" beauregard has a special attachment to the convent. her uncle and father help build it in 1962, when the original convent had to be torn down. the new convent, with a private chapel and communal living space, had private bedrooms for 30 nuns. ""they built this house,"" she said proudly. and their quiet presence in the hardscrabble neighborhood has been a blessing. grenier discovered that on mother's day. as she was returning to the convent in the afternoon, a hispanic man in his 30s ran up to her. she recognized him as the man she waves to every day at the start of her 6 a.m. walk around salem. he gave her a big hug. ""he said to me 'happy mother's day, mom,' "" grenier said, a big smile on her face. ""i was so moved. nobody has ever said that to me. and he is just someone i wave to every day. i said to him, 'oh, my god. thank you. thank you.'

Newspapers,METRO/REGION;,,ARBORWAY TROLLEYS SEEN AS UNFEASIBLE,,,"restoring trolleys on the arborway line through jamaica plain would be nearly physically impossible and would hurt businesses, increase congestion, and pose a hazard for firetrucks, according to two preliminary studies due to be completed this summer. the studies, conducted by state researchers for the massachusetts bay transportation authority, will become part of an environmental impact report expected early next year on the $85 million project.    trolley restoration proponents say the t is trying to get out of a legal commitment to restore light-rail service on south huntington and centre streets that was discontinued in 1985. they say all the questions regarding the restoration have been raised and answered.","""they're seeing if they can outlast us,"" said franklyn salimbene, chairman of the arborway committee and a longstanding supporter of trolley restoration. ""all of this was studied and reviewed, and the upshot was, it's feasible, and it needs to proceed."" the t has argued for years that putting trolleys back on centre street is not feasible. but the agency has been unable to persuade state environmental officials, who say that the arborway trolley line is one of several transit projects the state promised to undertake as a condition for building the big dig. the arborway line, which has divided jamaica plain into pro-trolley and anti-trolley camps, is seen as a major test case for the transit commitments that the state made in a legally binding agreement linked to the $14.6 billion highway project. the romney administration - citing a shortage of funds, changing conditions since the agreement was made 15 years ago, and other projects that could cut car use - wants to prioritize the projects it attempts to finance. douglas o. foy, the chief of the office of commonwealth development, which is reviewing the estimated $6 billion in transit projects expected to be built during the next 25 years, said that a review of the arborway project ""is still under way, and we await its conclusions."" joe pesaturo, spokesman for mbta general manager michael mulhern, said that the t is conducting a ""rigorous analysis on factors such as traffic, parking, and public safety,"" while also looking at the arborway's likely ridership and how the project would improve air quality by reducing car use. but the preliminary study indicates the same number of people would take a clean-burning bus as a trolley, and cites major problems in the operation of the trolleys in a narrow corridor, according to state officials who described the draft reports. because the roadway is 44 feet wide in some places, and the trolleys must come flush with curbside platforms to comply with the americans with disabilities act, restoration of rail service could worsen congestion, according to the draft reports. car ownership in jamaica plain is up steeply since trolley service was discontinued in 1985, the draft report notes, and the business district has become steadily busier. restoration of trolley service would also eliminate parking spaces and complicate loading and delivery for area businesses, the draft report says; in addition, emergency vehicles would have difficulty coming in and out of the fire station on centre street. trolley proponents say those predictions are overly pessimistic. ""a lot of this is really quite simple,"" said salimbene. ""all anyone has to do is travel to portland, ore., or other places where they have in-street light rail."" the trolley stations would be consolidated from the current bus service stops, and would consist of a ""bumped out"" portion of the sidewalk, taking the place of one or two parking spaces, salimbene said. the loading area would be flush with the trolley for handicap access, he said. there are four lanes in the narrowest sections of centre street - one for parking on each side, and one travel lane in each direction. the tracks are in the travel lanes. the t argued several years ago that restoring trolley service was unfeasible, but the state department of environmental protection disagreed and effectively ordered the t to move ahead with the project. last year, state environmental secretary ellen roy herzfelder ruled that the t must proceed with planning for trolleys, and not a bus service alternative. but some merchants and residents are alarmed by the prospect of trolleys returning to centre street.  the project still has ""many unanswered questions,"" said paul schimek, head of the group better transit without trolleys. ""if someone double-parks, or parks improperly because of snow, no one will be able to pass. the trolleys will be stuck,"" he said. ""traffic flow will worsen, emergency vehicle access could be compromised, and all for nothing because there's no sense that transit service will be improved. if you want to get downtown quickly, you take the orange line."" bus service could be improved on the route with global-positioning satellite devices to prevent bunching, schimek said. in addition, air-quality goals from the big dig agreement could be met by retrofitting city vehicles so they use low-sulfur fuel, he said.  anthony flint can be reached at flint@globe.com.   ",['ENGLISH'],858,Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company,BGLOBE-0405170117,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '17', 'month': '05', 'year': '2004'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Civil Rights Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Environmental Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001477', 'className': 'RESEARCH REPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001956', 'className': 'POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00097CH', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00097R4', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6K', 'className': 'TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001940', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTNERTEzRUJDNEMzNDIwMzlDMTI5NTI0MTQzNDA2REY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM', 'className': 'Environmental Impact Statements'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000057', 'className': 'AIR QUALITY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzA3NTkyNjNCM0MzNDMwQjlCNDYzMzVCOTQ3M0UyRTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQxOUY2MEVDNUMyNEFDN0ExQzlENzQzQkYwQ0U2RjI', 'className': 'Americans With Disabilities Act'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001963', 'className': 'SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEVGRkVFM0VERTk5NERGMzk2QjAwMzczQTRFRkI1QkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk', 'className': 'Public Transportation'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N485112MM', 'className': 'URBAN RAIL SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N485110CC', 'className': 'URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk', 'className': 'Railroads & Rail Transportation'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N926120MM', 'className': 'TRANSPORTATION PLANNING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001794', 'className': 'VEHICLE TRAFFIC'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6K', 'className': 'TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00092PL', 'className': 'HIGHWAY FUNDING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N237300CC', 'className': 'ROAD & BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTFFNkIxMEVFQTA2NERDMDhDRUUwNUY2NEQ4MTYyOUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjVCODE3RDNEMENDNDkxRjg5MzBBNTJFQkNCRDlFOEU', 'className': 'Funding'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

""i think there's a softening of the culture, and there are a lot of people who are horrified by the tendency, but i think it's a maturing process - the stoic cast and the ignorance of things surrounding death is going away. i think we as a people are becoming a lot more sympathetic."" no one told george to turn to the web, and he had never seen a site like the one he set up, but the same idea is occurring to people all over the country. a page went up feb. 9 in memory of amanda lima. on ""amanda's page"" at http://www.capecod.net/amandaspage, the girl's portrait smiles out beside a plea for information from anyone with ""information about the sexual assault that preceded amanda's suicide"" or anyone who ""talked with amanda during the last few days of her life.""  no information has been passed on to state investigators by the family, but a suspect is in custody. still, family members have been overwhelmed by the e-mail they have received, said their lawyer, john thibbitts, who practices in centerville.  ""it's just amazing, what people have said to them,"" thibbitts said. ""do you know how people react to e-mail? they say things more intensely than they might do, because it might seem a little hokey. it's really helped the family to receive these messages.""  they are not alone. in 1996, when her son recommended she put up a web page to gather information about the 1989 slaying of her daughter kaitlyn, lois arquette, who now lives in north carolina, had no computer expertise. but after three years of maintaining the site - where you can hear a 12-year-old kaitlyn singing if you have the right software - arquette can't imagine how she could have sustained her family's investigation of the slaying without the thousands of messages and offers of help that have come in via computer.  ""these are people we've never met in person, we've never talked to on the phone,"" she said.  to arquette, though, the web site is valuable because it ""allows people to go above the heads of local law enforcement,"" who she believes conspired to cover up the nature of the slaying of her daughter. so when other families who have lost loved ones in unsolved crimes contact her - about 40 of them have already - one of the first things she tells them is to create a web site. her husband even offers to help them do it.  law enforcement professionals say they doubt that tips coming in over the web will ever replace old-fashioned investigation. since the fbi started posting fugitives' photographs and details of cases three years ago, only one case has definitively been solved because someone responded to a request for information, according to fbi spokesman frank scafidi. ""the internet is an enhancement of all the things law enforcement traditionally does,"" he said. ""we're not saying this is a big boon to law enforcement.""  but the world wide web has revolutionized the work of other agencies, such as the national center for missing and exploited children, which posts photographs immediately after a child has been abducted. a number of cases have been solved after someone identified a child on the web site, said the center's director, ernie allen. since the postings began three years ago, the number of daily visitors to the site has increased from 2,500 per day to 3.5 million, he said.  ""i would say in all candor it has exceeded anything we imagined,"" said allen. ""it takes us four to five hours to reach as many people by internet as we reached by phone in 15 years.""  agnieszka ziemlewski's family and friends don't know where the site will lead them; they just know that no other course of action was available to them. investigators are still hoping for a witness who could tie the suspect to the crime scene.  ""we're very optimistic,"" said sergeant alan fournier, a spokesman for the farmington police department. ""what we're looking for right now is one more piece of the puzzle, and we could lose that one piece that we need by saying the wrong thing. we're looking for someone who saw something.""  meanwhile, local people still give a wide berth to the wooded area where she was killed, and her close friends still have the shell-shocked quality of the recently bereaved, switching back and forth between past and present tenses when they talk about her. ziemlewski had emigrated from poland as a child, and struggled with alternatives to her difficult to pronounce polish name, settling, variously, on ""agnes"" and ""nicki."" she was the kind of person who chastised her friends for wearing dark colors while there was neon green in the world, said one high school classmate, whowas afraid to give her name, and who is now afraid to visit the gravesite alone for fear that the killer might show up. in a town where it suddenly seems too dangerous to mourn openly, ziemlewski's friends find themselves preferring the comforting anonymity of the world wide web.  ""i'll put it this way. i never used to lock my door. agnes used to yell at me because i'd leave the kitchen door wide open,"" said george. ""now it's like, you know, you lock the garage door. you lock the door that leads to the back yard. you close every door. you make sure all the windows were locked.""",['ENGLISH'],1218,Copyright 1999 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,",City Edition",The Boston Globe,"{'month': '03', 'day': '07', 'year': '1999'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Computer & Internet Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Evidence', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001566', 'className': 'SHOOTINGS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D4JV', 'className': 'CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY', 'className': 'Murder'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001803', 'className': 'VICTIMS RIGHTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D170', 'className': 'BOMBINGS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001647', 'className': 'SUICIDE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX001543', 'className': 'WALKING & JOGGING'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000954', 'className': 'INTERNET & WWW'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001829', 'className': 'WEBSITES'}, {'score': '51', 'classCode': 'STX000354', 'className': 'COMPUTER NETWORKS'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX583', 'className': 'OKLAHOMA CITY, OK, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX546', 'className': 'HARTFORD, CT, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS124', 'className': 'DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
,SPORTS; Pg. 61,,Mound of maturing from Expos' Hill,,,"there are those who will tell you that ken hill should have been the national league starter in last night's all-star game. he's won more games than anyone in the league, and his montreal expos are in first place. but the truth is that the righthander, a native of lynn, mass., is perfectly happy playing second fiddle to atlanta's greg maddux, the cy young winner the last two years. it is enough that he is enjoying a winning season and the expos are on a roll. anything else is gravy.","""i had a good first half,"" said hill, who has a 13-3 record. ""but the first half is over, and it's time for a fresh start. ""it's a lot more fun when you're winning. in montreal, we have some very good young talent and you can see it developing. we have five guys on this all-star team. i'm excited just watching these guys battling every night."" hill didn't attract a lot of attention early this year. he was coming off a 9-7 season that included a stint on the disabled list. overall, his record was 48-48, and critics wondered whether, at the age of 29, he would turn the corner or slide back into oblivion. even hill is surprised at how good he's become. the expos are 14-4 in his 18 starts, and if there is no strike, hill has an excellent chance to become a 20-game winner. ""have i thought about it?"" he said with a smile. ""seven games to go. hope i make it."" the knock on hill for years has been his inconsistency. the st. louis cardinals once considered him a premier starter. but he had trouble getting his forkball over and walked far too many batters, so they traded him to montreal in november 1991 for andres galarraga. this year, he has a 2-1 strikeout-walk ratio (78-37) and opponents are batting just .252 against him. so what's the difference? ""learning and getting to know myself,"" said hill. ""knowing what i'm capable of doing and not doing. it's not something that comes overnight. i tell the young guys on my team to try to learn as much as they can. the quicker you do, the better off you'll be on the mound. ""throwing strikes helps. it doesn't matter what ballpark i'm in. i can't change my game. i've still got to pitch the way i know how. you got a job to do, and you have to go out and do it. that's all i try to do. try to keep my team in the ballgame and give them an opportunity to win."" it hasn't hurt that the expos are averaging 6.1 runs a game when he works. hill is appreciative of the way his teammates have kept battling and improving at the same time. ""look at moises alou,"" said hill. ""he had a possible career-ending injury at the end of last season, but this year he's an all-star. wil cordero, an all-star. darrin fletcher and marquis grissom. they are all players who just got better."" hill knows it is a double-edged sword to have success in montreal. trade rumors predictably follow. sooner or later, the expos will have to either pay him big dollars or send him packing. ""i know their history,"" said hill. ""i hope they keep me around, but i don't know. i'll just have to wait until the time comes, and see what happens. ""they've talked about trading larry walker all year, and it hasn't happened. so you never know what they're going to do. you have no control."" the expos do have control of their destiny. they lead the atlanta braves by one game. it is a good sign. ""i think we're going to be right in there,"" said hill. ""i'm happy that we're playing good baseball. you never know what will happen with the strike thing. but if we're on top and there is a strike, we'll still be in first.

(the chef poking at them, eyes red and tearing, suffers so your food may be infused with smoke. someone get him some eye protection. the only bad seat in the house is the communal table directly in front of the fire, where it is unpleasantly hot and smoky.) a wide marble bar is a fine place to enjoy a solo supper or sip one of the well-made cocktails. bar manager nic mansur's list is streamlined in keeping with the restaurant's sensibility: a gimlet, a negroni, an old fashioned, a margarita. no need to embroider. the wine list is almost all french, with many organic or biodynamic selections. hi-rise regulars may recognize some bottles from the bakery. the food, too, is francophile if not french, seasonal and local, as if it needs to be said. dishes appear to be alternately prepared by peasants and fairies, with an occasional assist from a toddler enamored of finger painting. the menu leads with snacks (""petite""): ricotta scented with chamomile, alongside rye crackers with honey; sausage pinwheeled and skewered, blackened in spots from the fire, and served with charred lemon. these are elemental and satisfying. move on to the ""moins petite"" — oh, the tortured terminology the rise of small plates has created. there is the loveliest tomato salad around, made with fat, ripe slices of different hues and handfuls of halved cherry tomatoes sprinkled in white, irregular shapes: crags of creamy, sea salt-spiked feta and popped kernels of corn. the plate blooms with fronds of anise hyssop. shepard's dishes contain the entire herb patch — tarragon, thai basil, lovage. for anyone with a vegetable garden, the pleasures of restaurant dining at this time of year, in this era, can dull: ""these tomatoes served up like holy relics? i have more than i can handle at home. my blood runs gazpacho; i eat charred eggplants for breakfast. i'm starting to pickle the pickles."" but shepard reenvisions ingredients with such originality, one is happy to see them again. baby leeks are gone but not forgotten. charred sweet and tender, they came with green romesco sauce, a cambridge cousin of catalonia's calcots. shepard's version of a salad involves burned escarole with pine nuts, currants, and jagged flakes of cracker dough. to those not fond of wood-fired food: shepard may not be your cup of lapsang souchong. order a certain combination of dishes and the whole meal comes to the table burned. everything might also be served over various splatters of beige, tahini-esque puree. it can get repetitive. change cures that. for a time, striped bass heads and tails were served with chili remoulade and breakfast radishes, heavenly leftovers. beet cappellacci, now off the menu, were pasta hats in a smoky, lusty tomato sauce with hunks of lobster, sprigs of thai basil, and slivers of candy-striped beets (take that, north end fra diavolo). and the gnocchi served when the restaurant first opened, tender, almost stretchy, with morels and peas, are a sweet but distant memory. instead there are basil pici, dark strands of chewy hand-rolled pasta, accented with roasted cherry tomatoes and house-made striper bottarga (use every part of that fish). tender grilled octopus comes with smoked eggplant and chanterelles, unexpectedly pickled, the flavor bright against the other ingredients. restaurants try everything these days to get repeat business, from fried chicken nights to trivia competitions. a constantly changing menu continually filled with compelling dishes might be the best ploy there is. shepard doesn't lose momentum with its ""grande"" plates. the soupe de poisson is a bowlful of littlenecks, red-skinned potato (unfortunately undercooked), and a tautog head complete with fins and tender cheek meat. the best part is the broth, complex and piquant with poblano peppers. and larger dishes are the finest reason to have a wood fire. witness the perfectly grilled bavette steak, served on a wood board with grated radish mounded atop its own roots and leaves. as for shepard's half-chicken, it's the kind of thing that can make a restaurant — juicy, crisp-skinned, hacked into pieces and served with sweet, soft cipollini onions and a green sauce bright with lovage. it is so good, so simple, one could eat it every week with joy. where things do falter is dessert. the restaurant takes the dialing-back-on-sugar thing to heart. a rhubarb galette with buttermilk ice cream is downright sour. a grilled doughnut with coffee ice cream has the texture of a bagel. a buckwheat waffle is thin and tough, like a pizzelle crossed with a crepe, and the accompanying roasted watermelon sorbet is flavorless and an unattractive shade of brown. sumac enhances its sourness. the best things are the simplest: blueberry frozen yogurt sprinkled with granola and lemon balm, a perfect peach with honey, creme fraiche, and shiso. with that simplicity, with its relaxed finesse, shepard is a fine new england analogue to berkeley's chez panisse. it is so good to see regis and crew setting things on fire. devra first can be reached at dfirst@globe.com follow her on twitter @devrafirst.",['ENGLISH'],1305,Copyright 2015 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-a6133044-45d7-11e5-acd3-140af290720a,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '26', 'month': '08', 'year': '2015'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001483', 'className': 'RESTAURANT REVIEWS'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTE4OEI3QTY5NkI3NDNEMDk5QkU4NkVGMDEyMUZEMTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk', 'className': 'Accessibility Requirements in Public Facilities'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000DL68', 'className': 'DRAWING & ILLUSTRATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001482', 'className': 'RESTAURANTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001483', 'className': 'RESTAURANT REVIEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001903', 'className': 'FOOD INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'STX000424', 'className': 'CREDIT CARDS'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTE4OEI3QTY5NkI3NDNEMDk5QkU4NkVGMDEyMUZEMTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk', 'className': 'Accessibility Requirements in Public Facilities'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,A sense of betrayal follows law allowing cut in pensions,,,"washington — congress has played the grinch this holiday season for some retirees. tucked into the federal spending bill were provisions that will allow certain struggling multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefits already being received by retirees. the move was a result of an alarm from the pension benefit guaranty corp.that some multiemployer plans — covering more than 1 million participants — are substantially underfunded and, without legislative changes, would probably fail. the deficit for pbgc's multiemployer insurance program has jumped to $42.4 billion, up from $8.3 billion last year. in all, multiemployer plans provide benefits to more than 10 million workers and retirees in industries such as building and construction, retail, manufacturing, trucking and transportation. the pbgc said it has enough assets to meet the needs of plans currently in trouble, but there are insufficient funds to cover benefits for plans expected to run out of money in coming years.","body now those troubled multiemployer plans that estimate they won't have enough money to pay 100 percent of benefits within 15 or 20 years can cut benefits, according to the pension rights center. retirees who are 80 or older or who receive a disability pension can't have their benefits reduced. for retirees 75 to 79, the cuts will be smaller than those who are under 75. ""it's heartbreaking,"" said karen friedman, executive vice president for pension rights center. ""we are getting calls and letters from people who are scared. they are the most vulnerable. they can't go and get another job. they were told they would have a pension for the rest of their life."" but there are many retirees who don't even know they are affected by the change, she said. the department of labor keeps a list of multiemployer plans that are in ""critical"" and ""endangered"" status, friedman said. you can find the list by going to dol.gov and search for ""2014 critical status notices."" the direct link is www.dol.gov/ ebsa/criticalstatusnotices.html. ""but just because a pension plan is on the list doesn't mean there will be cuts to benefits,"" friedman said. ""it's going to take a while for all of this to get settled."" the pension rights center has a good summary of the pension provisions on its website at pensionrights.org. there is also a calculator to help you figure out how much your benefits could be cut. plans that are considered in critical status will be authorized to cut retiree benefits provided they satisfy other criteria specified in the law, according to the summary. workers and retirees should have received a notice that their plan is severely underfunded, but it's not unusual for people to overlook it, the center says. there are certain limits to how much plan trustees can cut. trustees also have to notify all plan members, the center points out, and those plans with 10,000 or more participants must appoint a retiree to represent the interest of pensioners. one part of the law that should be fixed is the fact that there presently isn't a provision to restore lost benefits if a plan's financial situation improves. even if you are not affected by the legislation, its passage is historic — it signals a crack in a door so many felt couldn't be opened. it sets a precedent. you might not even know the name of the law that was written to give people with private pensions a sense of security. it's the employee retirement income security act of 1974, or erisa. as part of the law, congress created the pbgc to make sure pensions are protected. it now oversees the benefits of more than 41 million americans in private-sector pension plans. the agency says it is directly responsible for paying the benefits of about 1.5 million people in failed plans. i know for many of those impacted by the change that it is hard to imagine living on less. retirees worked for so long, sticking with the same company and counting on their work and dedication to translate into a pension check that would last to the end of their lives. there were many outside factors that led to the current state of the troubled plans. but nonetheless, plan participants should feel betrayed. the rest of us should share their pain because a sacrosanct promise that has stood for the last 40 years — that once you earn benefits and retire, your pension is set in stone — has been broken. personal finance michelle singletary can be reached at michelle.singletary@washpost.com follow her on twitter @singletarym.",['ENGLISH'],845,Copyright 2014 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-44f14f7a-87c9-11e4-8e5d-fbbee65d8f7e,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '26', 'month': '12', 'year': '2014'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Civil Rights Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Tax Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX001307', 'className': 'PENSION & RETIREMENT PLANS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzNEOEE3NjhDNTJBNDhCOTgxRkQzNzc1Q0JCMkU4Q0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Pensions & Benefits'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001959', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097YY', 'className': 'RETIREE HEALTH PLANS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000107', 'className': 'APPROPRIATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST00097CK', 'className': 'LABOR DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX001307', 'className': 'PENSION & RETIREMENT PLANS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097YY', 'className': 'RETIREE HEALTH PLANS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N525110MC', 'className': 'PENSION FUNDS'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Terriers draw Kansas,BU gets chance to make history,,"fresh off punching their ticket to the ncaa tournament, the boston university basketball team gathered at a restaurant near agganis arena to watch yesterday's selection show, anxious to learn its seeding, opponent, and destination.","the terriers received the no. 16 seed in the southwest regional and face top-seeded kansas on friday at 6:50 p.m. at the bok center in tulsa, okla. ``i haven't had this feeling in a long time, since i was at villanova and we were the last team in,'' said bu coach pat chambers. ``you're sitting there and you've got butterflies and . . . when you see we've got kansas, you're like, wow, we get to go to oklahoma and play kansas, what a great thrill for these guys, for this program, [and] for this university.'' the terriers (21-13), the only boston-area school in the field of 68, are riding an 11-game winning streak, culminating with their sixth america east title. the 56-54 win over stony brook gave the terriers their first trip to the big dance since 2002. ``we're passionate about the direction of this program,'' chambers said. ``this is going to be a thrill for us. i'm enjoying the spotlight.'' bu has never faced kansas, ranked no. 2 in both major polls. ``i just want [us] to compete,'' said chambers. ``i think we have a young group that hasn't reached their potential yet . . . i don't think we've really played up to our capabilities. i'm just hoping to come to practice tomorrow and get better and who knows? we are just going to compete, play hard, and on friday we'll see what happens.'' the terriers hope america east player of the year john holland continues playing like he did in the second half against stony brook. after a quiet start, holland (who averages 19.2 points per game) erupted for 23 second-half points to help bu overcome a 15-point deficit and earn the automatic bid. holland isn't feeling intimidated. ``we played kentucky. we played villanova, so i don't think it has anything to do with [us] being intimidated, it's just a matter of executing and hopefully you end up with the opportunity to do something special,'' he said. if bu stands any chance, holland will need some help from junior guard matt griffin, who has seen kansas suffer an ncaa tournament first-round upset in person. griffin watched his brother, john, help no. 14 seed bucknell stun the third-seeded jayhawks in 2005. ``it's something i've been watching since i was little,'' griffin said. ``i would run home from school just to see the first round. my brother played in it for two years, and i was fortunate enough to watch him. ``finally to get a chance to sit down and actually watch your own school get its name called, it's an unbelievable feeling.'' no 16 seed has ever won a game in the tournament. holland isn't ruling it out: ``it's got to happen eventually, so you never know.''",['ENGLISH'],469,Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-GJO1OA7IL.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '14', 'month': '03', 'year': '2011'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C9ZK', 'className': 'COLLEGIATE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009IRB', 'className': 'SPORTS AWARDS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C9ZK', 'className': 'COLLEGIATE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX533', 'className': 'TULSA, OK, USA'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS152', 'className': 'OKLAHOMA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Newspapers,SPORTS;,,PLAYING PICK UP STICKS,,"By Kevin Paul Dupont, Globe Staff ","megan quill is 8 years old, which is just a little too young for any formal lacrosse training or games in her hometown, but she has been toting around a lacrosse stick almost everywhere for the last couple of years. according to her father, it has become the thing for girls her age to do all around norwell. ""really, all the older girls in the neighborhood play that's what got her hooked,"" said john quill, a 35-year-old attorney who grew up in quincy, thinking lacrosse was ""only for the rich kids played in the noble & greenoughs of the world.""     in acton, hank hamilton's oldest son, 11-year-old travis, switched to lacrosse a couple of years ago when he grew bored with soccer. hockey is travis's first love, but lacrosse, with many of its skills and rules nearly identical to the ice game, has edged toward the top of his busy sports schedule to the point, his father believes, he might one day choose it over baseball.","""by and large, this is a sport new to all the parents of the kids who are playing it,"" said the 49-year-old hamilton, a software engineer originally from winchester. ""because of that, parents can't help them much when they're out there, can't coach them, can't tell them what to do. you know, underneath it all, maybe that's what the kids like about it. it's their own game, and parents aren't yelling stupid stuff from the sidelines. it's more like sports when we were kids."" whatever the attraction, lacrosse is red hot, the fastest growing youth sport in the nation, according to some reports. a lengthy april 25 sports illustrated story reported that 186,000 us kids under age 15, double the figure of just four years ago, play in youth lacrosse leagues. in a number of massachusetts towns and municipalities, sudbury and newton and duxbury among them, lacrosse-for-tots programs (ages 5-8) have sprung up in recent years. lacrosse sticks now dot suburban front lawns and driveways the way hula hoops littered the lot in the late-1950s and early-'60s. a game that dates back centuries here in north america suddenly has american kids convinced that cradling is cool and shooting from the hip is an athletic art form. ""this is our first year with a u-9 program in sudbury,"" said brian vona, 35, the head coach of the lincoln-sudbury high school boys' lacrosse team, and a sudbury resident with two pre-schoolers in the program. ""we posted it on our website, sudbury youth lacrosse, and figured we'd get maybe 25 kids, tops. first day, we show up, there's more than 80 kids who want to play all of 'em 5,-6,-7-and 8-year-olds. that's a staggering number."" according to vona, the cost for each tyke is $75 to play in the u-9 program, and equipment, including helmet, stick, and protective padding, adds up to approximately another $150. a sudbury youth lacrosse clinic next friday, part of a buddy program (lax-links) that pairs u-9 players with sudbury high schoolers, will have 300 athletes in uniform on the lincoln-sudbury high school field. ""they all take a lap around the field together the little kids mixed in with the big kids,"" said vona. it's a far cry, he added, from his senior year at newton north high school (1987) when only 25 eastern mass. high schools had boys varsity lacrosse. today, he said, the number stands at 153. ""the way it's growing, in a few years i don't know, maybe 10? lacrosse will totally blow soccer away,"" said vona. ""it will be considered one of the top five sports in the country. i can't tell you how many times we get kids who've had enough of baseball, and they come to us and love it. on the other hand, we haven't lost a kid to baseball yet. when you come over, you come over to this sport for life."" city development    in boston and cambridge and chelsea, metro lacrosse over the last five years has built a program specifically for inner-city youth, grades 5 through 12, that this spring has 500-plus athletes, predominantly minorities, playing on 30-plus teams. initially funded by a family grant, metro lacrosse doesn't charge participants to play, and every player receives his or her equipment for free. ""we've brought the game to what have traditionally been underserved neighborhoods,"" noted program director ben gildin. ""traditionally, lacrosse has been a white, upper-class sport, but that has changed dramatically in the last 5-10 years. there has been massive expansion, leading out from the hotbeds of baltimore, long island, and the new england prep schools, to throughout the east coast, california, colorado, ohio and the midwest. here in the cities, i won't say it's mainstream, yet but it's more known, and it's definitely more visible."" gone are the days, said gildin, when metro lacrosse representatives visited a middle-school gym class, looking for recruits, only to ""get back these looks, like we had three heads"" when they displayed their long sticks with attached baskets, and helmets with birdcage face protectors. ""now we'll walk in and right away, you hear the kids say, 'wow, it's lacrosse . . . oh, cool!' maybe they haven't played, but they've seen a brother, a cousin or a friend play it,"" said gildin. originally the sport of native north americans, who considered it a near-spiritual calling, the first lacrosse games sometimes went on for days, without boundaries, and could be played across a stretch of miles. the sport is widely held as the first played on this continent. until approximately the early-1980s, despite its wide appeal in 19th and 20th century canada, it was truly a niche sport in the united states, dwarfed by the more traditional pastimes of football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer.    much like hockey, the boys' version of the game, as well as the professional game, is full of confrontation and contact. the girls' game is considered a noncontact sport, played without a helmet, and only recently has moved to include mandatory eye protection for all players. ""it's a sport that favors the quick, the strong, the smart and the crazy,"" said vona, a former goalie who played professionally for seven of the years the boston blazers (indoor lacrosse) were housed on causeway street. ""i'm only 5 feet 9, and that's on a good day, in cleats. i was too small to play baseball, and too small to play basketball. but i made it to all-american in high school. lacrosse is like a cult. you don't just play it. you don't just like it. it's in you. you live lacrosse."" by the numbers in eastern mass., the massachusetts bay youth lacrosse league (mbyll.org) is the largest grassroots promoter of the game. mbyll president blaine hebbel said only 12 towns were enrolled in the program when it began in 1992. today, 110 towns, split into five regions, are under the mbyll emass umbrella, with an enrollment of some 10,000 kids. ""our mission,"" said hebbel, noting that won-loss records aren't tallied or recorded in mbyll play, ""is to teach the sport, grow it, and make sure the kids have fun playing it."" mbyll will host its lacrosse jamboree over two weekends, june 11-12 and june 18-19, at fort devens, with some 400 teams and 8,000 athletes. as many as 14 games, in varying age groups, will be played simultaneously. ben hincks, an attorney who lives in newton, recently helped launch his city's u-9 lacrosse program. similar to what happened in sudbury, newton youth lacrosse figured initial turnout would be low, perhaps around 15, only to find 40 kids knocking on the door the first day. ""i wouldn't be surprised if we doubled that next year,"" said hincks, who grew up in connecticut and played the game at yale. ""it's just a great sport. it moves fast. it has lots of scoring. i love baseball, but it's far more aerobically challenging. you know, i've never heard anyone say a bad word about the gameonce they've seen it.""     a kids sports report on lacrosse will be featured on the globe's ""sportsplus"" show on nesn tonight (6:30) and tomorrow night (7) prior to red sox broadcasts. senior staff writer kevin paul dupont's e-mail address is dupont@globe.com.   ",['ENGLISH'],1329,Copyright 2005 Globe Newspaper Company,BGLOBE-0505130091,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '13', 'month': '05', 'year': '2005'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000A0LE', 'className': 'LACROSSE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D9GY', 'className': 'SPORTS INSTRUCTION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Intercollegiate & Interscholastic Athletics'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000848', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001589', 'className': 'WINTER SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X80', 'className': 'YOUTH SPORTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000170', 'className': 'BASEBALL'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001587', 'className': 'SOCCER'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000848', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000A39R', 'className': 'COMPUTER SOFTWARE'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'GR120', 'className': 'NORTH AMERICA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Cruel and unusual,"For two senior athletes, this was their year to finally start — until a pandemic hit",,"carter walsh was hoping to lead a woburn team that reached the division 1 north final last season. this was last spring, when the chapter on a most memorable baseball season was officially closing. the laughs, cheers, toasts, and hugs over a casual dinner inside a rented hall were doing all they could to celebrate woburn's run to the division north 1 final, to remember the team's first league title since 1978, to express gratitude to the 12 graduating seniors who had led the way. joe wells is as woburn as they come. he has the pedigree, playing for woburn, graduating in 1991, before returning to coach his alma mater. his full-time career (after a few years as a teacher) is as a woburn police officer. so rest assured he was as thrilled as anyone with the accomplishments of the season. but coaches aren't built to idle. so even as that amazing celebratory banquet was wrapping up, wells was looking forward, seeking out his top juniors, guys whose chance to shine beckoned for 2020.","body among them was john kyle, a pitcher who'd contributed so much as a reliever to the deep playoff run, but who in any other year would have been a top-of-the-rotation starter and off-day shortstop. ""he's a highly competitive kid, a soccer player as well, one of those kids that doesn't want to come off the field,"" wells said of his returning captain. ""this season would have been it. i told him that at the banquet. ""i know how frustrated he was, and i remember saying to him, 'don't plan on coming off the field this year.' he wanted to be on the field so much."" ""i was looking forward to getting a bigger role,"" kyle agreed, ""getting more at-bats and playing shortstop more, and also having a bigger role as a leader this year."" his fellow juniors felt similarly. take carter walsh, a talented pitcher who couldn't crack the varsity staff, leading the way on jv instead, ready now for a high school finale as a starter and outfielder. he planned out his offseason, booking time in the weight room, ready to work himself into the best baseball shape of his life, ready to log his first varsity inning. ""he was going to be a big part of this year's rotation and in the same boat as john, being on the field all the time, either in the outfield or on the mound,"" wells said. ""any other year since i've been in the program, he would have been up with the varsity last year, but because we were such a senior-laden team, there wasn't an opportunity for him to even play, to even pitch in the rotation as a reliever. ""all winter they were working out and gearing up for the season, doing their workouts on their own, throwing on their own leading up to the season. it was all a ton of positive stuff."" until it wasn't. until a virus came and took it all away. until life pulled the proverbial rug out from under their field of dreams. students shifted to online classes, zooming with their teachers, taking online ap tests, moving relatively seamlessly into the virtual world. but sports? sports can't happen virtually. seasons were suspended, put on hiatus, left in limbo. hope hung around, at least for a while. there were plans for a shortened schedule, salvaging something of a season. even as those faded, new ideas sprouted; perhaps a home-and-home series against a rival school would salvage something for the seniors. honorable ideas all. but feasible? none. now, the words from that banquet only sting. ""i can't deliver on that promise,"" wells said. the pandemic has done an extraordinary job of spreading heartbreak along with illness, and the blow it has struck to so many rites of passage leaves a generation of kids with a litany of laments. yet there is something particularly poignant in the experiences of kyle and walsh, players whose one shining moment was extinguished by circumstances beyond their control, young men robbed of that beautiful opportunity to take center stage, to earn the ultimate high school reward for years of hard work. ""i remember when the initial decision happened, it was supposed to be two weeks, and i thought, 'that's not that bad, we'll be back around may,' "" walsh said, ""then when it got pushed back again, i just knew there was no way it was going to happen. it's frustrating."" there is no special tonic here, or even unique insight. when a situation stinks, sometimes the best we can do is acknowledge the pain and sadness, making the mere act of recognition an important cog in the healing process. baseball has been a part of these kids' lives since they were just hitting school age. they've played with friends, been coached by parents, spent hours traveling to the same tournaments and sitting on the same sidelines. ""i always figured we'd play some games at least,"" kyle said. ""when it hit that it wasn't happening, it still didn't really sink in. but a week or so later, it started to get nice out and i just wanted to play baseball. i've been doing it this time of year my whole life."" ""this was the year,"" said kyle's father, robert, wistfulness barely masking the sadness. robert's own father played pro ball, and when young john wanted to play too, robert didn't just sign up to coach but ended up spending years on the board of the little league. yet as much fun as those games were, as great as the travel ball experience was, senior year of high school is just different. ""devastating,"" robert said. ""it was a tremendous disappointment. obviously it's nobody's fault, and there's nothing anybody could do to change it. johnny's got a pretty stiff upper lip, and he said it's no big deal, but i told him, 'i know better than that.' "" in some years, as wells sees the spring approaching, he has to cajole the kids to stay attentive, knowing they want to cut loose for prom, for the beach, for graduation parties, and friend time.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,"Los Angeles teachers, city reach tentative deal to end weeklong strike",,,striking los angeles teachers cheered on tuesday after their union reached a deal that included smaller class sizes. los angeles — los angeles public-school teachers reached a tentative deal with school officials tuesday to end a weeklong strike that had upended learning for more than a half million students in the nation's second-largest school system.,"body the teachers won a 6 percent pay raise and caps on class sizes, which had become one of the most contentious issues between the union and district officials. the city and county will also spend money to expand services in schools, including hiring more nurses, counselors, and psychologists. the settlement came after tens of thousands of teachers marched in downtown los angeles and picketed outside schools for six school days and a round of marathon negotiating sessions over the holiday weekend. the contract still needs to be ratified by members of the union, but that approval is widely expected. teachers are expected to be back in their classrooms wednesday morning. ""today is a day full of good news,"" mayor eric garcetti said during a news conference at city hall on tuesday morning, as he stood alongside austin beutner, superintendent of the los angeles unified school district, and alex caputo-pearl, president of united teachers los angeles. the victory for the teachers' union goes beyond the new two-year contract. the strike attracted widespread public support and sympathy, and helped to change the way teachers are perceived both in los angeles and around the country. the strike also drew attention to how california, one of the wealthiest and most liberal states in the country, spends relatively little on its public schools. the state's chronically constrained school spending is largely attributed to its property tax laws, and especially to proposition 13, a ballot initiative passed in 1978 that drastically limits tax rates and makes increases difficult to enact. affluent, fast-growing suburban communities have suffered less under the law than large urban systems like the los angeles unified school district, where declining enrollment and rising costs for pensions and health care have created budget problems year after year. with fewer than half the district's students attending school during the strike, officials said the walkout had cost the district roughly $125 million in state financing that is distributed based on attendance. new york times",['ENGLISH'],428,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-d08e7540-1e87-11e9-b294-f23b94f5ffa2,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '23', 'month': '01',

,NATIONAL/FOREIGN; Pg. 1,,Nebraskan fueling German neo-Nazis,,,"gerhard lauck works hard to dispel people's assumptions about neo-nazis: he laughs frequently, makes self-effacing jokes and stresses that he promotes only nonviolent change. ""i'm just a big, kind, lovable teddy bear,"" he insists. civil rights and law enforcement officials around the world, particularly in germany, describe this american citizen in other terms: as an evil, dangerous provocateur. they say, and lauck agrees, that he is the no. 1 producer of neo-nazi propaganda distributed in germany, where even the possession of such material is outlawed. indeed, after quietly producing his wares for two decades in america's heartland, lauck is being thrust into an international spotlight by the post-reunification surge of neo-nazi activity in germany, and his role in promoting it.","lauck, during a two-hour interview near his home outside lincoln, maintained that his mission was just to help white people understand their interest in installing a fourth reich through electoral means. but german authorities say that his efforts have been anything but democratic, and that they fueled racial hatred and fomented violence. for instance, they said inflammatory stickers, newspapers and other materials traced to lauck were found during investigations of more than 70 hate crimes in 1991. and his influence, by all accounts, has mushroomed. while his background is somewhat sketchy, it is known that in 1972, lauck, at age 19, founded the national socialist german workers party-overseas organization, which has an estimated membership of fewer than 500 in this country. with the exception of the last two words, the group's name is identical to that of adolf hitler's nazi party. lauck subsequently engaged in a host of neo-nazi activities in the united states and abroad, but he has become most successful publishing a newspaper called ""the new order,"" printed in 10 languages. it includes virulent attacks on minority groups and jews. it features ads for nazi literature, tapes and cassettes of hitler's speeches, and it offers suggestions on how to smuggle such material into countries that prohibit its existence on their soil. fbi director louis freeh promised last month during a trip to germany to crack down on us purveyors of neo-nazi writings and paraphernelia. he did not cite lauck by name, but officials in both countries said in interviews that he was the chief target of freeh's vow. the officials acknowledged that pinning lauck down for a specific crime may prove difficult, however, since he and others often operate from this country expressly because of its constitutional protections. ""the problem is that his activities are not illegal in the united states,"" said susanne karkowski of the bundesamt fur verfassungsschutz, the german equivalent of the fbi. ""it's not for nothing that he operates from somewhere where he finds himself in a legal nirvana."" lauck does not reveal the location of his printing presses or the identities of his coworkers (""they have wives and children""). armed with the first amendment, he generally wages his international battles from close to home. he also sells his products domestically, but us officials dismiss his activities here as insignificant compared with their impact in germany and, to a lesser extent, in the splintered states of the former soviet union. ""it's one thing for this material to be distributed in new york, where there's so much of this kind of stuff and people are used to fringe politics, for example, but it's another thing for lauck's propaganda to act as virtually a match in the tinderboxes of central and eastern europe,"" said tom halperin, who along with irwin suall is director of fact-finding for the anti-defamation league of b'nai b'rith. dressed neatly in dark gray slacks, light gray sportcoat, white shirt and gray-striped tie, lauck repeatedly sought during an interview last week to stress a preference for nonviolence. the bloodthirsty images that the ""jewish-dominated media"" and ""germany's dictatorship"" seek to create, he said, are false and distorted. as if to underline his point, lauck presented even his most strident views in moderate tones, laced his comments with historical and literary references, and projected an affable persona. but the examples he cited of his good intentions belied the self-image he sought to project. he said he promoted force, for instance, only as a last resort to ""deprive jews of power"" and to get them to live in isolation. ""we could dictate terms before taking action,"" he suggested. ""if you will cease and desist from trying to subvert western civilization and exterminating the white race, then we can make a truce. . . . i don't care if we sit down and talk to these people or if we exterminate them, but i'd prefer to talk."" likewise, although he would like to segregate blacks in a country of their own, he said he would first try to do so through negotiation, because he felt sympathy for them. ""it's like, i love my dog, too,"" he said. ""i don't beat my dog, and i feed him . . . but i don't give him equal rights or have sex with him."" even on key questions such as inducing poland to cede land to germany, lauck tried to offer clever solutions. ""we'll offer to bribe them, give them economic aid, which they'll take,"" he said, "". . . because we'll also tell them if you don't do this, we'll invade you and take back the territory and massacre you."" groups that monitor extremists - such as the anti-defamation league, the simon weisenthal center and the southern poverty law center - have tracked lauck for most of the 20 years he has been in the propaganda business. the fbi and the justice department's civil rights division have extensive files on him, according to officals of both agencies. as evidenced by the fact that he is still in business, dealing with extremists like lauck raises nettlesome legal, constitutional and ethical issues. john kundts of the fbi said ""it's more complex than a murder case or even a white-collar crime"" to determine how the self-styled propagandist can be prosecuted, since his operations are legal. but critics such as aaron breitbart, senior researcher at the wiesenthal center, pointed out that other democracies find ""it's perfectly legitimate to regulate freedom of expression at the point where, as with lauck, it leads to attacks and violence."" moreover, breitbart and others maintain that news organizations that write about neo-nazis may do some good by exposing their activities, but simultaneously provide their subjects with free publicity. on that count, at least, lauck agrees with his detractors. ""if you print an article in boston, mass., or any major city with a race problem, saying there's a guy publishing stickers that say 'deport niggers,' and he's in lincoln, neb., even if everything else says i'm a total monster or a total nut or a total lunatic - when i'm only 95 percent of those things - there will be people who want some of those stickers and write for literature,"" he said. ""then you get more literature in the field, and you get more support, you get more subscribers."" lauck was born in milwaukee in 1953 to parents of german ancestry, moved to lincoln as a child and began reading books such as hitler's ""mein kampf"" in his early teens. he said he skipped his senior year of high school, then concentrated on german-related courses during two years at the university of nebraska. at about age 17, gary rex lauck adopted the name gerhard ""for ethnic identification,"" and later apparently assumed something like a german accent and grew a mustache trimmed much like hitler's. lauck denied he affects an accent, saying his ""distinctive voice"" comes from having lived in milwaukee or having listened to german-speaking grandparents. while he portrays himself as relatively reasonable and said he was accepted by his parents and two siblings despite his views, police records paint a different picture. they show he was arrested in february 1978 for shooting his brother jerry, apparently after an argument about lauck's activities. jerry lauck survived, left the state and declined to press charges. lauck closely guards his activities, and german officals also do not like to discuss them. but sources said he routinely has used the us mail, often sending nondescript packages to phony post-office boxes, and also smuggled tons of material in the trunks of cars traveling over the german border from adjoining nations. he has been arrested in germany three times: in 1972 for distributing nazi literature, in 1974 for delivering a speech about ""why hitler is still so popular in the united states"" and in 1976 for toting around 20,000 nazi stickers. after serving 4 1/2 months in jail on that last charge, he was expelled from germany for life, although he was allowed back in 1979 to testify at a trial.  in the interview, lauck said he also has sneaked into the country several times since but prefers to meet with collaborators in neighboring nations. suall, of the anti-defamation league, was among several us officials who expressed hope that newfound fbi interest in lauck might finally lead to legal action against him.  ""this is a guy who provides ammunition to the most hateful kinds of people and, worse, influences young people,"" said suall. ""he's sufficiently dangerous . . . that his activities should be exposed, so concern becomes widespread enough for the american government to do something.""",['ENGLISH'],1580,Copyright 1994 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '01', 'day': '11', 'year': '1994'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DA0C', 'className': 'RACISM & XENOPHOBIA'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D9R3', 'className': 'ETHNIC CONFLICTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000302', 'className': 'CIVIL RIGHTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DIUR', 'className': 'MINORITY GROUPS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Constitutional Law'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZCNDNCMENDOTVGNEFBNEE0RTBGREIyQ0IzMjk0QUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTYyODU4NTlDMkZFNEUzRTk1RUZGNzQyNjVEOEI5REU', 'className': 'Smuggling'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC318', 'className': 'GERMANY'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",METRO,,Entwistle seeks release on bail Wants to await trial in England,,Jonathan Saltzman GLOBE STAFF,"ten months after he was arrested in london in the gunshot slayings of his wife and infant daughter, neil entwistle has asked a middlesex superior court judge to free him from jail and let him return to his native england until he goes on trial next year.","lawyers for entwistle acknowledged in the written request filed tuesday that the hopkinton murders in january generated a blizzard of news coverage on both sides of the atlantic, and predicted the motion to free him from the middlesex county jail would probably meet with ""media reaction and cynicism."" but defense lawyers elliot m. weinstein and stephanie page said they ""cannot be cowed"" by such reactions and asserted that intensive news coverage of the case would make it impossible for their client to flee. ""this is a man who cannot run and cannot hide,"" the motion said. emily lagrassa, a spokeswoman for middlesex district attorney martha coakley, said prosecutors will oppose the request at a pretrial hearing scheduled for dec. 15. ""we just don't think this is appropriate, given the nature of the case and the flight risk,"" she said. entwistle took a flight to england soon after his 27-year-old wife, rachel, and 9-month-old daughter, lillian, were killed in their hopkinton house on jan. 20, according to prosecutors. hopkinton police discovered the bodies in the master bedroom two days later. although entwistle left the country, his lawyers said, he spoke with the massachusetts state police almost daily by phone from his parents' house and did not challenge extradition upon his arrest. in addition, they said, he had an ""unblemished personal history and background."" they asked judge peter m. lauriat to impose several conditions for entwistle's release, including requirements that he be confined to his parents' home in worksop, england; that he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet; that he report daily by phone to british or american law enforcement authorities; and that his parents put up their house as security to ensure that he returns to the united states. the motion does not explain why entwistle is seeking his release now, and his lawyers did not return calls. joseph flaherty, a lawyer and retired commander of a state police homicide unit who is a spokesman for rachel entwistle's mother and stepfather, priscilla and joseph matterazzo, said the family is ""totally opposed"" to entwistle's release. ""they don't feel that it's going to happen, given the seriousness of the case, the fact that he's not even a us citizen, and the strength of the investigation and the case itself,"" he said. entwistle's trial is tentatively scheduled to start april 27, said lagrassa. jonathan saltzman can be reached at jsaltzman@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],449,Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5590081,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '07', 'month': '12', 'year': '2006'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
,LIFE AT HOME;,,CUPPED BOARDS IN FLOORS NEED WORK,,,"q. about 12 boards in the hardwood floor in my kitchen are cupping, and of course they are right in the middle. they are not buckling, but are curving slightly, enough to see. what can i do about them? tom flynn, arlington    a. it would be difficult to take out the tongued-and-grooved boards and replace them because they are tongued and grooved, and also if they are old, you may not be able to find the right size to replace them with. so, sand the entire floor, including the cupped boards, in an attempt to sand down the high parts to be level with the low parts, and refinish. the boards cupped because they got wet and then dried out, so let's hope they are dry enough not to cup again.","or, instead of sanding, try this: put an area rug over the bad part, under table and chairs. there should be a rug under table and chairs anyway, to prevent inevitable scratching.  q. i am having my house vinyl sided. some people have said not to do it in cold weather because vinyl shrinks in the cold. is this so? how careful should i be concerning the cold weather? d.k., walpole a. vinyl, like all materials, will contract in cold weather and expand in warm weather. but you have to consider how cold it has to be for the shrinkage to be a factor. i don't think it is a problem, but to be safe i suggest that the work not be done below 40 degrees. vinyl siders often work through the winter (the off season) to keep busy.  q. i had new windows installed 10 years ago in an addition, and in the past year small panes are cracking in the 6 over 6 double-glazed windows; 4 out of 12 in one window. the windows are made by brosco, and a spokesman said that sometimes too much insulation is stuffed between the window frame and the rough opening, which makes the window too tight in the opening, causing cracks. what can i do? n.d., belmont a. it sounds weird, but it does happen. this is particularly so if the insulation is urethane foam, which expands a great deal when it is inserted. the solution is to take off the casing (frame) on the inside, and take out some or all of the insulation, then put in fiberglass but not too tight; just snug. the fiberglass does not expand like the foam does. and when you replace the cracked window, replace just the movable sash. brosco will have them. a better mousetrap build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door, goes the old saying. they also beat a path to my door when feeling weird in woburn wanted to know why mice were taking the peanut butter from the traps without getting clobbered. the handyman suggested putting a small square piece of cardboard on the trigger, then smearing on peanut butter. then more answers came, so here they are: steven in ipswich: try using a raisin. there is usually a little tab or hook on the trigger. it will hold the raisin securely (making sure the mouse must tug at it, setting off the trap). replace the raisin daily so there is always a fresh, moist raisin. martha breen of salem, n.h.: my husband puts a small amount (of peanut butter) on the trigger and makes sure some of it falls down over the edges, like a curl. often when mice lick the peanut butter the trigger is jogged and the trap launches. another thing: other mice will come and lick the remaining; peanut butter even though a fellow mouse has been whacked by the rap. once all the mice have been taken care of, the peanut butter will remain. this way we know when we have been victorious! pauline, via e-mail: the good old-fashioned wood mousetraps have been the best. i use a small piece of tootsie roll as bait wedged firmly on the hook. the mouse can't just lick it off, but has to tug. make sure the piece is small enough so the mouse has to get onto the trap to munch. presto - dead mouse! ernie of the us coast guard air station, cape cod: the secret is to make the mice have to work a little harder. i have succeeded by using a small slice of apple, and i suspect a piece of hard cheese would also work. most traps have a sort of hook where the bait goes. pry up the end of the hook a little, place the slice peel-side down, and impale it under the hook so it is secure. this also works very well with the larger rat traps. khurston ellia-epple: the mice in our house were equally tricky with peanut butter, but bacon got them every time. after we noticed mice tracks in the bacon drippings we'd left on the counter to get hard enough to throw away, we wedged a half-inch of cooked bacon into the food part of the trap. just cheap traps, too, nothing fancy. worked every time. now if i could just figure out how to get the cats to catch the mice instead. and finally, by e-mail: i mix cotton with the peanut butter, so when the mouse pulls on the mixture, it gets the works. has always worked. thanks to all, with the added warning to the mice: look out!  q. i don't know why, but the bright-white linoleum floor in my condo was stained yellow last summer. is there a solvent for it? what can i do? annoyed<    a. that stain is probably an antioxidant stain, and it is permanent. it only seems to happen with white sheet vinyl. manufacturers have formulated the vinyl to be stain resistant. certain antioxidant additives are formulated into rubber, which extend the life of the rubber and prevent brittleness, and which can discolor a vinyl floor when in contact with the vinyl. rubber items include mats, rubber-backed rugs, and rubber wheels on carts. there is one chance for redemption. if by any chance the stain was caused by tracking asphalt from the driveway, you can dissolve it with paint thinner and clean it up that way.  i think this is highly unlikely.  q. how can i remove the cigarette odor from a piece of furniture i brought into the house. only the furniture smells. smelly a. try spraying with febreze, an antiodor spray that can work. or wash all surfaces with a strong detergent and water, going very easy on the water. if the unit has upholstery, spray with febreze and be sure to spray the underside as well. if this does not work, clean the upholstery with a carpet soap or bar soap and scrub, with as little water as practicable.  handyman on call peter hotton is available 1 to 6 p.m. tuesdays to answer questions on house repair. call in your questions to 617-929-2930. hotton also chats online about house matters from 2 to 3 p.m. thursdays. to participate, go to boston.com. hotton's e-mail is photton@globe.com .   ",['ENGLISH'],1090,Copyright 2004 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '10', 'day': '21', 'year': '2004'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Admiralty & Maritime Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzRDNDVDOTdGRUQ1NDE1M0I1RjRBRDFBRTI3ODFGMDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"

""after much thought and prayer, i have come to my own personal conclusion that we shouldn't tell people who they can love or who they can marry.""","hagan last year opposed a state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, saying it could make it more difficult for companies to recruit talent. president obama announced his support for the unions the day after 61 percent of north carolina voters backed the gay-marriage amendment last may. the amendment reflected north carolina's urban-rural divide on social issues. the question passed in 92 of 100 counties, while the counties surrounding raleigh, chapel hill, durham, and charlotte were among those where the question was defeated. hagan became the 47th us senator to support gay marriage. forty-three other democrats, two independents who caucus with democrats, and one republican, senator rob portman of ohio, had previously announced their support. nine senate democrats oppose gay marriage, according to the human rights campaign, one of the largest gay rights organizations that tracks politicians' views. they are senator bob casey of pennsylvania, bill nelson of florida, joe manchin of west virginia, heidi heitkamp of north dakota, tom carper of delaware, mary landrieu of louisiana, tim johnson of south dakota, mark pryor of arkansas, and joe donnelly of indiana. no other republican in the senate besides portman publicly supports gay marriage. north carolina's senior senator, republican richard burr, declined to discuss his view during an interview wednesday other than to say he has ""personal opinions."" burr called marriage an issue for states to decide. ""i don't believe it's my role to influence the decisions that are made in north carolina that are not federal,"" burr said. burr said wednesday that he has been consistent on the issue, but was not a vocal public backer of last year's amendment. he co-sponsored a 2006 measure to amend the us constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. in 2011, burr criticized obama's announcement that the justice department would not defend the constitutionality of the defense of marriage act. ""traditional marriage is a core value that has strengthened our nation, and it is a value that is protected by federal law,"" burr said. hagan's position carries political risks. she was elected in 2008 on the day that obama won north carolina by just 14,000 votes, marking the first victory for a democratic presidential nominee since 1976. but north carolina was the only battleground state obama lost last year to mitt romney on the way to reelection. an election day exit poll conducted in november found that one-third of voters supported same-sex marriage. hagan believes religious institutions should not have to conduct same-sex marriages if that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. ""i think as a civil institution, this issue's time has come and we need to move forward,"" hagan said. ""the fabric of north carolina and what makes our state so special is our families and our common desire for a brighter future for our children. no matter what your family looks like, we all want the same thing for our families: happiness, health, prosperity, a bright future for our children."" associated press actress ashley judd won't challenge mcconnell frankfort, ky. — actress ashley judd announced wednesday that she will not run for us senate in kentucky against republican leader mitch mcconnell, saying she had given serious thought to a campaign but decided her responsibilities and energy need to be focused on her family. the former kentucky resident tweeted her decision. ""regretfully, i am currently unable to consider a campaign for the senate. i have spoken to so many kentuckians over these last few months who expressed their desire for a fighter for the people & new leader,"" judd wrote. ""while that won't be me at this time, i will continue to work as hard as i can to ensure the needs of kentucky families are met by returning this senate seat to whom it rightfully belongs: the people & their needs, dreams, and great potential. thanks for even considering me."" judd, 44, had hinted last week that she was near a decision about the race. now living in a suburb of nashville, judd had said little publicly about her intentions. associated press",['ENGLISH'],805,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-24f2dcc6-972e-11e2-95a7-5b792cdb6376,,,,The Boston

"Newspaper, Newspapers",EDITORIAL OPINION,Opinion,"Baker, Walsh, and DeLeo must move on climate change",,By Deb Pasternak,"arguably the most fundamental mission of government is to keep people safe. and on that metric, too many of our local elected officials are not taking the necessary steps to protect us. a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change concluded that if global warming is not limited to 1.5 degrees celsius by 2100, tens of millions of people will experience food insecurity, drought, disease, heat waves, wildfires, and extreme storms. here in the northeast, warming is occurring faster than the global average, resulting in heavier rainfalls. we can also expect to see more drought, hotter summers, and more frequent and extreme storms, as we saw last winter. governor charlie baker has claimed that climate change would be his top priority in the coming legislative session. yet the governor still supports imposing a $6 billion pipeline tax on ratepayers to pay for a massive new fracked-gas pipeline, which would increase our state's reliance on fossil fuels.","body boston mayor marty walsh claims to be a leader on climate change yet has dragged his feet on implementing community choice energy, which would boost the amount of renewable energy in boston's electricity contracts. the mayor has committed to reducing boston's carbon footprint 25 percent by 2020, yet boston's greenhouse gas emissions are rising, and the walsh administration is planning more than 70 million square feet of new buildings that will be powered by fracked gas. developers are subject to only a voluntary — not mandatory — climate resiliency checklist, and the mayor is still encouraging development in historic floodplains such as widett circle. house speaker robert deleo told a packed room at a boston college climate change symposium in june how shocked he was at the storms battling winthrop last winter, with flooding occurring where it never had before, yet the house he rules significantly weakened the clean energy bill passed by the massachusetts senate. two mit graduates were so fed up with the speaker's lack of leadership that they gathered enough signatures to place a nonbinding question on the ballot in winthrop and revere ordering the ""state rep. from this district"" to support creating a road map to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. the measure was passed by a majority of voters in deleo's district, with 73.4 percent voting yes and 26.6 percent voting no. the speaker's disinterest in climate change is all the more remarkable considering that winthrop, his hometown, is the most vulnerable community in the entire commonwealth to sea level rise. if baker wants to demonstrate he is serious about climate change, he will give up the ghost on new fracked-gas pipelines, and double down on renewable energy, which not only protects public health but creates good-paying local jobs, and keeps energy dollars here at home. if walsh wants to protect those who live and work in or visit boston, he should take aggressive action to wean the city off fossil fuels. and he should put in calls to deleo and every state representative who represents boston to demand they pass legislation that protects boston and the other 350 cities and towns in massachusetts. and we will see soon enough if deleo is ready to get serious about climate change by who he appoints to be the new ways and means chair. if he appoints someone who supports a clean energy mandate of 50 percent clean energy by 2030; removing caps on solar net metering that have caused solar jobs to decline over 20 percent within a year; and forcing gas companies to repair the thousands of dangerous and polluting gas leaks in virtually every community in the commonwealth, we will know that he understands the gravity of our situation and plans to make massachusetts a climate leader yet again. deb pasternak is interim chapter director of the massachusetts sierra club.",['ENGLISH'],650,Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-c8449e38-f96f-11e8-9cae-db76ec84a7fe,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '10', 'month': '12', 'year': '2018'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000310', 'className': 'CLIMATE CHANGE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X84', 'className': 'US STATE GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000526', 'className': 'DROUGHT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZAI', 'className': 'ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000594', 'className': 'EMISSIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D8B1', 'className': 'GREENHOUSE GASES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001198', 'className': 'NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DL4P', 'className': 'OIL & GAS FACILITIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N486000CC', 'className': 'PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001466', 'className': 'ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZGJ', 'className': 'ELECTORAL DISTRICTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000796', 'className': 'GLOBAL WARMING'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DF9I', 'className': 'HEAT WAVES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000365', 'className': 'CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DEWJ', 'className': 'EXTREME TEMPERATURES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000775', 'className': 'NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8D', 'className': 'ENERGY REGULATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000D0FD', 'className': 'FOOD SECURITY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001880', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D5BM', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001906', 'className': 'FLOOD ZONES'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX000160', 'className': 'BALLOTS'}, {'score': '51', 'classCode': 'STX000566', 'className': 'ELECTRICITY MARKETS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DHHB', 'className': 'CHARLIE BAKER'}]}"

""people i have a great deal of respect for have asked me to look at the race,"" leone said. ""i will give it serious consideration, but my intention, as i announced last month, has always been to leave electoral politics.""","leone, a former federal and state prosecutor who handled several high-profile cases prior to becoming district attorney, announced last month that he would not seek a third term as district attorney in the 2014 elections and had decided to leave public service. ""i am not running for another elective office,"" leone said at the time. ""in fact, i intend to leave government service when i leave this office."" leone's entry into what many thought would be a two-candidate race would spark a major shift in the campaign, crowding the democratic field. but leone's roots in middlesex county could be a significant factor in his favor. the sprawling region stretches from the eastern merrimack valley and new hampshire border towns to cambridge and somerville, and west to newton and framingham. leone, who easily won election in 2006 and reelection in 2010, is well known in the county, which could help him win support. about a third of those who are expected to vote in the democratic primary live in middlesex county. in his career, the hopkinton democrat prosecuted some of the most memorable cases in state history, including those of attempted shoe bomber richard reid and british au pair louise woodward, who after her trial and appeal was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a child in her care. with markey and lynch's campaign operations already established, leone will face heavy pressure to make up his mind in the next few days. he must collect 10,000 certified voter signatures over the next four weeks to qualify for the primary ballot. john walsh, chairman of the state democratic party, said saturday that he had not spoken to leone about a potential run. ""i have not talked to gerry,"" he said. ""he's obviously a very talented and respected person."" walsh and the party have not endorsed any democrat, but the democratic senatorial campaign committee and senior party figures including victoria kennedy, the widow of senator edward m. kennedy; former us senator john f. kerry; state treasurer steve grossman; and attorney general martha coakley have endorsed him. walsh said the party would welcome more candidates into the democratic primary. ""i actually like competition, and i think the primaries are helpful for us,"" walsh said. conor yunits, a lynch spokesman, said his campaign would also embrace leone as a primary candidate. a markey spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment saturday. scott brown's decision on friday not to run again left the republican party scrambling for a potential replacement. former state senate minority leader richard r. tisei took his name out of contention saturday when he announced that he does not plan on running.

,LIVING; Pg. E3,,Choices shrink for jazz fans with format change at WSJZ;,,," the erosion began earlier this year, when plymouth's wplm-fm (99.1) switched its all-day soft jazz format to easy-listening, a move that station management told the globe in february was due partly to competition from wsjz. but despite winning that battle, greater media inc., which owns wsjz, is abandoning the format that the station has played (originally as woaz) since december 1995.","  although purists often argued that the ""smooth jazz"" of wsjz-fm (96.9) should not be called jazz at all, there can be no denying that when the station completes its format change next month, local jazz-radio fans will be the losers. with the switch from music to talk, begun on monday when reruns of don imus's syndicated show took over the morning drive time, boston has lost its last full-time commercial jazz station. true, jazz-radio fans can still find their music, but only on ""destination"" shows, that is, specific programs. commercial programs like ""the jazz brunch"" (sundays, 6 a.m.-2 p.m.) on wfnx-fm (101.7) and ""sunday morning jazz"" (8 a.m.-noon) on wmjx-fm (106.7) give the music regular, if limited airings on the alternative-rock and adult-pop stations. among noncommercial stations, the music also has its niches. there have been longstanding public-radio shows, such as eric jackson's ""eric in the evening"" on wgbh-fm (89.7), monday-thursday, 7 p.m.-midnight. such programs join the offerings on college stations, like the ones mit's wmbr-fm (88.1) broadcasts mondays through thursdays, 4-6 p.m., and the straight-ahead ""jazz oasis"" monday-friday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m., and sunday's avant-garde ""alternate takes,"" 5-7 p.m., on emerson's wers-fm (88.9). these shows, say longtime jazz djs, continue to draw listeners to their odd hours, largely because they program a wider range of music than was ever heard on either of the smooth stations.  ""the problem with smooth jazz stations,"" says jeff turton, host of ""the jazz brunch"" for 16 years, ""is they were so overconsulted and so consultant driven.""  ""they've tied our hands a little bit with consultants,"" acknowledges jackie brush, the afternoon dj of wsjz who will continue to host 'mjx's sunday morning show, as she has for more than five years.  ""here's an audience that while not necessarily a straight-ahead [ jazz] or deeply knowledgeable audience is still an audience that enjoys instrumental music,"" turton continues. ""i don't think they gave the audience credit for enough intelligence. they could have done better, quicker by pushing the audience a little harder.""  could the commercial stations have taken that risk? clearly, turton's show is surviving, as is brush's program on wmjx (a sister greater media station to wsjz). but these are only small bits of each station's programming. which raises the question of whether the boston area commercial airwaves are simply not ripe for full-time jazz.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,Study: Mixing serums gives strong protection,,,"a health worker took a sample from a woman in her car at a testing station to test for covid-19 in nelson bay, australia, as authorities struggled on monday to contain several clusters of the coronavirus, mostly in urban areas, around the country. early results from a british vaccine study suggest that mixing different brands of vaccines can provoke a protective immune response against covid-19. in the trial, volunteers produced high levels of antibodies and immune cells after getting one dose of the pfizer-biontech vaccine and one dose of the astrazeneca-oxford shot.","body administering the vaccines in either order is likely to provide potent protection, matthew snape, a vaccine specialist at the university of oxford, said at a news conference monday. snape and his colleagues began the trial, called com-cov, in february. in the first wave of the study, they gave 830 volunteers one of four combinations of vaccines. some got two doses of either pfizer or astrazeneca, both of which have been shown to be effective against covid. others got a dose of one vaccine, followed by a dose of the other. for the first wave of volunteers, the researchers waited four weeks between doses. studies have found the astrazeneca vaccine provides stronger protection if the second dose is delayed up to 12 weeks, so the researchers are also running a separate 12-week trial which should deliver results next month. the researchers found that volunteers reported more chills, headaches, and muscle pain than people who get two doses of the same vaccine. snape and his colleagues then drew blood to measure the immune response in the volunteers. they found that those who got two doses of pfizer-biontech produced levels of antibodies about 10 times as high as those who got two doses of astrazeneca. volunteers who got pfizer followed by astrazeneca showed antibody levels about five times as high as those with two doses of astrazeneca. and volunteers who got astrazeneca followed by pfizer reached antibody levels about as high as those who got doses of pfizer. he said the differences would most likely narrow in the volunteers who get a second dose after 12 weeks, when the astrazeneca vaccine has had more time to strengthen its effects. the study also found that using different vaccines produced a higher level of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus than did giving two doses of the same vaccine. snape said it wasn't clear yet why mixing had that advantage. new york times 3rd astrazeneca dose boosts immune response a third dose of the vaccine developed by astrazeneca and the university of oxford generated a strong immune response in clinical trial volunteers, oxford researchers said monday. the finding indicates that the astrazeneca vaccine could be an option should third shots end up being needed, for example, to extend immunity. to date, the vaccine has been given as two doses, typically between 4 and 12 weeks apart. the new data, detailed in a preprint manuscript, came from 90 study volunteers in britain who were among the earliest to receive the shots in a clinical trial last year. in march, they were given a third dose, roughly 30 weeks after their second. laboratory analyses showed that the third dose increased levels of antibodies to the virus in the volunteers to a point higher than seen a month after their second dose — an encouraging sign that the third shot would be likely to bring greater protection if the effectiveness of two doses waned over time. new york times worried about delta, who urges vaccinated to mask world health organization officials, concerned about the easing of precautions meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus even as the most contagious variant to date has emerged, have urged even fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and to keep taking other measures to prevent infection. the centers for disease control and prevention, on the other hand, told fully vaccinated americans in may that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or to maintain a distance of 6 feet from other people. the agency also eased advice about testing and quarantine after suspected exposure to the virus. asked on monday about the new cautions expressed by the who — the world's largest public health organization — a cdc spokesperson pointed to the existing guidance and gave no indication it would change. dr. mariângela simão, the who's assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals, said that even vaccinated people should continue to consistently wear masks, avoid crowds, and maintain social distance from others, make sure they are in well-ventilated spaces, wash their hands frequently, and avoid sneezing or coughing around other people.

,METRO/REGION; Pg. 21,,Statue of limitations,,,"the lynn police department is in disarray, and it all started with a plastic, six-inch statue of the virgin mary. nothing personal against the virgin mary. it's just that lt. eugene begley got tired of looking at the statue that sat in a crowded, four-desk office night after night in the lynn police department. he got tired of the owner's self-righteous attitude toward him and other police officers.","whenever a police officer would swear - an occupational requirement - capt. bruce hogan, who owned the statue, would thrust it in the miscreant's face and tell them the poor virgin was blushing, begley said. ""once, a police officer said a swear word and hogan grabbed the statue, ran over to her face and said, 'she's blushing, garbage-mouth! she's blushing!' my officers asked me to do something about it,"" begley said. so he did. he began removing the statue, or covering it with newspapers. hogan ordered begley not to touch it. so begley didn't. when hogan went to supper, begley placed a cup over it. the next day, begley, who has been a lynn police officer for 30 years, was transferred to a desk job on the day shift, the equivalent of siberia to a street cop. not to mention the fact that the transfer is costing begley $ 1,000 a week in private detail work. begley, who is catholic himself and says he has a crucifix hanging on his bedroom wall, believes his rights have been violated - first by the presence of the statue, then by his transfer. but that was just the beginning. he has been suspended twice since then, amid charges that he conducted an unauthorized investigation of hogan's son, who was convicted in a hit-and-run accident. the first suspension came after begley supposedly leaked his report of the incident to the press. when he was hit with that five-day suspension, he initially refused to give up his service revolver. so he was suspended again. but back to the virgin mary. some of the police officers felt the way hogan used it was ""sacrilegious,"" begley said. others felt intimidated because hogan was their commander. as for begley, he feels there was a separation of church and state issue. ""i believe in a public building he has no right to impose his religion on other people. it's not his private office."" the irony is, two of the detectives in the office that begley has been reassigned to have virgin mary statues on their desks. ""but they just sit there passively,"" begley noted. ""one man hangs his keys on it. they're not imposing them on others."" ""i'm baptized a catholic,"" begley added. ""i hold the virgin mary in reverence. it's hogan's abuse of that statue i object to."" during an interview, begley's attorney, nancy merrick, was at his side, mostly to make sure he didn't say outrageous things. but it didn't always work. at one point, he likened a superior officer to ""the ayatollah"" and said: ""i have a retired cop friend who calls the police department the house of hate. i call it the house of sleaze. the way to get along there is to be devious, dishonorable, a liar, cheat and vindictive."" now, the lynn police department is not exactly a stranger to controversy. five years ago, two officers were fired after they admitted to having sex on a barroom floor with a woman who charged that they had drugged and raped her. nearly three years ago, two more cops were fired after they allegedly refused to respond to a crime in progress during their dinner break. according to a story in the daily evening item: ""two lynn patrolmen couldn't tear themselves away from onion rings to help a merchant catch a thief."" the police brass aren't commenting on the begley affair, saying that it is a management-labor dispute in arbitration, and hogan was not available for comment. next week, the case goes before a city hearing officer. meanwhile, begley is tied to a day desk job. ""i'm very bored,"" he said. ""we do more on a friday night than swampscott and marblehead do all year. assaults, rapes, breaking-and-entering, that's the lifeblood of police work."" his other lifeblood, he is quick to tell you, is money. last year, he was the highest paid cop, earning $ 82,000 with his salary and detail work. ""i just want to go back to my night job and do my paid detail during the day,"" begley said. ""i want to get a new boat. i have one that sleeps four, i want one that sleeps six. in a couple of years, i want to go where it's warm and sunny. i don't want to spend my final days in lynn."" that reminded me of an old saying: ""lynn, lynn, city of sin. you never go out the way you went in.""

"Newspaper, Newspapers",REGIONAL,South,Interest in dairy site for farming,Solar energy another possibility,,"abington - a parcel of much-debated, but underused, farmland that the town of abington purchased for $750,000 in 1998 may be partially returned to its original use, according to town manager john d'agostino. john hornstra, owner of hingham-based hornstra's farm dairy, has contacted d'agostino about leasing a portion of the 64-acre property still known as griffin's dairy. hornstra would use the land off plymouth street to grow crops for his cows, and would possibly restore its dilapidated structures. much of the acreage is wooded, according to d'agostino, and it isn't clear how much of it is usable. ideally, d'agostino said, he would like to see both a solar-panel array and hornstra's agricultural operation on the site.","``i think that the town realizes the property is an asset, and using it for its original purpose would be good,'' hornstra said. though state department of agricultural resources figures show the number of dairy farms across massachusetts has declined from 6,760 in 1950 to 161 today, hornstra said he is capitalizing on the current interest in buying local products. ``i'm probably the only person in the world starting a dairy farm now,'' said hornstra, a hingham resident who purchased a historic farm property on prospect street in norwell for more than $1 million in 2009. by this summer, hornstra said, he expects the norwell operation to produce about 500 gallons of milk daily to help fill the orders of customers in 15 area communities who receive home delivery of dairy products from his company. the new supply should help reduce the number of 350-mile round trips, and the carbon footprint, of the tractor-trailers delivering milk from his cousin's farm in north haverhill, n.h. the company's bottles contain milk from the new hampshire farm, while farmer-friends ``cow-sit'' hornstra's 30 cows in duxbury, middleborough, and dracut and sell the milk to the agri-mark inc. cooperative in lawrence. hornstra is a fourth-generation farmer whose family once owned 100 acres and 85 cows on union street in hingham until they sold it to condominium developers in the early 1980s. he has been looking for ways to expand the family's agricultural legacy ever since, he said. the norwell property was repaired with the help of an amish family from pennsylvania who specialize in restoring agricultural buildings. in abington, d'agostino said, there are buildings on the griffin's dairy property that could use restoration, and he's interested in the possibility of a farming operation that would serve local consumers. hornstra and the town have not negotiated the details of any arrangement. before he makes any investment in returning the land to a dairy operation, hornstra said, he needs to know whether a longer-term lease would be available. hornstra said he hopes to walk the property with d'agostino when the weather improves. that's something selectmen have been doing for the past few months, at the invitation of neighbors and jim dombrowski, founder of the save griffin's dairy group. dombrowski, who once worked as a conservation officer in holbrook, and had served on the griffin's dairy study committee appointed by abington selectmen, brought attention to the property's undecided future by relaunching a website, www.griffinsdairy.farming.officelive.com. dombrowski contends that the acreage is largely unbuildable wetland, and that a 2005 finding by the town's conservation commission that would have permitted the building of a middle school on the site was done when mowing and the june sun had removed evidence of wetland plants and seepage. dombrowski also said that all suggestions put to selectmen during his five years with the study committee, including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee the griffin property, were turned down by selectmen. among the ideas were a visitor-friendly farm, and a veterinary facility for large animals. the board's current members are willing to work with dombrowski, according to its chairman. ``jim dombrowski is very passionate about griffin's dairy and environmental concerns; he's done a lot of work, and we want to make it right,'' said selectman michael franey. he added that he has received a copy of the study committee's suggestions and will examine them. selectmen also have sought the town counsel's advice on what can be done with the land, and ``whatever that is, we will have to go to town meeting and abide by zoning laws and regulations,'' franey added. in a jan. 4 letter addressed to d'agostino, a lawyer for the town, shirin everett, focused on the proposal for power-generating solar panels. everett noted that special town meeting voters had approved acquiring the griffin property, at 363 plymouth st., for ``public purposes including open space and recreation,'' and not necessarily agriculture. everett also stated that the phrase ``public purposes'' has been interpreted to include open space, public parking, and schools. ``in my opinion, a court would likely find that since solar energy promotes a cleaner environment, use of the property for renewable energy benefits the public and constitutes a public purpose,'' she wrote. according to bob ritchie, general counsel for the department of agricultural resources, there is no particular purpose that the town is constrained to review. ``public purposes is a very broad category,'' he said. d'agostino has been studying the solar panel option, which he said could save the town $2.5 million in annual energy costs after it completes a 20-year rent-to-buy plan that would finance the project. the solar farm would require a majority vote at town meeting, according to everett. d'agostino said he isn't sure that the town can do both solar panels and farming, but the two options must be considered. ``we're looking at as many options as possible, and that's our responsibility, to consider everything seriously.'' constance lindner can be reached at cl0734@gmail.com",['ENGLISH'],987,Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-GB61NGKF9.1,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '27', 'month': '01', 'year': '2011'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Tax Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001454', 'className': 'REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Local Governments'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000D5BM', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N112120MM', 'className': 'DAIRY FARMING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009F8J', 'className': 'FAMILY FARMS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00097FC', 'className': 'MILK'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000364', 'className': 'RESIDENTIAL CO-OWNERSHIP'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001903', 'className': 'FOOD INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00096KL', 'className': 'RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUMzQTI2Qzg3NkJDNDI5MEI1MTU1QkM0RDlGN0JENUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjQxMkNBNkE1ODE5NDg0NUJDMTkzNzA1NTMwQzRFQ0M', 'className': 'Condominiums'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001454', 'className': 'REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000441', 'className': 'DAIRY PRODUCTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDlCOTMzNzhGREJBNDJENEEyM0ZGMjVFODI5Nzc4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA', 'className': 'Solar Power Industry'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS145', 'className': 'NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS154', 'className': 'PENNSYLVANIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"

""computers. screens. bleeps and buttons. processors. every day more . . . bank cards, phone cards. software. discs. jvc, vcr, abc, def. i can't work any of it! i am the foreigner."" to a less extreme degree, most of us experience alienation in the world. but what's remarkable is how easily people can feel dumb in their own homes, surrounded by domestic mysteries, poring over instruction pamphlets to learn ways of doing things we aren't sure we want to do. i suppose i could master these booklets of technical instructions that fill my library, hire a teacher and take a course in modern household 101, winter semester. i could learn to spread sheets and time coffee and communicate with my modem. but if everyday life has become far too complicated, learning to ""function"" up to the standards of its tools and timetables is not my idea of simplifying. at the risk of disappointing machines and the expectations of their creators, i have adopted, willy-nilly, a sort of passive resistance. some machines i use minimally, storing its other ""functions"" like yogurt-makers of christmas past. others i seem to go on failing to learn. if that means there is a dusty computer on the third floor - well, ours is not the only house haunted by modern technology.",['ENGLISH'],663,Copyright 1988 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '12', 'day': '27', 'year': '1988'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000CEAQ', 'className': 'ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009Y72', 'className': 'CHRISTMAS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0009U6N', 'className': 'POP & ROCK'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000523', 'className': 'DOGS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000024', 'className': 'CONTINUING EDUCATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST0008YT5', 'className': 'COMPUTER CHIPS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001704', 'className': 'TELEVISION PROGRAMMING'}], 'city': [{'score': '50', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}]}"
,METRO/REGION; Pg. 41,,Funds OK'd for prison alternatives;,,,"racing to wrap up business before this year's session ends tomorrow, the house yesterday approved funding to create alternative sanctions programs for non-violent offenders, hire more state social workers and clear a backlog of cases involving special needs children awaiting adoption.  the alternative sanctions program, for which the house voted $ 11 million, would seek to rehabilitate offenders without incarceration - thus helping to relieve prison overcrowding. the vote would create alternative sanctions programs in suffolk, norfolk, hampden, briston and worcester counties.","""we can't build our way out of the problem and we can't punish our way out of the problem,"" said house speaker charles f. flaherty (d-cambridge), who championed the alternative sanctions idea.  rep. emanuel g. serra (d-east boston), who chaired a sentencing study committee appointed by flaherty, said it costs the state $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate, compared to about $ 6,000 a year for alternatives such as house arrest, electronic monitoring, community service or rehabilitation programs.  serra said statistics show that the recidivism rate is more than double among inmates who are released to the community directly from prison, compared to those who attend community corrections programs.  flaherty formed the study in response to a september globe spotlight team report which revealed that big-time drug dealers often bargain their way out of mandatory sentences by forfeiting drug profits, while first-time offenders are often given longer terms.  as part of a prison construction bond bill, the house is expected to vote today on another proposal from serra's committee that would give judges greater leeway to vary so-called mandatory sentences, providing they document why.  in a move to bolster the beleaguered department of social services, the house voted $ 4.9 million to hire additional social workers.  house ways and means chairman thomas m. finneran (d-mattapan) said the money will be earmarked for social workers to reduce caseloads.  gov. weld asked for $ 5.1 million in september to hire more than 100 new case workers, and an additional $ 8.8 million last month to help overburdened foster parents and provide more alternatives to traditional foster care.  yesterday the house voted to approve an additional $ 1 million to speed up the adoptions of special needs children who have languished in state care because of a lack of funding to process their cases.  another house vote would make it easier for the registry of motor vehicles to handle the unexpected costs of the ""sick building"" problems in its boston headquarters.",['ENGLISH'],447,Copyright 1995 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,"During Boston visit, Sessions stands up for Rosenstein",Supports deputy amid calls for his impeachment,,"attorney general jeff sessions on thursday threw his support behind deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, who was recently targeted by conservative republicans in congress who have moved to impeach him over his handling of the russia investigation.","body ""rod rosenstein is highly capable. . . . i have the highest confidence in him,"" sessions said in boston, where he participated in a news conference announcing a crackdown on undocumented immigrants collecting federal services. a republican and former us senator, sessions urged the republican-controlled congress to turn its attention away from attacking rosenstein and the justice department and instead pay attention to more significant national concerns. he said lawmakers should focus on closing loopholes in the country's immigration laws instead. ""that's where i'd like their focus to be,"" sessions said. his comments came shortly before house speaker paul ryan said at a news conference in washington, d.c., that he does not support the effort to impeach rosenstein. ""i don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term,"" ryan said. ryan made the comments a day after the group of house republicans filed articles of impeachment against rosenstein, following months of criticism aimed at the justice department — and the russia investigation in particular — from president trump and his gop allies in congress. the five impeachment articles would charge rosenstein with ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" for failing to produce information to congressional committees and signing off on what some republicans say was improper surveillance of a trump adviser. back in boston on thursday, sessions also commented on a speech he gave tuesday to conservative high school students, where he repeated the phrase ""lock her up,"" a chant that trump's supporters used during the 2016 campaign to call for jailing democrat hillary clinton, who was running against the republican trump. ""i met with a group of enthusiastic high school students and they spontaneously broke [into chants]. perhaps i should have taken a moment to remind them of the fact that people are presumed innocent until cases are made,"" he said. conservative hard-liners agreed to hold off on pushing for an impeachment vote on thursday after securing a commitment from gop leaders to punish justice department officials with a contempt of congress if they do not deliver specified documents in the coming weeks. the deal essentially puts off the showdown until after lawmakers return from a five-week recess set to begin after thursday's votes. the 11 republicans, led by representatives mark meadows of north carolina, and jim jordan of ohio, filed their resolution to impeach rosenstein late wednesday in a direct attack on a trump administration law enforcement official. the justice department insists that it has cooperated with the demands from congress. officials have said that they have provided the vast majority of information sought in subpoenas from two key house committees — and are nearly done with providing all the outstanding information requested in those subpoenas. material from the washington post was used in this report. maria cramer can be reached at mcramer@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],552,Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5c3be75e-90e3-11e8-9833-430d2273778a,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '27', 'month': '07', 'year': '2018'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000128', 'className': 'ATTORNEYS GENERAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001640', 'className': 'SUBPOENAS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DA1D', 'className': 'US CONGRESS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Immigration'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000887', 'className': 'IMMIGRATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DKTF', 'className': 'SURVEILLANCE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000884', 'className': 'ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUI1ODc0MDYwNjA2NDI4QUI0QjQ4NTQyMkVEQTI1RTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM0OEVFRDFGOUFCNEUzMkFDQjk5OTE5QUE2MzJBRjg', 'className': 'Misdemeanors'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000A27D', 'className': 'PAUL RYAN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UU7', 'className': 'JEFF SESSIONS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJO', 'className': 'HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE000A20F', 'className': 'JIM JORDAN'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS149', 'className': 'NORTH CAROLINA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS124', 'className': 'DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",METRO,,Capuano files bill to require tunnel checks every 2 years,,Sean P. Murphy and Scott Allen GLOBE STAFF,"upset that the big dig tunnel in which a ceiling collapsed had never been inspected, us representative michael e. capuano filed a bill in congress yesterday to mandate detailed inspections of all tunnels at least every two years.","capuano, a democrat from somerville who sits on the house transportation committee, said last night that he filed the bill in reaction to the july 10 ceiling collapse that took the life of milena del valle of jamaica plain. investigators quickly determined that the ceiling came down when a handful of bolts used to suspend it from the roof gave out. if inspectors had gone into the 5-foot-high crawl space above the suspended ceiling after the tunnel opened, they probably would have noticed bolts pulled out, perhaps alerting them to the danger of collapse, investigators have said. ""clearly, more must be done to ensure the safety of the traveling public,"" capuano said. ""apparently, if inspections are not required, they won't be done. this bill would require those inspections."" capuano's bill is modeled on the federal bridge program, which mandates inspections of bridges at least every two years. ""the bridge program means that when you drive over a bridge you know it's been inspected,"" he said. in the absence of a federal inspection program for tunnels, the massachusetts turnpike authority, which oversees the big dig, set its own inspection schedule. in the case of the interstate 90 connector tunnel where the collapse occurred, the turnpike had last inspected the ceiling in 2000, when it was built. the connector opened for traffic in 2003. but while state officials conducted a preopening safety check of the roadway surface and walls, no one got into the crawl space to view the hanger assembly that included the bolts. turnpike authority officials said after the collapse that they had been planning to inspect the connector later that summer, to fulfill legal obligations the authority assumed when selling billions of dollars in bonds to investors. turnpike officials interpreted their agreement with bondholders to mean that no inspection of the connector was required in 2003, its first year of use, when older sections of the big dig were inspected. after the ceiling collapse, investigators found 225 ceiling bolts in the connector that had pulled out of the roof at least a fraction of an inch, in addition to the 20 that had ripped out to cause the collapse. work crews have since abandoned the hanger assembly system that relied on epoxy to hold the bolts in holes drilled into the concrete roof. the new assembly system locks the bolts into place using grooves cut into the roof. also, officials have greatly increased the number of bolts carrying the weight of the concrete ceiling. capuano said he expected little opposition to the bill. he said the chairman of the transportation committee, james l. oberstar of minnesota, a democrat, had assured him of swift action.",['ENGLISH'],486,Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-5658661,,,FIRST EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '11', 'month': '01', 'year': '2007'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"

""you don't replace a kid like joe clancy,"" said curran, whose squad will kick off their season saturday at bryant, a former northeast-10 rival now competing at the fcs level. ""i don't think of him as just the best in merrimack college history, but as the best in the history of this conference. the kid took it to another level."" clancy, a two-time northeast-10 offensive player of the year, piloted the warriors to a 7-4 mark last season. his numbers were staggering: 48 touchdown passes and 4,116 yards. but there is life after joe clancy, one that curran hopes will continue to feature an uber-productive offense, albeit one that may rely a little more on a defense that came on strong late last year. a unit that has has continued to improve during fall camp. ""in the spring and in preseason, the story has been the defense and that's good,"" curran said. ""it's pushed us. at merrimack, we've been known for our offense, which is great, and we're not going to shy away from throwing the ball around and trying to score tons of points. but the defense has really come on and is doing some good things with its schemes, the xs and os, and has some really good players."" senior linemen justin hood of billerica and chris unis of gloucester, both co-captains, are key players on defense, along with sophomore defensive lineman josh hill, sophomore linebacker c arey wells-jowers and senior defensive back ervin johnson. on offense, there are still plenty of playmakers, punctuated by junior receiver jere brown, who had a breakout season with 86 catches, 1,186 yards, and 17 touchdowns. it will be the job of bakanowsky and the other quarterbacks to get the ball to brown, along with backs armond mcrae, a driell mayes, mance walls, and derrick villard. barankowsky had the edge in camp with his knowledge of, and experience in, curran's offensive system. laspada landed on the merrimack campus, roughly 20 minutes from his billerica home, in a roundabout way, via connecticut and maine. he was on a path to harvard until blood clots forced him to the sideline for his final two games of his senior season at billerica high. during his recovery, he was sidelined for six months. ""at that time we were taking it day by day, and i wanted to be healthy before i started worrying about other things,"" la-spada said. ""that was the no. 1 priority. there was a lot going on at the time."" recruiters shied away. he enrolled at the taft school in watertown, conn., where he played safety. bates then recruited him and asked him to start throwing again. he was a backup last season for a bobcats team that threw the ball a limited number of times. as his health continued to improve, he got the urge to play at a higher level in a wide-open offense, and he approached merrimack this summer. bringing laspada in, whether he plays quarterback early or late, plays some special teams or switches to another position, was an easy decision, according to curran. ""he's got some things you just can't teach,"" the coach said. ""his compete level, his leadership skills. the kid's special. and he's real tough."" here and there joe clancy has had quite an introduction to football in sweden. he signed with the orebro black knights about a month ago as an injury replacement to serve out the rest of the season, which runs from may through september. in his first game against the arlanda jets on aug. 16, clancy completed 17 of 29 passes for 414 yards and 10 touchdowns in a 78-14 win. with 341 yards passing and two tds, he and the rest of the black knights came back to earth in their next gamed, a 48-20 loss to carlstad . . . the umass-lowell field hockey team was picked fifth out of six teams in the america east preseason coaches' poll. albany was the top choice, followed by new hampshire, maine, fairfield, lowell, and vermont. the river hawks went 2-16 overall and 1-4 in the league last year in their first year moving up to division 1 from division 2. lowell won division 2 national titles in 2005 and 2010 . . . . marten vandervelde, a strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater, tufts university, has written ""beneath the college jersey: the athlete's guide to healthier nutrition, habits, and recovery methods.""

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Look to the Patriots for scouting expertise,,,"with the national football league's draft ­approaching next month, you can bet that every team has carefully constructed its list of the most promising college players they hope to add to their rosters. what if massachusetts devoted the same resources to scouting the next generation of entrepreneurs as nfl teams devote to finding their next great wide receiver? (the patriots alone have 21 employees focused solely on identifying and cultivating future players.) entrepreneurs, after all, can have a far bigger impact on the local economy than football stars, no matter how many seats they fill or jerseys they sell. i've been brainstorming lately about how a scouting program might operate, soliciting input from entrepreneurs who got their educations here, as well as start-up coaches like katie rae of techstars boston and jeffrey bussgang of flybridge capital partners. here's how we might identify high-potential future founders, and also what we'd do once we identified them.","let's start with picking 10 massachusetts trade groups who believe their mission should include planting seeds for the future of their industries: groups like the retailers association of massachusetts, new england clean energy council, and massachusetts digital games institute. ask each group to identify five massachusetts students each year who have shown a spark of entrepreneurial potential. that gives you 50 students a year. source another 50 by soliciting nominations from professors, student entrepreneurship clubs, and investors who spend time on college campuses already. put those students into a database, and send each one a nice fleece with the logo of the new massachusetts founders league embroidered on the back. the mfl would enable students to connect with one another. it would help them meet successful massachusetts entrepreneurs and investors who might provide seed funding for their ideas. it would try to open doors in all sorts of ways, from finding free, short-term office space to getting pro bono legal advice to ironing out visa issues for foreign students. mfl members would be chosen at the start of each calendar year (giving all the nominators the first three or four months of the school year to do their scouting), and they'd be welcomed into the group with a state house reception hosted by governor deval patrick. other events throughout the year might feature well-known entrepreneurs sitting down to share experiences: people like constant contact founder gail goodman, staples founder tom stemberg, or restaurateur barbara lynch. venture capitalists and angel investors could sponsor bowling nights to get to know the group. members would get free admission to any seminar or conference planned by the 10 trade groups making nominations for the mfl. over the summers, group members might have an ­opportunity to ""shadow"" local founders, ­assisting them in exchange for office space and time to develop their own start-up ideas. as long as mfl members remained enrolled as students, and for one year afterward, they'd be invited to attend mfl events; after that, they would go ""emeritus,"" but still have access to a network that provided assistance and connections. who would coordinate all this? one idea is to have the 10 trade groups dedicate one staffer's time on a rotating basis. i expect you could run the mfl with one staffer dedicating one day a week to maintaining the member database and planning events. at the end of a year, the responsibility would shift to the next group. there are several great initiatives that already exist in this vein, but nothing that works as a comprehensive, statewide scouting system. the cambridge venture capital firm flagship ventures runs a summer ""fellows program"" for entrepreneurially oriented scientists and engineers, inviting them to help transform laboratory insights into real companies. flybridge runs a program called stay in ma that offers college students ""scholarships"" to local workshops and conferences that cost $100 or less. one of the initiatives that has had the biggest impact is the summer@highland program, run by the cambridge venture capital firm highland capital partners. it invites collegiate entrepreneurs to apply for a 10-week program that offers office space, an $18,000 stipend, and access to a network of mentors. the babson college-educated founders of gemvara, who were planning a move to los angeles, participated in 2008; the online jewelry site they created now employs 80 people, most of them in boston. two boston university undergraduates founded bytelight, a 2011 participant, which is designing an led light bulb that can transmit data to mobile phones (directions to finding a product in a large store, for example). so far, bytelight's founders have raised $1.25 million and brought on five full-time employees.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Federal buyers often blind to factory woes,Best price is usually the primary goal when US orders garments from abroad,,"washington — the us government, one of the world's biggest clothing buyers, spends more than $1.5 billion a year at factories overseas, acquiring everything from the royal blue shirts worn by airport security workers to the olive button-downs required for forest rangers and the camouflage pants sold to troops on military bases. but though the obama administration has called on western buyers to use their purchasing power to push for improved working conditions after several workplace disasters during the last 14 months, the us government has done little to adjust its own shopping habits.","body labor department officials say federal agencies have a ""zero-tolerance"" policy on using overseas plants that break local laws, but american government suppliers in countries including bangladesh, the dominican republic, haiti, mexico, pakistan, and vietnam show a pattern of legal violations and harsh working conditions, according to audits and interviews at factories. among them: padlocked fire exits, buildings at risk of collapse, falsified wage records, and repeated hand punctures from sewing needles when workers were pushed to hurry. in bangladesh, shirts with marine corps logos sold in military stores were made at dk knitwear, where child laborers made up a third of the workforce, according to a 2010 audit that led some vendors to cut ties with the plant. managers punched workers for missed production quotas, and the plant had no functioning alarm system despite previous fires, auditors said. many of the problems remain, according to another audit this year and recent interviews with workers. in chiang mai, thailand, employees at the georgie & lou factory, which makes clothing sold by the smithsonian institution, said they were illegally docked more than 5 percent of their roughly $10-per-day wage for any clothing item with a mistake. they also described physical harassment by factory managers and cameras monitoring workers in bathrooms. federal agencies rarely know what factories make their clothes, much less require audits of them, according to interviews with procurement officials and industry experts. the agencies, they added, exert less oversight of foreign suppliers than many retailers do. and there is no law prohibiting the federal government from buying clothes produced overseas under unsafe or abusive conditions. ""it doesn't exist for the exact same reason that american consumers still buy from sweatshops,"" said daniel gordon, a former top federal procurement official. ""the government cares most about getting the best price."" frank benenati, a spokesman for the office of management and budget, said the administration has made progress in improving oversight, including an executive order last year tightening rules against federal suppliers using factories that rely on debt bondage or other forms of forced labor. ""the administration is committed to ensuring that our government is doing business only with contractors who place a premium on integrity and good business ethics,"" he said. federal spending on garments overseas does not reach that of walmart, which spends more than $1 billion a year just in bangladesh, or zara, the spanish apparel seller, but it is in a top tier that includes h&m, eddie bauer, and lands' end. us agencies typically do not order clothes directly from factories. they rely on contractors. this makes it challenging for agencies to track their global supply chain, with layers of middlemen, lax oversight by other governments, few of their own inspectors overseas, and little means of policing factories. when retailers, labor groups, or others inspect these factories, the audits often understate problems because managers regularly coach workers and doctor records. the us government, though, faces special pressures. its record on garment contracting demonstrates the tensions between its low-bid procurement practices and high-road policy objectives on labor and human rights issues. president obama has long pushed for more transparency in procurement. as a senator, he sponsored legislation in 2006 creating the website usaspending.gov, which open-government advocates say has made it far easier to track federal contracting. however, procurement experts fault the website for requiring agencies to name their contractors but not identifying specific factories. some states and cities already require companies to disclose that information before awarding them public contracts, said bjorn skorpen claeson, senior policy analyst at the international labor rights forum.",['ENGLISH'],891,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights

""when war is brought upon us, we will wage war,"" he said. spanish tourist josep lluis cusido said he never got a clear look at the men shooting their way across the bardo museum as he hid behind a pillar. but he noticed that the attacker closest to him seemed young. cusido, mayor of the spanish town of vallmoll, will never know for certain but the man who stood a few yards away was probably 20-year-old yassine laabidi — the younger of the two attackers.

"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Pleasant drop found at lift Website provides deep discounts,,T.D. Thornton Globe correspondent,"snow sports much like travel websites that match customers with deeply discounted airline tickets and hotel rooms, the idea of dynamic internet pricing for lift tickets is moving forward at liftopia (liftopia.com). entering its second year of operation, the company's concept is simple: resorts are willing to drop prices to lure customers during non-peak times, and plenty of people are willing to lock into pay-in-advance deals if it means significant savings on a day of skiing or boarding. although based in san francisco, liftopia has new england roots. one of its founders, evan reece, grew up in topsfield. he learned to ski in the afterschool program at nearby bradford, and was a member of the masconomet regional high school ski team. after graduating from colby college, he ended up working for california-based hotwire, one of the first online travel discount websites.","the concept for the business was born when he and a colleague wanted to make a trip to tahoe and were ""joking about finding discounted lift tickets online."" reece, 29, and associate ron schneidermann soon realized their brain spark was no laughing matter. with the financial help of family and friends, liftopia began operation last year with seven resorts willing to take a chance on their ""merchant model"" business plan. like with any new technology, reece said mountain operators ""responded to the idea conceptually, but getting people to actually jump on board was somewhat of a risk."" reece said he had to prove to resorts that liftopia would generate business. he also had to offer lucrative enough discounts so customers would feel they were getting a bargain. now, after a year of experience and a website redesign, liftopia expects to offer special pricing from 50 mountains nationwide. customers can narrow their choices by requesting prices for regions, resorts, or dates. the quotes will fluctuate depending on a number of variables, but the key factor is that liftopia partner mountains have the flexibility to adjust pricing as they please. for example, a mountain might be willing to slash lift tickets by 40 percent for a slow weekday in january if you're willing to lock in that discount rate right now. but the best deals are not always advance purchases: let's say you want to ski this weekend, but both you and the resort operators know that snow cover is sparse. that same mountain might be willing to reduce prices on a moment's notice depending upon mother nature, posting immediate reductions just to boost volume on a day when business would otherwise suffer. the only drawback is that in exchange for significant discounts, consumers must give up their right to back out of the deal. all lift ticket purchases on liftopia are final and cannot be canceled, exchanged, refunded, or transferred. liftopia's local offerings are currently limited to a handful of resorts in new hampshire and vermont. but, reece said, ""i actually believe new england is the best region we're going to have."" he reasons that the northeast is ripe for success because of its large urban population base within a reasonable drive of many resorts. plus, he added, ""new england skiers tend to be a lot less snobby with regard to weather and snow conditions,"" meaning they are more conducive to day-tripping if the price is right. when asked if he thought that another inherent new england trait - being cheap - would help liftopia, reece laughed and said, ""i've been trying to find a tactful way to phrase that. i guess you could say that new englanders recognize value. we don't like to waste money.""",['ENGLISH'],595,Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-6312225,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '29', 'month': '11', 'year': '2007'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Computer & Internet Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,Tuesday nights are 'Hell' at the Comedy Studio,,,"clockwise from top: owner rick jenkins takes notes during ""com-edy hell"" at his comedy studio; comics wait backstage for their turn to perform; julia corsetti, who is reviving her comedy career while bartending at the lounge, performs; the sign-in sheet; crowd members react to a joke; eli levy checks the sign-in sheet before the evening's acts begin. somerville — on a tuesday night in march, club owner rick jenkins is at his usual table at the back of union square's comedy studio at 7 p.m., a small light illuminating his open notebook.for the next four hours or so, he will watch more than 50 comedians do roughly three minutes of stand-up each. barring bathroom breaks or a quick discussion with a comedian, jenkins will stay at that table for the evening and take notes on every comic. this is the night the club affectionately refers to as ""comedy hell.""","body that evening's host, james huessy, doesn't even take the stage. to save time, he sits at a table stage left and announces who's next. most of the comedians are just starting out, trying to find a voice. others have been around for a few years and are trying out new stuff. some performers will find a calling, some will do it once and never come back. after the first couple of hours, it's fair to wonder who this is for. ""comedy fans,"" jenkins will say later. ""people who are into the process and like seeing the development."" the learning process is laid bare for those paying attention. comics get a yellow light from the soundboard at two minutes, and a red light at three when they are supposed to wrap it up. many take a few seconds before they address the audience, which seems like an eternity in a three-minute set. the majority start with some variation of ""hi, how are you doing?"" it's time wasted that could have been spent grabbing the audience with a joke. some blank on their material and struggle to get to the yellow light. others, like colleen riley, establish who they are immediately. her approach stands out. she tells the crowd she is the mother of four children. ""i don't want my husband to die,"" she says. ""he has really bad life insurance."" at the end of one recent tuesday night, a man wearing a hat that reads ""dood"" gets up second to last, takes a minute to set up his phone to live­stream his set, and starts to tell a raunchy joke that sounds like something out of a cheesy book. he keeps going past the red light, and then gets all the way to the line before the punch line before he notices the stage lights have also changed to red. he leaves without finishing the one joke he came to tell. ""he told . . . a joke you would hear on the street,"" said huessy. ""and it's like, all right, if he's serious about this, he'll learn. if he's not, well, we all got to see that for three minutes."" sitting in the variety lounge out front after the show, jenkins says he doesn't see too many total flame-outs anymore. ""nowadays people have more of an idea of what stand-up comedy is, so you don't see as many novelty acts,"" he says. ""you don't see as many people working out 'issues.' "" the slogan for ""comedy hell"" is taken from an open mic george macdonald started at stitches (now the front room at the paradise rock club) in 1985. ""where the show business pipe-dreams of a handful of road-happy comedy bozos can soar as high as the bright lights of broadway, or crash and burn in that bottomless chasm of despair known simply as 'comedy hell.' "" but it isn't meant to be a freak show. it's meant to be the comedy equivalent of going to the gym, a means to get stronger. unlike many open mics, this one has a paying audience, albeit with a cheap $5 cover. it's a chance to play an actual comedy club, even if you're not a professional yet. ""when you're starting out, your big job is to get the audience's attention,"" says jenkins. ""that next step is: what am i going to do with the attention now that i have it? our room gives them the attention from the start."" usually a few comics each night will ask jenkins about his notes. he'll get as specific as whether someone's michael jackson reference felt dated, but he keeps the focus broad. ""i keep the notes very general and technical,"" he says. ""mostly it's, 'you seemed not comfortable with this' or 'that joke seemed to not fit your persona.' very technical, conventional wisdom stuff. because again, it's up to the artist to decide, well, that's what i wanted."" doing well consistently might lead to a spot on a showcase show at the comedy studio. jenkins will sometimes refer to his open mic notes when booking comics. putting in time and making a noticeable improvement are key, says studio general manager sasha go. ""if you come into a comedy club, any comedy club, and you put on a mediocre performance, why would they want to book you again?"" she says. bookers just want to put up the best show they can. ""they're going to try to get the comics who have potential,"" she adds. the next week, the lineup tips the scale at 63 comedians and three hosts. the front lounge is full of comedians socializing and trying to get on the list for the first 15 spots for the next week. tony v. and chance langton, pros who have been around long enough to have played stitches, drop by to try out new stuff. established comics get bumping rights to go on earlier, but they still have to keep to the time limit. for tony v., this feels strange. ""i haven't done three minutes for any reason in forever,"" he says after his set. ""usually when i'm headlining a show at a club or something, i'm not even out of first gear in three minutes. i've just set up who i am and what i want the people to think. here, you gotta get to the joke."" sam ike, who cohosts ""cityside comedy"" in brighton, says three minutes is just about enough time to speak a couple of thoughts out loud. ""i'm probably trying to work out two jokes that i thought of this morning or last week and i need to hear what it sounds like,"" he says. ""i need to hear what it sounds like in front of people. it's different than me writing it down and saying it in a mirror. i just need to be in a live room."" everyone comes to the open mic with a different experience, and different reasons for doing comedy. welder and arkansas transplant mason smith, 28, talks about how he suffers from being chronically grumpy. his wife has a less print-friendly word for it. he has only been doing stand-up since october, but he'd like to make it his full-time job eventually. ""from what i can tell, it's like a minimum of 10 years before something really happens. so i'm in no hurry or anything. just really trying to get better."" katlin mcfee, 25, has already made an impression at the studio in the six months since she moved from indianapolis. she's been doing comedy for just three years and was on a recent audition for comedy central at the club. she had prepared material, but wound up ditching it to improvise, joking how tinder is getting so competitive it's starting to feel like linkedin. ""they were laughing at a riff i did so i just kept talking about that,"" she says. ""i do that a lot at open mics, because some of my better stuff will come from things that i say just off the top of my head."" julia corsetti, 27, took a job as the lead bartender in the lounge in part so she could restart her comedy career, which she had paused for a couple of years after college. if her set doesn't go well, it can be tough to face customers at the bar afterward, but it's worth it when it works. ""when there's laughter, it just makes you feel warm and like you're doing well,"" she says. ""it's like the highest high i've ever had when it's going well."" miguel perez, 31, started comedy as a birthday present to himself six years ago, and was hooked despite his lack of success. ""i said, 'that was the worst experience ever. i can't believe i did this. and i can't wait to go back again next week.' i did. i went back the week after that and the week after that and the week after that."" toward the end of the night, there are only two people left in the audience. they get up to leave, notice they are the only ones left, and decide to stick it out to support the remaining comedians. sylvia romy, 37, and david nagy, 35, had been to the studio on a friday night, and their tickets from that show got them into this show.

Newspapers,SPORTS;,,STAMPS OF APPROVAL,,,"t wo mondays ago at the annual beanpot luncheon, where all of the four schools' coaches and seniors gather, jason guerriero delivered a light-hearted message to his boston college and boston university opponents. ""to the bc and bu guys, the guys who call me pedro and vladimir, i'm jason,"" said the northeastern forward. ""and i'm italian, not spanish.""    in the crowd, northeastern goalie keni gibson laughed along with his teammates, but there was some truth to guerriero's joke. he is northeastern's captain, but guerriero's name still eludes the tongues of hockey east coaches and players who are more familiar with dominican baseball players than the undrafted senior from manorville, n.y. ""he's a kid that i don't think has gotten enough credit over the years that he should have,"" gibson said. ""he's proving a lot of critics wrong this year.""","gibson was talking about his captain, who is hockey east's fourth-leading scorer with 13 goals and 23 assists, but he could have easily been referring to himself. the senior from stittsville, ontario, enters tonight's beanpot championship against bu with a 12-12-4 record, 2.36 goals-against average, a .921 save percentage, and a league-leading 785 saves. like guerriero, the senior goaltender hasn't been drafted. ""i've seen all the goalies in the league now and i'd rate keni in the top three of the league for sure,"" said northeastern assistant and former husky goalie bruce racine. tonight, the terriers can point to their legacy as they aim for their 26th beanpot title. they are led by a coach who boasts a 48-15 record in the tournament. however, what bu won't have on its side tonight are arguably the game's two most talented players (""he's probably the best goalie in the league,"" bu coach jack parker said of gibson) and perhaps two of the beanpot's most unheralded competitors. guerriero and gibson have been overlooked for the past three years by professional scouts and hockey east insiders - a history they are determined to alter this season. ""it's by far the biggest game of my career right now,"" gibson said. ""for everybody in the room, it's the biggest of their career. my team is trying to leave its mark in the books. we want to do something really great this year, especially our senior class, and leave some kind of stamp in the league."" becoming the best eleven months have passed since the conclusion of the 2003-04 regular season, but it is an ending that gibson recalls all too well. the huskies were clawing for the final hockey east playoff berth, and on feb. 28, gibson stopped 38 shots to lead his club to a 6-3 win over bu, the team just above the huskies in the standings. in the last weekend of the regular season, northeastern swept umass and jumped over bu into the final spot. however, moments after their 3-2 win over the minutemen march 6, gibson and his teammates learned that bu had beaten new hampshire in overtime, snatching eighth place and punting the huskies from the postseason. ""it was going from one of the best highs i've ever had here to one of the biggest lows,"" gibson said. ""it was like jumping off a cliff. you got to the top of the mountain and someone pushed you off. it was heartbreak."" the up-and-down swing of that night reflected most of gibson's career, as northeastern coach bruce crowder compared gibson's development to the peak-and-valley line of a heart monitor. gibson, whose father dennis was the goaltender for one season on bobby orr's oshawa generals junior team, split time his first two seasons with mike gilhooly. but by december of the 2003-04 season, gibson's career turned into a steady ascent. last season, he turned in an 11-13-7 campaign, recording a 2.76 gaa and a .903 save percentage. crowder saw not just improved numbers but a goalie who was heeding the netminding mantra of out, up, and aggressive, confidently challenging shooters at the top of his crease. for gibson, a 5-foot-10-inch, 180-pounder who stands several inches short of a goalie's optimal height, positioning is especially important. this year, gibson has started 28 of northeastern's 30 games, totaling 1,706 minutes - tops in hockey east. against harvard last week, after allowing a first-minute breakaway goal to kevin du, gibson kicked out 39 shots, including several point-blank saves on crimson defenseman noah welch in the first overtime. ""keni is one of the better goaltenders in the country,"" guerriero said. ""when keni plays good, we all play good. in the stanley cup finals, you hear all the time that a goalie's hot and right now keni is. he can take us a long way."" these past two seasons, crowder made clear to gibson that he was the no. 1 goalie and that it was unacceptable for him to turn in subpar efforts. it was an expectation that hindered gibson at times, but crowder believes that the senior has learned to motivate himself toward excellence. ""it's an inner push rather than needing to be pushed by competition or by the fear of not playing,"" crowder said. ""when you look at some of the finer athletes, they find ways to push themselves even if they know they're going to play no matter what. keni had to find that."" gibson credits his maturation to hard work and confidence, which allows him to step into shooters and stay square to incoming pucks. he also praises his goalies coaches (ed kessel for his first three years, and currently racine), who have suggested minor adjustments, but saw no need to overhaul his game. ""i can't take any credit for what keni has done,"" said racine, the two-time beanpot mvp. ""have i helped him? maybe, but in five months, maybe it was a little tweak here or there. really, he's done it all on his own."" silky smooth last friday was an off day for the huskies, but guerriero was still on the ice for an informal practice, making his coach look good. guerriero and crowder, who was wearing a gray sweatshirt and red hat, were taking part in a two-on-none drill where one forward skated behind the net and fed the other a pass for a shot on goal. guerriero curled behind the net and slipped a perfect pass to crowder, who neatly one-timed a roofer into the cage. lately, crowder has looked good just by putting guerriero on the ice. last monday against harvard, guerriero won an offensive-zone draw that led to the huskies' first goal. guerriero, who kicked off the season with a point effort in northeastern's 4-2 win over michigan, has a four-game point streak and trails new hampshire's sean collins by two for the league lead in assists. so far this year, guerriero and linemates mike morris and jared mudryk have combined for 76 points, becoming one of the deadliest lines in hockey east. ""he's got everything you want in a center iceman,"" said parker. ""he can win faceoffs, beat you one-on-one, and can run away from people and find someone who's wide open. he's got the whole package."" not many coaches thought that way four years ago, even after guerriero led the north american hockey league in scoring with 28 goals and 83 points. coaches and pro scouts saw the same thing - a 5-8 forward whose stature might make him a liability. ""people say he's small, but that's heightwise - that's all it is,"" gibson said. ""if you take his heart, he's the biggest kid in the league."" his lack of height is a criticism guerriero, whose long hair and scruffy beard make him a johnny damon look-alike, has heard throughout his career. he acknowledges he doesn't have the longest reach and that his head, as gibson described it, is positioned at the perfect height for opposing elbows. what guerriero has, however, is a sense that crowder calls ""seeing the other plane."" technically, guerriero explains it as being able to see the ice in sections, registering the direction of a pass before it is made, and taking correct angles to arrive at a puck's destination an instant before an opponent. to crowder, it is an ability, honed by hours of improvisational, freewheeling pickup hockey, that allows guerriero to slice through openings and find open ice. it is instinctive hockey sense, a gift that crowder wishes he could evoke from other players, but one that escapes all save for exceptions like guerriero, who now has 135 career points and is northeastern's 21st-leading all-time scorer. ""the ultimate was wayne gretzky,"" crowder said. ""he knew what would happen before it happened. jay's obviously not at that level, but his awareness enables him to find guys, make plays, know when to hold on, and know when to give it up."" for all guerriero's weapons - a whistling wrister, scrappiness in the corners, expansive peripheral vision - perhaps the aspect that makes him especially deadly is his penchant for slowing the game down. while parker says he's fast enough to beat a defender one-on-one, guerriero will often hold onto the puck longer than normal, waiting for a teammate to shake his man. ""i feel that it's god-given talent,"" guerriero said of the ability. ""a lot of guys have it, some guys don't, and their game is grind-it-out."" by doing so, guerriero and his linemates can create more odd-man situations. or, if a defender steps up to challenge guerriero, he can change gears and blow past his opponent. ""part of that is the respect that other teams give him,"" crowder said. ""if they don't go at him under control, he can make them look silly."" while guerriero's rights don't belong to any pro team, he believes that a good showing tonight will merit attention from scouts. the huskies have suffered two straight seasons in which they failed to advance to the playoffs, but a spotlight game such as a beanpot championship is sure to attract the scouts who have ignored the non-playoff clubs of the past two years. ""i'd have no problem paying $40 to see him play,"" gibson said. ""everybody knocks him for his height, but all he needs is a shot. if they give him a shot, that's all he needs to get to the next level."" ",['ENGLISH'],1641,Copyright 2005 Globe Newspaper Company,BGLOBE-0502140054,,,THIRD EDITION,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '14', 'month': '02', 'year': '2005'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000170', 'className': 'BASEBALL'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Bicyclist dies in crash in city,BU grad student becomes 5th such victim this year,,"christopher weigl was ready to submit his ­final project of the semester wednesday for a multimedia class at boston university when a technical glitch stole all his editing work. it was the kind of thing that makes the average first-year graduate student crumble. not weigl. he stayed up late wednesday, finished the project, and sent it electronically to his professor, whose class he was scheduled to attend at 9 a.m. thursday, said peter southwick, director of photojournalism at bu's college of communication. weigl never made that class. the 23-year-old photojournalism grad student was killed on commonwealth avenue at 8:36 a.m. thursday after his bicycle collided with a tractor-trailer turning onto st. paul street. the crash, which shut down the 900 block of commonwealth ­avenue through the afternoon, is being investigated by boston police. no charges or citations have been issued. weigl was the fifth bicyclist killed in a crash in boston this year, an issue addressed at a ­previously scheduled city council meeting on bicycle safety just hours after the latest fatality. councilors observed a moment of silence for weigl at the start of the meeting.","boston police said weigl, who was riding in a marked bike lane, was wearing a helmet thursday. ""he was a calm hand on the wheel, had tons of common sense, very aware of the risks of riding a bike,"" said charlie ­maher, one of his three roommates. ""he was smart. he wasn't some reckless kid on a bike without a helmet. that's not the way he is at all."" the professor in weigl's multimedia class, peter smith, canceled regular class affairs thursday, opting to honor weigl's memory by showing his final project and another student's project, which happened to be a video profile of weigl. dan herard, weigl's roommate and friend since grade school, said weigl was the glue that kept friendships together. a ""goofy"" guy who always had a smile on his face, weigl enjoyed the outdoors, dancing to techno music, and seemed to befriend everyone he met, herard said. ""he always kept a positive attitude,"" herard said. ""he was one of those people. drove some people nuts because he was always happy. he was just chris; there's so much that ­encapsulates that."" kuan liu was aboard the green line's b train thursday morning when she came upon the chaotic scene on commonwealth avenue: a body covered in a white sheet under a tractor-trailer. a devastated liu later learned the person under that sheet was the very first friend she made at bu, where she is enrolled as an international student. he was her assigned ambassador at the school, helping her navigate a new school and country. weigl would invite liu to his brighton apartment, as he did all his friends, to watch television. when liu could not under­stand what was being said, weigl would patiently ­explain it all. ""he would always help me. he would walk me home when i was by myself to make sure i'm safe,"" liu said. ""i can't imagine this person in my life is the person under the white cloth."" hours after the collision, more than 60 bicycling advocates gathered in city hall's council chambers for a bike safety meeting sponsored by councilors at large ayanna pressley and felix arroyo. while councilors and bike advocates acknowledged that the quality of cycling in boston had improved drastically in ­recent years   more than 50 miles of bike lanes have been added since 2007   they agreed the city urgently needs to take a closer look at safety. from jan. 1 to nov. 13, there have been 579 bicycle-related incidents in the city that required response by emergency medical services, said kristopher carter, interim director at boston bikes, the city's cycling initiative. in that same period in 2011, there were 548 bicycle-related incidents requiring ems response, he said. although the number of acci­dents has increased about 5 percent from last year, carter said it is difficult to say whether the statistics point to a decline in cyclist safety or reflect more bicyclists taking to the road. from 2011 to 2012, the city saw a 31 percent increase in bicyclists on the streets, he said. pete stidman, executive ­director of the boston cyclists union, called on officials to move beyond the who-was-at-fault blame game after bike ­fatalities, and to talk about ways to rethink the city's transportation infrastructure. ""what you hear a lot is, 'what are we doing about these scofflaw cyclists?' i'm not saying that cyclists don't cause acci­dents; they do,"" said stidman, citing one study that found bicyclists at fault in one-quarter of bike accidents. ""but that is not the key problem."" councilor matt o'malley agreed. ""helmets are so important, but it's not just about helmets,"" he said. ""it's not just about blaming the victims that way. it's about having serious conversations about what we need to do."" much of the discussion ­focused on cycle tracks, lanes for bicycles that are physically protected from vehicular traffic with medians, plastic posts, or an aisle of parked cars. they have been successful in cities such as montreal, but require more money and road space than regular bike lanes. advocates also stressed the importance of obtaining comprehensive data on accidents, rather than piecemeal data from various city agencies that often lack crucial details about the nature of a bike accident. until recently, some police and ems reports did not differentiate between collisions involving pedestrians or a bicyclist. carter said city officials are working to publish a more thorough report by year's end. stanley brown, who works at the cvs pharmacy at the intersection where weigl collided with the truck, said that he noticed the tractor-trailer making a right turn onto st. paul street from the far left lane that the ­bicycle ""was just going too fast to react to the truck."" ""when i saw him get hit, i knew there's nothing really that could be done,"" brown said. ""there was no way he could have survived that."" he said the truck driver got out of his vehicle, looked briefly at the bicyclist, and then returned to his cab. he appeared shaken but showed no obvious sign of intoxication or impairment, brown said. carter, of boston bikes, said commonwealth avenue is ­often clogged with pedestrians, bicyclists, motor vehicles, and mbta green line trolleys. the dean of bu's communications college, tom fiedler, said grief counselors and university chaplains are being made available to students, faculty, and staff. southwick, director of the college's photojournalism program, described weigl as ""one of the best students i've ever had in the program."" ""what stood out the most was his sensitivity, his ability to connect with people so that you saw emotional power in the photographs. they weren't posed, they weren't self-conscious, they were genuine. the kind of moments that allow a viewer to share the experience and get into the life of his subjects."" globe correspondent melissa m. werthmann contributed to this report. katheleen conti can be reached at kconti@globe.com martine powers can be reached at mpowers@globe.com",['ENGLISH'],1173,Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-c2f070dc-3fae-11e2-a30e-d61c44b2370c,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '07', 'month': '12', 'year': '2012'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000008', 'className': 'ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001325', 'className': 'PHOTOJOURNALISM'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000440', 'className': 'CYCLING'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D4JV', 'className': 'CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST0009UHV', 'className': 'MUSIC'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"

,NORTHWEST WEEKLY; Pg. 1,,Schools set rules on fund drives;,,,"it sounded like a perfectly harmless idea to the parents at lexington's fiske school. why not set up a fund, separate from the pta, through which parents could contribute money directly for school projects? ""they could donate in a teacher's name at holiday time, instead of giving another coffee mug,"" reasoned kamala madhu, president of fiske's parent-teacher association. ""we wanted to call it the 'fiske fund.' ""","but the proposal fueled a debate in lexington over whether the expanding role of fund-raising in public education creates inequities among the town's six elementary schools. ""what do we do if school x has the resources to raise $ 25,000 for computers and school y - for whatever set of reasons - does not?"" asked superintendent jeffrey young. ""then it means the kids in school x have a more advantageous learning environment."" ahhh, for the good old days of bake sales. there was a time when parent-teacher associations raised a few dollars for field trips and then shut off the coffee maker. but those days are long gone, as budget cuts force parent groups into paying for playgrounds, enrichment programs, teacher materials, graduation ceremonies, even computers for the classrooms or a sound system for the gym. how that money is raised and spent is increasingly under scrutiny in many communities in the northwest weekly region. most school officials in the region either prohibit or discourage children from making door-to-door solicitations - a concern that was heightened this fall after an 11-year-old new jersey boy was murdered while selling wrapping paper and candy for his school's pta. some systems also limit the number of fund-raising events at schools. ""one, we have concern about the health, safety and well-being of our youngsters being on the streets and going door to door,"" said methuen superintendent phillip littlefield. ""secondly, it's a community-relations thing. people generally don't like door-to-door solicitations. they don't like to be disturbed in their homes."" not only does the methuen school committee's policy prohibit door-to-door sales, it also prohibits the use of prizes or incentives to stimulate sales and limits fund-raising at each school to one major event each year, littleton said. ""the primary role of a public school is not a fund-raiser,"" he said. ""it's an educational institution."" yet as demands increase for parents to pay for sports, band and the many other extras that were once part of school budgets, ptas and booster clubs have jumped into the breach with ever more creative ways to raise money. communitywide educational foundations are also gaining support, raising money for teacher grants and other projects through golf tournaments, spelling bees and walkathons. ""there's a new role for parents to fund-raise for things that become an integral part of the classroom, as compared to things that supplement and enrich,"" said susan villani, principal of the thoreau school in concord. ""years ago, playground equipment was part of a school budget. now it is not,"" said villani. ""it's very, very hard to have as much money in a school budget as we would like for technology."" while welcoming the contributions, school administrators said they want to be sensitive to parents and business people who grow tired of being dunned for donations nine months of the year. ""if you're fund-raising for enrichment, and you're fund-raising for playground equipment, and then you're fund-raising for technology, at some point, the merchants are going to say, 'how many times can i donate?' or the parents say, 'i've been buying things all fall,' "" villani observed. bedford's answer? the ""holiday shopping afternoon."" on dec. 14, from noon to 6 p.m., participating merchants in bedford will either donate 3 percent of their sales or a flat amount to the bedford schools association, a townwide group that provides grants for teachers and enrichment programs. ""in turn, we said we would promote, advertise and encourage people to shop on that day. we have musicians from the high school who will play in the supermarkets, and we have carolers who will go around town singing and performing,"" said robyn samuels, the association's president. ""in a small town, it's the same pockets you pick over and over again. we were hoping that if we could do a one-time thing, the smaller school groups would come to us instead of tapping all of these businesses."" barbara mcelhiney, president of the bedford chamber of commerce, called it ""a win, win, win situation: good for the schools, good for the families, good for commercial business."" in north andover, superintendent george blaisdell said parent and community groups try to take a ""balanced approach"" to fund-raising. but he added that, however onerous, fund-raising is a good way for parents to become involved in their schools. ""i'm not sure that the school system shouldn't have as a regular part of its budget some of the enriching activities and the field trips. i guess in a perfect world, the school system would pay for those things,"" blaisdell said. ""on the other hand, we have a pretty good degree of parental involvement in our schools, and that's a positive."" but can it be overdone? in lexington, school officials are examining how all the fund-raising entities - parent-teacher associations, booster clubs, student groups and the lexington education foundation - can best do their work while maintaining equity among the schools. ""people here are so concerned about the quality of the schools and want so much to keep them at a high level, they go out and invest lots of time in raising additional funds, and i think that's a great thing,"" young said. ""the unintended consequence is that it can produce inequities throughout the system."" administrators are attempting to formulate a set of policy recommendations to take to the school committee, he said. madhu, president of fiske's pta, agreed that the children who attend one school in lexington should receive the same quality of education as the children who attend another. but in practice, she observed, ""there are parents who are willing to give large amounts of money if they feel their child will benefit."" and as schools reduce money for equipment, programs and professional development, she said the tensions increase. ""where does the pta step in with things that really should be part of the capital budget of the schools?"" madhu said. ""it's a tough line to walk when you have your own children at a school and you want them to benefit.""",['ENGLISH'],1094,Copyright 1997 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'month': '11', 'day': '30', 'year': '1997'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N813400CC', 'className': 'CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000769', 'className': 'FUNDRAISING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001691', 'className': 'TEACHING & TEACHERS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00098PN', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Administration & Operation'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTNDOTREN0QwMTQwNDJCMkJGODMxOUY2QUIyNzI2QTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI', 'className': 'Instructional Materials'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTk0MTc3MzdGQkU0NDI1OEFGOTA3NTkyRTJFM0VCQTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjZBQUM2RjM4QkI4NDlFMkFCNTBDMzJGNDg0MTgxOUU', 'className': 'Allocation of Funds'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N813211MM', 'className': 'FOUNDATIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00096UU', 'className': 'DIRECT SALES FORCE'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00098PN', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTk0MTc3MzdGQkU0NDI1OEFGOTA3NTkyRTJFM0VCQTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjZBQUM2RjM4QkI4NDlFMkFCNTBDMzJGNDg0MTgxOUU', 'className': 'Allocation of Funds'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000218', 'className': 'BUDGETS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST000CTLO', 'className': 'BUDGET CUTS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST00096SX', 'className': 'COMMUNITY RELATIONS'}]}"
"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Gophers ambush Eagles,Four goals in first for No. 1 Minnesota,,"minneapolis — sunday afternoon games are rare in college hockey. after sunday's rough outing against top-ranked minnesota, it's likely boston college will want to stick to the more traditional friday and saturday evening schedule. the gophers scored on four of their first seven shots, taking advantage of a defense that looked out of sorts and cruising to a 6-1 win at the big ten/hockey east challenge.","the fifth-ranked eagles, who have just one more sunday afternoon game on their schedule this season, got a goal from evan richardson and 26 saves from brian billett, but fell to 2-2-1. ""we gave them four quality chances in the first period, and they cashed in on all four,"" said eagles coach jerry york. ""that set the tone for the game. during the course of the 60 minutes, we played some really good hockey, but we didn't match them. our breakdowns were really taken advantage of by the gophers."" minnesota's early offense likely provided billett with unpleasant déjà vu. unlike friday's tournament opener, when bc went toe to toe with minnesota for 65 minutes, forging a 3-3 tie and winning the exhibition shootout, billett's third start of the season was somewhat similar to the eagles' 8-1 loss in minneapolis last season. in that game, bc trailed, 6-0, in the third when billett came on in relief of starter parker milner and allowed two goals on three shots. ""we can't blame any of it on [billett],"" said eagles center bill arnold. ""we were hanging him out to dry. we talked about neutral-zone turnovers and turnovers at their blue line. there was just too much of that. they're a fast team that will capitalize when we do that, and we just weren't good enough."" as they had done on friday, the gophers (5-0-1) got the crowd whipped up early, taking a 1-0 lead less than five minutes in when nate condon capped a two-on-one break by slipping a backhander between billett's knees. less than a minute later it was 2-0 when a defensive breakdown by the eagles left seth ambroz all alone with the puck in front of billett. the goalie stopped ambroz's initial shot, but could not control the rebound. while the eagles were struggling defensively, the gophers' defensemen were getting in on the fun. mike reilly and brady skjei scored before the first period was done. still, when it was over, even the gophers credited billett for staying sharp in the face of adversity. ""after that [first period] he played very well,"" said minnesota coach don lucia. ""the ones we scored on him were quality shots. that's going to happen sometimes. we were tested plenty."" the eagles finally made a mark on the scoreboard six minutes into the middle period. gophers goalie adam wilcox, who finished with 31 saves, stopped an initial shot by quinn smith, but could not recover in time to get the rebound. richardson, a freshman playing in just his second game, snapped the puck past wilcox for his first career goal. ""you have to take what you can from that game. we weren't ready to play, they were a fast team,"" arnold said. ""a lot of that has to do with preparation. we're going to go back and watch film and there are a ton of things we will find out we can do better. i think we're a much better team than the way we played today."" trailing, 6-1, late in the third, eagles defenseman michael matheson was sent off for a major charging penalty for a hit on condon. minnesota controlled play for much of the five minutes, but the eagles killed the penalty. the eagles have a home-and-home series with northeastern next weekend, playing friday at conte forum and saturday at matthews arena.",['ENGLISH'],717,Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-03e7002e-3f4f-11e3-80d2-dbabac615b30,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '28', 'month': '10', 'year': '2013'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '74', 'classCode': 'GX614', 'className': 'MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS139', 'className': 'MINNESOTA, USA'}]}"

"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,Philanthropist aims to help Colombia kick cocaine curse,Howard Buffett pledges $200m for a key region,,"howard buffett (center) visited la gabarra, colombia, last month with the nation's president, iván duque (right). tibu, colombia — with colombian military snipers in position, howard buffett descends from a helicopter and trudges through the wet grass in steel-toe boots chewed through by his dog's teeth. waiting under a tin-roofed shack is a small group of coca farmers. they've never heard of multi-billionaire investor warren buffett, but after decades of neglect by their own government they're grateful for the outstretched hand of his eldest son, who they refer to simply as ""the gringo."" ""there's a saying here: the less you know, the better,"" said rubén morantes, his leathery skin and calloused hands a testament to a lifetime of tillage in one of colombia's most-dangerous territories, where outsiders are traditionally mistrusted.","body for nearly two decades buffett, 65, has crisscrossed the world giving away part of his father's fortune to promote food security, conflict mitigation, and public safety. but his latest gamble is one of the most daunting yet: helping colombia kick its cocaine curse. he is focusing on tibu, heart of the remote, notoriously lawless catatumbo region bordering venezuela where buffett accompanied president iván duque. tibu has the second largest coca crop in all of colombia — 28,200 acres, according to the united nations. drug production as well as violence has skyrocketed in the area since armed groups filled the void left by retreating rebels who signed a peace deal with the government in 2016. the howard g. buffett foundation has committed to spending $200 million over the next few years to transform the impoverished municipality into a model of comprehensive state building. plans include strengthening security forces and helping farmers secure land titles and substitute coca — the raw material for cocaine — with licit crops like cacao. the first component is building 185 miles of roads to connect the municipality's 37,000 residents for the first time with national and international markets. it's a challenge made more difficult by lurking guerrillas who last year detonated a homemade bomb as army engineers were working on the road, killing five people and injuring several. ""the only way we have confidence that farmers can grow legal crops is if they can get those crops to market,"" buffett told farmers during a visit last month with duque to la gabarra, a rural outpost in tibu. it was the first time any colombian president had visited the blood-soaked hamlet. the plan envisions subsidies and training for farmers as they switch crops, as well as helping them find buyers. it also aims to strengthen infrastructure for local law enforcement. but some experts worry buffett's enthusiasm for speeding colombia's development is no match for entrenched corruption in rural areas run like political fiefdoms. there's also the challenge posed by thousands of venezuelan migrants who lack roots in the community and are being targeted for recruitment by criminal gangs. a lot is riding on buffett's investment. not since the start of the us-led plan colombia two decades ago have so many resources converged on a single geographical area, said álvaro balcázar, who helped the government negotiate with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia the section of the peace deal focusing on illicit crops. ""there's no precedent for something on such a large scale,"" balcázar said. ""but the region is strategic for consolidating peace in colombia."" like his father, howard buffett has a reputation for folksy, midwestern plain speech and self-effacing humor. and lthough the son's a three-time college dropout, warren buffett wants howard to succeed him as the non-executive chairman of berkshire hathaway, the $550 billion conglomerate that owns companies such as duracell, dairy queen, and geico insurance as well as major stakes in leading us airlines and banks. but howard's spent much of his adult life roving the world taking wildlife photos and writing books. he's also a corn farmer and made headlines in 2017 by briefly serving as the sheriff of macon county, ill., where he lives and his foundation is based. he began exploring the world as a teenager on a trip to soviet-controlled prague in 1969 to visit one of the many exchange students his mother hosted at their home in omaha. but his love of travel hasn't been matched by culinary curiosity: in catatumbo, he carried around a blue, insulated lunch pack containing his requisite pb&j sandwich and a dr. pepper. as a philanthropist, his priority now is helping colombia and el salvador, whose fight against drug trafficking has a direct impact on the us. between the two countries he has already spent or committed $310 million, including the funding in el salvador of a new police forensics center and a modern system to help the country's prosecutors track criminal investigations. as a volunteer police officer who logged 678 hours on patrol last year, buffett has seen firsthand the human toll caused by drug addiction. a few weeks before traveling to colombia, he and a partner were staking out a motel in decatur, ill., at 1 a.m. when they arrested a man possessing crack. with him was a woman who said she had a drug problem, so buffett paid for her to stay at the hotel two nights. later, he referred her to a county rehab facility paid for with a gift from the buffett foundation in the hopes she would get help. ""these are people who need our help,"" he said. ""they're not criminals."" he has turned to latin america after years of focusing much of his attention on africa and especially rwanda, where he works with the government on sustainable agriculture. he spent so much time at his farm in south africa in the 1990s that he obtained permanent residency. buffett began working in colombia in 2008 helping pop star shakira set up schools in her hometown of barranquilla. he's also funded an army unit removing thousands of land mines strewn across former conflict zones. leveraging his business contacts, he established a program to help around 100 families in southern colombia switch from growing coca to producing high-quality coffee for nespresso. while an enthusiastic supporter of the 2016 peace deal, he has nonetheless struck a close relationship with duque, a law-and-order conservative who rode into office attacking the agreement. duque has vowed to slash cocaine production in half by the end of 2023. production of the drug skyrocketed after his predecessor — nobel peace prize laureate juan manuel santos — halted aerial eradication in 2015 due to health concerns over the herbicides used. but reaching that goal requires huge resources the government doesn't have, as well as overcoming the indifference of urban voters who are removed from the conflict and have their own growing list of demands. that's where buffett steps in. the $200 million buffett has pledged for tibu is more than triple what the government has spent the past two years altogether on public works in 170 high-risk municipalities that are part of a rural development rescue plan mandated by the peace deal. the us agency for international development spends $230 million annually in colombia, although its projects are spread across the country. beyond the big check, long-time partners praise the buffett foundation for being independent and nimble. it's funded from an annual gift in berkshire hathaway stock by warren buffett, so it can take risks few are willing to attempt, development experts say. ""we're accountable mainly to the irs,"" joked buffett, who sees setbacks like a venture capitalist who must eat crow before finding wild success. ""if you're a charity, and you're going to have your annual banquet to raise a lot of money, you can't stand up there and tell people how you had these five failures and this one success. people aren't going to write checks,"" he said. ""we'll make a decision in five minutes if we know what we want to do."" he is skeptical of the us government and united nations, preferring not to work with either. ""the reason is because we can't depend on them,"" said buffett, who said he was burned badly by usaid in 2011 when it abandoned a joint $10 million seed program for starving farmers in south sudan just as fighting broke out in the world's newest independent state. ""the bullets started flying and they pulled out. but it's like you're in south sudan, so of course bullets are going to fly,"" he said. instead, the foundation relies on partners known for delivering results quickly and slim overhead — a combination he says is hard to find among the ""beltway bandits"" profiting from us foreign aid outlays. one accompanying him to catatumbo is portland, ore.-based mercy corps, which is helping farmers sort through colombia's bureaucratic maze to obtain land titles. in a nod to his father's reputation for common sense, buffett seeks frequent counsel from the so-called ""oracle of omaha."" ""he's my sounding board, kind of like my conscience in a way,"" buffett said. ""but he never asks, 'why are you doing that?' or 'why are you taking that risk?' "" in tibu, after cracking a few jokes and planting a cacao tree, he seemed beside himself with joy even as the presidential committee hustled to quickly depart as heavy fog threatened to maroon them in the middle of nowhere. ""i know emilio is very worried about leaving,"" buffett told the farmers through a translator, referring to duque's post-conflict adviser, emilio archila. ""but i'm not, because there's lots of chocolate here.""",['ENGLISH'],1623,Copyright 2020 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-8f40aa18-4e6a-11ea-a2d0-1fdf58d37a90,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '16', 'month': '02', 'year': '2020'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Tax Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000319', 'className': 'COCAINE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000278', 'className': 'CHARITIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813211MM', 'className': 'FOUNDATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008XKB', 'className': 'PHILANTHROPY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001456', 'className': 'REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CN', 'className': 'ARMIES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000535', 'className': 'CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000195', 'className': 'BOMBS & EXPLOSIVE DEVICES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D90O', 'className': 'IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001511', 'className': 'RURAL COMMUNITIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001963', 'className': 'SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001822', 'className': 'WEALTHY PEOPLE'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00090NW', 'className': 'AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000622', 'className': 'ENGINEERING'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000D0FD', 'className': 'FOOD SECURITY'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU4', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'STX001304', 'className': 'PEACE PROCESS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CN', 'className': 'ARMIES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009F94', 'className': 'COCOA FARMING'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00090NW', 'className': 'AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000622', 'className': 'ENGINEERING'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009VLS', 'className': 'WARREN BUFFETT'}], 'country': [{'score': '98', 'classCode': 'GC341', 'className': 'COLOMBIA'}]}"

""humankind"", which was produced at a small studio here and premieres in boston tomorrow at 3 p.m. on wbur (90.9 fm), profiles people from different walks of life striving in daily ways to make a difference.  in a time of widespread cynicism, ""humankind,"" the brainchild of award-winning documentary producer david freudberg, celebrates old-fashioned values - integrity, compassion, equality, and generosity.","  belmont - fed up with monica? weary of murder, fire, hurricanes, and endless other tragedies? ""i strongly believe people are looking for a clear articulation of ideals and values,"" said freudberg, 43, who has worked in public radio since he was a teenager in philadelphia.  ""i think it's a very dangerous thing for our society to have the degree of cynicism that i see as being almost pervasive,"" said freudberg. ""it's corrosive, and i have been thirsting for some way in which the media can responsibly provide another road.""  ""humankind"" includes the voices of a man who drives a truck delivering food to homeless shelters; a former reporter who started a summer camp in maine for israeli and arab children; and an elderly woman who each week rides two buses and a subway to pick up food at a food pantry for her friend who can't get around easily.  driving a delivery truck for a food charity is ""a blessing,"" herman manigo told freudberg in one episode, ""because i've been where a lot of these people are now.  ""i mean, you can survive being broke, but it's very difficult when you don't have food on the table for your kids, because they don't understand that. now i have a chance to give back and i wouldn't trade it in for nothing in the world.""  other ""humankind"" episodes highlight a hospice in north carolina where patients receive free care; the effects on personal discipline of fasting, and personal questions about how individuals choose to donate to charity.  the people freudberg profiles aren't saints. they are simply ordinary people motivated by a sense of decency that freudberg says he found moving and inspiring.  listen to jerry smith, a counselor at seeds of peace, the summer camp in otisfield, maine, for israeli and palestinian youth, talk about what happens when youngsters who are supposed to hate each other have a chance to play and talk with each other.  ""you can spend your whole life hating your enemy, but that one moment that you take to love your enemy and find a way to get past that hate really helps you move forward in your own life,"" said smith.  crisscrossing the country, speaking to dozens of people, freudberg said he found several overarching themes among many americans today.  one is a longing for a sense of community. a second is a desire to carve out ""quiet time"" to escape our frenetic lives. a third is a concern not only with what we do in our work lives, but how we do it.  a fourth theme freudberg heard repeatedly is that you get ""back so much more from giving than from receiving."" and, finally, the possibility that people in trouble can transform their lives.  freudberg met a vietnam war veteran tortured by memories of some of the things he was ordered to do during the war, who was able to exorcise his demons and overcome a drug addiction by joining a veteran's organization that builds health clinics in vietnam.  ""for me ideals are the direction that my compass points to,"" freudberg said.

""i might be arrogant, but i must not seem arrogant.""  bulger's confidence appears to be well-placed. three senators who have been considered anti-bulger or uncommitted told the globe they now do not rule out voting for him. those votes appear to give bulger more than the 21 he needs for reelection to the post he has held since 1978.  clearly savoring the fact that he emerged largely unscathed from his toughest political challenge ever, bulger could not resist a few jabs at keating and at michael goldman, the political consultant who masterminded the keating challenge.  ""despite all of the attacks, i never felt really threatened,"" said bulger, 60.  bulger scoffed at the tactics employed by keating and goldman. he said their strategy of trying to unseat his allies and replace them with keating allies was doomed ""from the outset"" and ""could only have been arrived at by . . . a consultant.""

,ARTS & FILM; Pg. D18,,Haitink scales the heights of Bruckner;,,," like all the greatest masters of the symphonic form, bruckner is unique. the roots of his music take nourishment from beethoven, schubert, wagner, and brahms, but the music sounds like nothing else in the world. for that reason it is essential to the inner lives of many who listen to it; for the great lieder composer hugo wolf, who worked in entirely different dimensions of musical experience, the eighth symphony ""towers above all of bruckner's other symphonies in its spiritual dimensions, its fertility, and its grandeur.""","  bernard haitink's second program with the boston symphony orchestra this season is devoted to bruckner's massive 80-minute eighth symphony, and following the glorious close of the finale - heaven will have a lot to live up to - the audience witnessed one of the rarest sights in the concert hall: the musicians refused to recognize the conductor's signal to rise and accept the applause with him, joining instead the fervid ovation of the audience. bruckner requires submission to a different sense of space and time, and acceptance, or temporary acceptance, of a different set of values. listening attentively to bruckner can be a form of spiritual instruction, of spiritual discipline, particularly now, in a modern world that is geared to different attention spans and more immediate forms of gratification than 30-minute symphonic movements. for that very reason, some people, even highly musical ones, don't want to listen to bruckner at all, and find the music irritating and irrelevant. there are orchestral players, including some in the boston symphony, who arrange their vacation days to avoid having to play bruckner. there are always pockets of empty seats at bruckner concerts; but the other seats are filled with devotees.  the eighth symphony exists in two versions bearing the composer's authority; the second, revised version, brings improvements, but the composer also listened to some bad advice. haitink therefore chose the edition made in the 1930s by robert haas that eliminates some of the unhelpful advice from the revision.  a great bruckner conductor must have an exceptionally solid sense of architecture to lay the foundations for the soaring gothic arches; he must also be responsive to the mysteries of the great dim-lit spaces. bruckner was a figure with rough, rural characteristics (the joke went round that carpenters built his trousers); he also had a peasant's daily apprehension of the underlying rhythms of life, and a mystic's ability to see the rapturous nimbus of the sublime surrounding the most ordinary things.  haitink does not traffic in musical mysticism, and he doesn't try to throw a nimbus around anything - he let bruckner do that. what he does instead, through purely musical means - control of rhythm, pace, balance, structure - is deliver, with stunning immediacy and clarity, the full force of bruckner's uncompromising vision. he also has the ability to inspire others to share his conception of that vision, and the playing of the boston symphony last night was magisterial. it had weight, solidity, and force, but it also had transparency and wonder. first-class brass playing is essential to bruckner, and the musicians rose to the challenge, particularly the nine players of horns and wagner tubas; solos are always related to ensemble, and all of the little solos, from the opening cuckoo of the clarinet, made crucial contributions. haitink approaches his task with humility and authority, and the precision, strength, and stamina of a stonecutter; and that's what you need to have if what you're building is a cathedral.",['ENGLISH'],606,Copyright 1998 Globe Newspaper Company,,,,",City Edition",The Boston Globe,"{'month': '10', 'day': '23', 'year': '1998'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009UHV', 'className': 'MUSIC'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000305', 'className': 'CLASSICAL MUSIC'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009VG1', 'className': 'MUSIC COMPOSITION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000D5FK', 'className': 'ASTROLOGISTS & PSYCHICS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X5L', 'className': 'PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009VC0', 'className': 'ARTISTS & PERFORMERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}]}"
