SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) You could be surprised to hear what a friend is doing, and you might decide to join him or her.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) You seem to be too confident for your own good right now. You could be out and about doing some price comparison. An older relative or friend might have a suggestion that no one has thought of yet; think seriously about this suggestion. Tonight: You don't need to go far. AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) Enjoy all the laughable conversations happening around you. A friend could add a very serious tone that might make you rather uncomfortable. Ask yourself what bothers you about this behavior. Coming up with the answer will be important. Tonight: Treat a friend to dinner. PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20) Take some much-needed personal time. If you want to be a couch potato, make it so. In any case, you are at the end of a quiet period where the action is likely to ramp up. Do a better job of listening when having an important talk.

"caryn and i raised our kids together. we were kids together, but we didn't know it then. we thought we were grown-ups, 19 and 20, both of us in love, engaged, both of us planning our weddings. she was my husband's friend first. he knew her from trinity episcopal church, where both their families were active members, in the choir, on committees. we met for the first time at her parents' house. it was christmas eve. she introduced me to her fianc√©, john.
that was the beginning. her daughter michele was born first. then my son rob. then kerry to her and lauren to me. then five years later, she had sarah and i had julie. our kids were friends. our husbands were friends. we were friends. these were good times. we lived only seven miles apart for 20 years. there must have been days we didn't see each other, didn't strap our kids into the car and drive to each other's house. but i don't remember those days. i remember playing. we were always playing. we took the kids to parks and to playgrounds and to jolly cholly's, and we took them, most times, just to each other's houses, where we'd hang out, coloring, making ice cream, making a mess. on weekend nights we played cards or yahtzee with our husbands, one week at her house, the next week at mine. eventually we played racquetball every weekend, ending the night with pizza at the town spa. caryn taught me that plaids are supposed to match. she also taught me how to match them and how to interface collars and how to make bound buttonholes. she taught me to knit, too, and to crochet, and to not be afraid to do a back flip off the diving board. one spring, she signed me up for tennis lessons ‚Äî that was a bust. and winter after winter she tried to teach me to ice skate. she still does all these things. her house was always under construction. john kept building rooms, adding on, adding up. i never thought they'd move. but caryn got breast cancer and after chemo and radiation and months of feeling sick and wondering if she'd ever be better, she was. cancer changed her life. she always wanted to live by the ocean. so she and john sold their sprawling house in walpole along with most of its contents and bought a little place right on the water in scituate. and john got to work adding on and adding up there. caryn found her purpose: working with the elderly. she jumped out of a plane. she ran the boston marathon. she golfed with john. she bought a kayak. she loved this new part of her life. but she was no longer just seven miles away, so there was no hanging out every friday night. no ""i was in the neighborhood, so i thought i'd stop by."" things changed. our kids grew up and then we had grandkids and jobs and more to do than when our kids were little. still, we saw each other at holidays and birthdays and christenings and baby showers and random times when we'd meet for dinner, just the two of us, just because. and we saw each other on the cape, for a few days in the summer, her kids and their kids and my kids and grandkids. all of us, together. and every time, all the time, it was like old times. last week she and john moved to south carolina. ""it's only a plane ride away,"" we both said. ""we hardly see each other anyway. we'll probably see each other more. we'll talk. we'll text. it will all be fine."" and maybe it will be. but it doesn't feel fine today. it feels like loss. it feels like the empty space a carnival leaves behind when it packs up and leaves town. it feels like what it is: a thousand-mile gulf. we'll get used to it. but right now, today, i miss my friend. beverly beckham lives in canton. she can be reached at beverlybeckham@me.com",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uDGrBXDmlRUK7wY6A68k2ANwvmVmHaKH&usp=drive_copy,White,1

"South African riot police fired rubber bullets to disperse immigrants and protesters who clashed during a march Friday in Pretoria.
JOHANNESBURG ‚Äî Anti-immigrant protesters clashed with foreigners during a march in South Africa's administrative capital, Pretoria, on Friday, and the police responded with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. President Jacob Zuma appealed for calm and condemned the latest wave of anti-foreigner violence to grip South Africa in recent years. ""Many citizens of other countries living in South Africa are law-abiding and contribute to the economy of the country positively,"" Zuma said. ""It is wrong to brand all nonnationals as drug dealers or human traffickers,"" he said. ""Let us isolate those who commit such crimes and work with government to have them arrested, without stereotyping and causing harm to innocent people."" Africans coming legally and illegally to South Africa, which has the continent's most advanced economy, have been the focus of criticism and resentment and sometimes of violent attacks in recent years. South Africans accuse migrants of stealing jobs or exploiting locals by running small businesses in poor, black townships. Others blame foreigners for the country's high crime rates. The accusations, which are not backed up by official statistics, resonate in a country with a jobless rate of 27 percent and yawning income inequalities. The latest anti-immigrant violence began in a neighborhood south of Johannesburg called Rosettenville, where residents burned down a dozen houses that they said were being used by Nigerians as drug dens and brothels. The attacks spread to other areas, including in Pretoria, where immigrant areas and businesses were targeted.

"q. i am in seventh grade. i think that my parents' marriage is happy, but they have problems. i think these problems are mostly my mother's fault, because she is constantly accusing my dad of doing little things wrong. she never actually confronts him about it but complains to me, which makes me feel like she is putting me in an unfair position. she also claims that he shuts her out of conversations and shoots her down when she tries to talk, but i frankly feel that he is just defending his argument and that she is being extra-sensitive on purpose. most of the time they get along ok, but they never kiss (at least not in front of me) and they don't really act like they are in love anymore.
i think they need marriage counseling, but i don't know how to talk to them about it. this has become very painful for me. how can i persuade them to go to marriage counseling? i am very scared that they will become very unhappy with each other, and get a divorce. parents with problems a. your parents may have marital problems, but one big mistake they're making is to involve you in their personal, adult relationship. you are in seventh grade   you should not be expected to take sides in their disputes or mediate their marriage. you are obviously bright and perceptive. i can understand why they trust your point of view, but they may not realize the extent to which they violate your right to be a kid. tell them both: ""i worry so much when you don't get along. i wish you would not involve me in your arguments. and i really wish you would see a professional because i don't know how to help you, and i'm worried you'll get divorced."" i hope they will follow your excellent instinct and seek marriage counseling. q. i have been a widow for seven years. after grieving for a while, i joined a singles club and met a man who was fun to be around. i started dating him, and we had a lot in common. my problem is that this man has a napoleon complex: he needs other women around him.he is always out helping other single women with auto and home projects. when we are out together in local clubs, he leaves me sitting by myself while he asks women sitting alone to dance. i am totally fed up and doubt if he will ever change. should i accept him as he is, or break up and find a better companion? down and out a. unless your guy has a hankering to invade switzerland, i don't think he has a napoleon complex. he sounds instead like a fun flirt. he will not change because he has no incentive to change. if you want a different outcome, you should choose a partner who won't engage you in a game of musical chairs. q. ""worried husband"" asked if it was ok to have a ""secret friendship"" with another woman. friendships help us get through life. one problem with our understanding of marriage is that it should be the ""be-all and end-all"" relationship. that is simply impossible. it's this wrong-headed belief that drives us to feel as if we must have ""secret"" relationships. if we can learn to develop honest relationships with our spouses (and our friends), we avoid the destructive baggage that comes with keeping secrets. your spouse doesn't need to know every single thing that you do or say or feel, but she/he does have the right to not be lied to. secrets, in the sense of this situation, are lies. sally a. i agree. thank you. send questions via e-mail to askamy@tribune.com or by mail to ask amy, chicago tribune, tt500, 435 n. michigan ave., chicago, il 60611.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QSKde0Pks3kjqjMS0qa2OMfERSyp3kY_&usp=drive_copy,N/A - not specified,0

"then an ambitious 13-part series produced for public radio about ordinary people struggling to live their spiritual values might come as a welcome antidote.  ""humankind"", which was produced at a small studio here and premieres in boston tomorrow at 3 p.m. on wbur (90.9 fm), profiles people from different walks of life striving in daily ways to make a difference.  in a time of widespread cynicism, ""humankind,"" the brainchild of award-winning documentary producer david freudberg, celebrates old-fashioned values - integrity, compassion, equality, and generosity.
¬† belmont - fed up with monica? weary of murder, fire, hurricanes, and endless other tragedies? ""i strongly believe people are looking for a clear articulation of ideals and values,"" said freudberg, 43, who has worked in public radio since he was a teenager in philadelphia.  ""i think it's a very dangerous thing for our society to have the degree of cynicism that i see as being almost pervasive,"" said freudberg. ""it's corrosive, and i have been thirsting for some way in which the media can responsibly provide another road.""  ""humankind"" includes the voices of a man who drives a truck delivering food to homeless shelters; a former reporter who started a summer camp in maine for israeli and arab children; and an elderly woman who each week rides two buses and a subway to pick up food at a food pantry for her friend who can't get around easily.  driving a delivery truck for a food charity is ""a blessing,"" herman manigo told freudberg in one episode, ""because i've been where a lot of these people are now.  ""i mean, you can survive being broke, but it's very difficult when you don't have food on the table for your kids, because they don't understand that. now i have a chance to give back and i wouldn't trade it in for nothing in the world.""  other ""humankind"" episodes highlight a hospice in north carolina where patients receive free care; the effects on personal discipline of fasting, and personal questions about how individuals choose to donate to charity.  the people freudberg profiles aren't saints. they are simply ordinary people motivated by a sense of decency that freudberg says he found moving and inspiring.  listen to jerry smith, a counselor at seeds of peace, the summer camp in otisfield, maine, for israeli and palestinian youth, talk about what happens when youngsters who are supposed to hate each other have a chance to play and talk with each other.  ""you can spend your whole life hating your enemy, but that one moment that you take to love your enemy and find a way to get past that hate really helps you move forward in your own life,"" said smith.  crisscrossing the country, speaking to dozens of people, freudberg said he found several overarching themes among many americans today.  one is a longing for a sense of community. a second is a desire to carve out ""quiet time"" to escape our frenetic lives. a third is a concern not only with what we do in our work lives, but how we do it.  a fourth theme freudberg heard repeatedly is that you get ""back so much more from giving than from receiving."" and, finally, the possibility that people in trouble can transform their lives.  freudberg met a vietnam war veteran tortured by memories of some of the things he was ordered to do during the war, who was able to exorcise his demons and overcome a drug addiction by joining a veteran's organization that builds health clinics in vietnam.  ""for me ideals are the direction that my compass points to,"" freudberg said. ""it's not necessarily that i'm going to get there, but it's the direction i need to head in order to progress."" check local listings for the dates and times of ""humankind"" in your area. more information on the program is available on the world wide web (http://humanmedia.org)  religion notes  shining the spotlight on an important interreligious issue, boston college, a jesuit institution, has launched the center for the study of the jewish and christian relationship.  pope john paul ii has made improving catholic-jewish relations a top priority.  in boston, catholic and jewish leaders have forged strong ties that have resulted in several initiatives - including how judaism is taught in catholic religion classes - to increase mutual understanding and tolerance. boston college, given its extensive theological resources, seemed the ""best local place"" to set up such a center, said ruth langner, assistant professor of jewish studies at the school.  beginning this fall, the center will offer two courses every semester dealing with catholic-jewish issues.  it kicks off a public lecture series monday at 7:30 p.m. at boston college with a talk by professor philip a. cunningham of notre dame college in manchestern.h., who will speak on ""telling the christian story in a post-supersessionist church."" for information, call 552-3880.  book notes: what makes one church thrive while another has empty pews? this is one of the questions the rev. stephen a. macchia, president of vision new england, an evangelical christian association, addresses in his new book, ""becoming a healthy church.""  in his new book, the rev. michael smith foster, associate judicial vicar for the archdiocese of boston, discusses one of the most controversial and, perhaps, least well understood topics in the roman catholic church - the annulment process. foster's book is entitled ""annulment: the wedding that was.""",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nk_CY6Ww0V86tLUp0nfvhqmoL8T8QrF5&usp=drive_copy,N/A - not specified,0
"olympic cycling champion tyler hamilton, who is facing a two-year doping ban, was dropped last week by his swiss-based racing team, which yesterday lost its license to compete on the professional tour. the 33-year-old marblehead native, who tested positive for banned blood transfusions at both the athens games in august and the tour of spain in september, earlier had been suspended by phonak pending resolution of his case.
but the scandal-ridden team, which has had two other star athletes test positive during the last four months, decided to cut hamilton loose with more than a year left on his six-figure contract in a last-ditch attempt to keep its license. ""after many discussions with team management, we concluded together that it would not be possible for the team to continue at the level we hoped with my name on the roster,"" hamilton said in a statement after the international cycling union booted phonak plus a french and a belgian team from the pro circuit, which includes the tour de france. hamilton, who repeatedly has denied using transfusions, was allowed to keep his olympic time trial medal because his blood test was ruled ""inconclusive"" after the lab inadvertently destroyed his backup sample. the usanti-doping agency, which has jurisdiction over the spanish doping case, will hold a hearing in january. ""i am very sad the challenges i face personally have had such a wide-ranging impact on so many,"" hamilton said. ""on behalf of everyone involved, i am more committed than ever to getting to the bottom of all this.""¬†",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nLlJVrZBboIWtN15TTLfchg9vSpKYG99/view,N/A - not specified,0
"mayor menino yesterday effectively quashed boston university president john silber's publicly expressed hope to succeed departing school superintendent lois harrison-jones, saying he has ""serious questions"" whether silber could do a good job. in an interview that coincided with the final day of harrison-jones' stormy four-year tenure, the mayor finally expressed his opinion on silber's open pursuit of the position. menino, while acknowledging that the system is a boat that needs to be rocked, said with a laugh that silber might well ""blow up the boat."" as silber's prospects all but vanished, sources said that milton school superintendent mary grassa o'neill, a former boston zone superintendent who is credited with making dramatic improvements in milton, has emerged as a serious contender for the job.
menino declined to confirm the reports, saying he is unaware of what candidates his search committee will recommend. but he said of grassa o'neill: ""i love her. i think she's great."" when grassa o'neill was about to leave boston for the milton job in 1993, menino recalled, he made efforts to try to get harrison-jones to keep her in boston. neither silber nor grassa o'neill could be reached for comment yesterday. as silber approaches his 69th birthday amid plans to relinquish the bu presidency, his second career has been very much in the news. first, he said he was ""intrigued"" with the notion of taking harrison-jones' job. then, a week ago, he told globe columnist david nyhan, ""there is nothing i'd rather do right now."" gov. weld, who vanquished silber in their bitter fight for the governor's office in 1990, has also become something of a booking agent for silber's next career, first seeking to recruit a reluctant silber for a high-level post overseeing the state's public education system, as the globe reported on wednesday, and also boosting his name for the boston job. in the interview, menino expressed his personal admiration for the bu president, said silber has ""good ideas,"" and noted his unwavering and early support for silber's 1990 gubernatorial candidacy. but, as he has since silber's name surfaced, the mayor at first sought to sidestep the question of silber's candidacy. asked if silber was a viable candidate, the mayor shot back: ""he hasn't applied. . . . so he's not a viable candidate. if he's interested in the job, he should apply for it. that's how this process works."" but, when pressed as to whether the autocratic silber would make a good superintendent, menino replied: ""i have some questions about that. i have some serious questions about that. i have questions about john silber's ability to deal with the diversity, to deal with a lot of the issues."" the position, menino added, ""takes a special person,"" and not just someone who will rock the boat. after suggesting silber might ""blow up"" the school system, menino asked: "". . . can he deal with the constituencies you have to deal with to run the school system? i'm very curious. i think it would be difficult for him. i think it would be very difficult."" since silber first suggested he wanted the job, the mayor's aides have privately voiced skepticism about the volatile bu president. after menino appeared to dash silber's hopes yesterday, one of the mayor's advisers said: ""the new school superintendent will not be the final and total authority on the boston school system. there is great reason to believe that john silber cannot function in that context."" grassa o'neill, who won a citywide reputation for innovation, first as a middle school principal and then as one of boston's three zone superintendents, was passed over for the superintendent's job in 1990, in part because she was not a favorite of the former elected school committee. it has since been replaced by an appointed body menino now controls. menino was acting mayor when grassa o'neill left the boston system for milton. ""i tried to get the business community to get lois to just call mary grassa o'neill and tell her, is she part of the team or not part of the team? i was trying to get lois to just give her an answer. she had the woman hanging out there for two years,"" menino said. ""the problem is a lot of good people have left the system,"" menino said, recalling that at a recent meeting at the city-owned parkman house, there were ""three principals who had left boston sitting there and they said, 'tommy, we'll come back to boston immediately if we have an opportunity, because we find boston has a lot of good things happening in the schools.' "" menino said he expects a list of three to five finalists from his nine-member search committee by mid-july. he declined to say whether grassa o'neill's name will make the list. ""i trust people's judgment that they will bring the best candidates to me,"" menino said. but he added: ""do you think i would put people on the search committee who don't reflect my principles on the schools?""",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EYWP4Cz4YcdRQTGP6PkEtN1jclhDCbJc/view,N/A - not specified,0
"washington - americans increased their spending more slowly in march, suggesting some are worried that their paychecks aren't growing quickly enough. the commerce department said monday that consumer spending increased just 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.9 percent in february.
income grew 0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in february, but after-tax income when adjusted for inflation increased just 0.2 percent in march. the gain followed two months of declines. consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, rose 2.9 percent in the january-march quarter - the fastest pace in more than a year. the increase was a bright spot in an otherwise weak first quarter for economic growth. but paul dales, senior us economist at capital economics, noted that stronger spending in january and february drove the quarterly increase. and consumers spent more while saving less, which suggests they cannot sustain their spending pace without better pay. ""real incomes will need to grow at a faster rate to prevent consumption growth from slowing,"" dales said. he noted that friday's report on april hiring is a crucial sign of where the economy is headed. the government reported friday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the january-march quarter. that's down from 3 percent annual growth in the october-december period. the weakness mainly reflected government budget-cutting and weaker business investment. in march, consumers spent 0.9 percent more on nondurable goods, such as clothing. spending on durable goods, such as cars and appliances, fell 0.3 percent. spending on services such as utilities and rent was mostly flat. an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in march. over the past 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the federal reserve's 2 percent inflation target after-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months compared with a year earlier. that was the smallest pay increase in two years. the savings rate edged up to 3.8 percent in march, after dropping to a 30-month low of 3.7 percent of after-tax income in february. a healthy job market could reinvigorate consumers. but the economy created just 120,000 jobs - half the pace of the previous three months. economists predict employers added 163,000 jobs this month, slightly better than march's figures but below the pace from december through february. one positive change since the winter: gas prices appear to have peaked. that would give consumers more to spend elsewhere. the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $3.81 on monday, down 8 cents from a month ago, according to aaa's fuel gauge report.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nkpHmV6jnWpHX7OmWocNrfsElcJzwReT/view,N/A - not specified,0
"friends and foes agree on this much about stephen p. tocco: the man sure can make trouble, but he knows how to make nice. after sparring and nearly reaching the point of no return with a challenger, the chairman of the state board of higher education is known to flash his impish smile, let loose his low-key humor, and deflate explosive situations of his own making. ""i was livid,"" said representative kevin murphy, house chairman of the joint committee on higher education, who said tocco blindsided him last fall by publicly rolling out a financial aid proposal without consulting him. ""but he said he wanted a heart-to-heart. when our meeting was over, i said, `this is a guy i can work with.' "" now, as tocco, 59, seeks to win the chairmanship of the university of massachusetts board of trustees, the question is whether his aggressive style would propel umass-amherst into a top-flight flagship or bog down the board in one-upmanship and recriminations.
tocco vies for the spot amid controversy. he says he has the votes to unseat karl white , the chairman, at a special meeting set for thursday, but others say his election pushed by governor mitt romney is not a fait accompli. tocco, whose style has made him a go-to man in successive republican administrations, says he must act as a consensus builder to be successful among the 19 voting members on the umass board. but during an interview in his 41st-floor office in downtown boston, tocco said he is prepared to do battle to fulfill romney's mandate to elevate the profile of umass-amherst by improving its campus and its national rankings. ""umass-amherst becomes the brand of the public system,"" tocco said. critics, higher education officials who would talk only off the record about their concerns, say tocco's plan could put the five campuses, which now act like miniempires, on a collision course. while some say that tocco owes his ascension to the umass board to his close political ties to romney, others contend that tocco has become well-versed in higher education policy in the seven years he has headed the state board of higher education. state officials and educators credit him for pushing through key initiatives, including improving state and community college graduation rates. the initiative initially met with resistance, but college officials say tocco was dogged and eventually swayed college leaders. state college graduation rates in the past three years have gone from 44 percent to 49 percent. ""there has been tension between tocco and the president of the institutions,"" said dana mohler-faria, president of bridgewater state college. ""but it was the sort of tension that caused the system to move forward."" robert antonucci, president of fitchburg state college, put it this way: ""steve is steve. he's upfront, he's honest. sometimes he may step on toes, but to get the system moving, you can't be a fly on the wall."" tocco says the clash over graduation rates was necessary. ""the college presidents said i was supposed to be their advocate,"" he said. ""i said, `i can't be an advocate if i don't believe in the product.' "" tocco grew up in malden and later reading, the son of a milk delivery man and stay-at-home mother. the oldest of five children, tocco was an avid athlete at reading high school and carried himself with an intense demeanor, his siblings recall. ""god love him,"" said mary cookson, his sister. ""he was never afraid to take the bull by the horns."" tocco earned a bachelor of science in pharmacy and chemistry from the massachusetts college of pharmacy in 1969, although tocco says he never intended to make a career in pharmacy. he developed an interest in public policy in 1976 when he campaigned for his childhood friend, edward j. markey, as he sought his first term in congress. tocco soon after began running markey's district office. ""steve was a natural leader,"" markey said. ""he could take any issue and work with people to try to reach consensus."" in 1980, tocco left politics to head associated builders and contractors, a trade association. eleven years later, he returned to politics as a senior aide to governor william f. weld, who, a year later, named tocco secretary of economic affairs. in 1993, weld tapped him to head the massachusetts port authority, where he stayed for four years, and clashed with then-senate president william m. bulger over how a sports and convention center would be paid for and designed. in 1997, he joined an international trade unit of the law firm mintz levin cohn ferris glovsky and popeo, and two years later, became head of the firm's lobbying arm, ml strategies, after its merger with the trade unit, the same year he was tapped to head the state board of higher education to critics, tocco's dual role, as higher education czar and head of a lobbying firm of a law firm that touts higher education as a specialty, is a collision of interests. ""a person in that position has to be able to stand up and advocate for the wishes of the university against the wishes of the governor and the legislature, and i don't know if you can do that if you are in the position that steve tocco is in as president of ml strategies,"" said james karam, the umass board of trustees chairman who was ousted by romney this month. umass trustees oversee a budget of $2.1 billion. tocco says he has sought to avoid conflicts of interest and has recused himself from board of higher education votes that awarded his law firm work as legal counsel to umass as it secured financing for construction. tocco does not register as a lobbyist because he says he runs ml strategies, but does not lobby on its clients' behalf. he said ml strategies, which has five registered lobbyists, does not represent any institutions of higher education. state records show the firm represented boston university in 2004, but tocco says it no longer does. tocco declined to provide a client list. ""he doesn't have a self-interested agenda,"" said robert o'leary of the cape and islands, who is the senate chair of the joint committee on higher education. ""he really is an advocate for the system."" tocco still lives in reading with his wife, cynthia bouthot tocco, who works for the british consulate, and has three grown children. in his spare time, he said, he plays golf in reading. but he says that time is limited: there is always background reading. tocco says he's gearing up for clashes anew if he wins control of the board. ""disagreement is healthy,"" he said.

"president beji caid essebsi said the bardo museum attack involved three men, one of whom escaped. tunis ‚Äî a third attacker in the deadly assault on the bardo museum is on the run, tunisia's president said sunday, declaring his country at war with the extremists who killed 21 people at one of north africa's most revered cultural institutions.
president beji caid essebsi said the attack involved ""three aggressors"" and the third person escaped. he was speaking live with french network itele from inside the museum, its elaborate tilework visible behind him. tunisia's interior ministry released security camera footage of wednesday's attack showing two gunmen walking through the museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. at one point they encounter a third man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. they briefly acknowledge each other before walking in opposite directions. police responding to the attack shot and killed the two gunmen. they were identified as tunisians in their 20s who had trained in libya. essebsi said the extremists who have recruited about 3,000 tunisians to fight in iraq and syria have no credible link to islamic belief. he said his country was at war with them. ""when war is brought upon us, we will wage war,"" he said. spanish tourist josep lluis cusido said he never got a clear look at the men shooting their way across the bardo museum as he hid behind a pillar. but he noticed that the attacker closest to him seemed young. cusido, mayor of the spanish town of vallmoll, will never know for certain but the man who stood a few yards away was probably 20-year-old yassine laabidi ‚Äî the younger of the two attackers. ""they looked to see how they could inflict the most damage possible. i saw one group who was in the museum who took refuge in a room .¬†.¬†. they went in there and machine gunned them all,"" cusido said saturday, stifling a sob. after breakfast wednesday, laabidi left home to go to his job making deliveries for a local business, his father arbi said in their home in el omrane, an area on the outskirts of tunis. later that day he joined 26-year-old hatem khachnaoui and shot 21 people to death at the renowned museum ‚Äî including a tunisian security agent who had recently become a father ‚Äî before being killed in a shootout with security forces. in el omrane ‚Äî a poor neighborhood that has proved fertile ground for jihadi recruiters ‚Äî a mourning tent went up outside the laabidi home.

"It's expected that virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019.Left: Powerbeats3 from Dr. Dre's Beats. Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

"gerhard lauck works hard to dispel people's assumptions about neo-nazis: he laughs frequently, makes self-effacing jokes and stresses that he promotes only nonviolent change. ""i'm just a big, kind, lovable teddy bear,"" he insists. civil rights and law enforcement officials around the world, particularly in germany, describe this american citizen in other terms: as an evil, dangerous provocateur. they say, and lauck agrees, that he is the no. 1 producer of neo-nazi propaganda distributed in germany, where even the possession of such material is outlawed. indeed, after quietly producing his wares for two decades in america's heartland, lauck is being thrust into an international spotlight by the post-reunification surge of neo-nazi activity in germany, and his role in promoting it.
lauck, during a two-hour interview near his home outside lincoln, maintained that his mission was just to help white people understand their interest in installing a fourth reich through electoral means. but german authorities say that his efforts have been anything but democratic, and that they fueled racial hatred and fomented violence. for instance, they said inflammatory stickers, newspapers and other materials traced to lauck were found during investigations of more than 70 hate crimes in 1991. and his influence, by all accounts, has mushroomed. while his background is somewhat sketchy, it is known that in 1972, lauck, at age 19, founded the national socialist german workers party-overseas organization, which has an estimated membership of fewer than 500 in this country. with the exception of the last two words, the group's name is identical to that of adolf hitler's nazi party. lauck subsequently engaged in a host of neo-nazi activities in the united states and abroad, but he has become most successful publishing a newspaper called ""the new order,"" printed in 10 languages. it includes virulent attacks on minority groups and jews. it features ads for nazi literature, tapes and cassettes of hitler's speeches, and it offers suggestions on how to smuggle such material into countries that prohibit its existence on their soil. fbi director louis freeh promised last month during a trip to germany to crack down on us purveyors of neo-nazi writings and paraphernelia. he did not cite lauck by name, but officials in both countries said in interviews that he was the chief target of freeh's vow. the officials acknowledged that pinning lauck down for a specific crime may prove difficult, however, since he and others often operate from this country expressly because of its constitutional protections. ""the problem is that his activities are not illegal in the united states,"" said susanne karkowski of the bundesamt fur verfassungsschutz, the german equivalent of the fbi. ""it's not for nothing that he operates from somewhere where he finds himself in a legal nirvana."" lauck does not reveal the location of his printing presses or the identities of his coworkers (""they have wives and children""). armed with the first amendment, he generally wages his international battles from close to home. he also sells his products domestically, but us officials dismiss his activities here as insignificant compared with their impact in germany and, to a lesser extent, in the splintered states of the former soviet union. ""it's one thing for this material to be distributed in new york, where there's so much of this kind of stuff and people are used to fringe politics, for example, but it's another thing for lauck's propaganda to act as virtually a match in the tinderboxes of central and eastern europe,"" said tom halperin, who along with irwin suall is director of fact-finding for the anti-defamation league of b'nai b'rith. dressed neatly in dark gray slacks, light gray sportcoat, white shirt and gray-striped tie, lauck repeatedly sought during an interview last week to stress a preference for nonviolence. the bloodthirsty images that the ""jewish-dominated media"" and ""germany's dictatorship"" seek to create, he said, are false and distorted. as if to underline his point, lauck presented even his most strident views in moderate tones, laced his comments with historical and literary references, and projected an affable persona. but the examples he cited of his good intentions belied the self-image he sought to project. he said he promoted force, for instance, only as a last resort to ""deprive jews of power"" and to get them to live in isolation. ""we could dictate terms before taking action,"" he suggested. ""if you will cease and desist from trying to subvert western civilization and exterminating the white race, then we can make a truce. . . . i don't care if we sit down and talk to these people or if we exterminate them, but i'd prefer to talk."" likewise, although he would like to segregate blacks in a country of their own, he said he would first try to do so through negotiation, because he felt sympathy for them. ""it's like, i love my dog, too,"" he said. ""i don't beat my dog, and i feed him . . . but i don't give him equal rights or have sex with him."" even on key questions such as inducing poland to cede land to germany, lauck tried to offer clever solutions. ""we'll offer to bribe them, give them economic aid, which they'll take,"" he said, "". . . because we'll also tell them if you don't do this, we'll invade you and take back the territory and massacre you."" groups that monitor extremists - such as the anti-defamation league, the simon weisenthal center and the southern poverty law center - have tracked lauck for most of the 20 years he has been in the propaganda business. the fbi and the justice department's civil rights division have extensive files on him, according to officals of both agencies. as evidenced by the fact that he is still in business, dealing with extremists like lauck raises nettlesome legal, constitutional and ethical issues. john kundts of the fbi said ""it's more complex than a murder case or even a white-collar crime"" to determine how the self-styled propagandist can be prosecuted, since his operations are legal. but critics such as aaron breitbart, senior researcher at the wiesenthal center, pointed out that other democracies find ""it's perfectly legitimate to regulate freedom of expression at the point where, as with lauck, it leads to attacks and violence."" moreover, breitbart and others maintain that news organizations that write about neo-nazis may do some good by exposing their activities, but simultaneously provide their subjects with free publicity. on that count, at least, lauck agrees with his detractors. ""if you print an article in boston, mass., or any major city with a race problem, saying there's a guy publishing stickers that say 'deport niggers,' and he's in lincoln, neb., even if everything else says i'm a total monster or a total nut or a total lunatic - when i'm only 95 percent of those things - there will be people who want some of those stickers and write for literature,"" he said. ""then you get more literature in the field, and you get more support, you get more subscribers."" lauck was born in milwaukee in 1953 to parents of german ancestry, moved to lincoln as a child and began reading books such as hitler's ""mein kampf"" in his early teens. he said he skipped his senior year of high school, then concentrated on german-related courses during two years at the university of nebraska. at about age 17, gary rex lauck adopted the name gerhard ""for ethnic identification,"" and later apparently assumed something like a german accent and grew a mustache trimmed much like hitler's. lauck denied he affects an accent, saying his ""distinctive voice"" comes from having lived in milwaukee or having listened to german-speaking grandparents. while he portrays himself as relatively reasonable and said he was accepted by his parents and two siblings despite his views, police records paint a different picture. they show he was arrested in february 1978 for shooting his brother jerry, apparently after an argument about lauck's activities. jerry lauck survived, left the state and declined to press charges. lauck closely guards his activities, and german officals also do not like to discuss them. but sources said he routinely has used the us mail, often sending nondescript packages to phony post-office boxes, and also smuggled tons of material in the trunks of cars traveling over the german border from adjoining nations. he has been arrested in germany three times: in 1972 for distributing nazi literature, in 1974 for delivering a speech about ""why hitler is still so popular in the united states"" and in 1976 for toting around 20,000 nazi stickers. after serving 4 1/2 months in jail on that last charge, he was expelled from germany for life, although he was allowed back in 1979 to testify at a trial.  in the interview, lauck said he also has sneaked into the country several times since but prefers to meet with collaborators in neighboring nations. suall, of the anti-defamation league, was among several us officials who expressed hope that newfound fbi interest in lauck might finally lead to legal action against him.  ""this is a guy who provides ammunition to the most hateful kinds of people and, worse, influences young people,"" said suall.

the concert opened with two solos by soll herself, reinforcing her reputation as an extraordinarily compelling, articulate performer. ``disclosure'' (2010) was a powerful portrayal of an aging diva. with her turbaned head and gathered satiny skirt, soll was an elegant norma desmond type, reliving moments from a storied life in and out of the spotlight. as she walked, ran, lunged and skittered about the stage, gestures evoked a panoply of emotions. hands framed her face, clutching, covering. one arm cocked behind the head in a glamour shot. arms raised upward in a great curve, as if basking in applause, then dropped dramatically, casting it all aside. her period gazes to the audience were unnervingly direct. yet at one point, she fell, scrabbling backward and shielding her eyes from a bright sidelight, as if fleeing fame's glare. repeatedly she engaged, walking toward us resolutely before turning her back and taking a few steps away, as if she couldn't quite make the break with her adoring fans. ``tribute,'' given its world premiere, seemed almost a kind of prequel, though more internal and set to a flurry of spoken phrases, fractured and flowing forth in a variety of languages. she rushed onstage, adjusting the red belt of her dark gray coveralls, huffing ``i'm so tired, uno momento.'' she seemed to be talking more to herself than to us, urging, reassuring, censoring herself through bursts of activity with flourishes of dramatic gestures. it was like watching the process of creation. ``yes, no, basta'' she conversed with herself. ``ok. here goes'' launched a little hoochie-coochie dance, hips waggling side to side. ``just watch this'' ushered in slavic folk dance. it was riveting, humorous, and touching as she vaulted from moment to moment in a kind of creative frenzy. ``restless geometry'' (2010) was much less coherent. a work for seven dancers set to music from the 17th and 18th centuries juxtaposed with the sounds of frogs, crickets, birds, and wolves, it seemed to suggest how quickly civility can dissolve into savagery. balletic tendus and courtly bows cast in symmetrical patterns were subverted by chaotic runs and falls. ``life is a game. let's play,'' one of the dancers suggested, setting up freeze tag, catch, blind man's bluff. odd man out was accompanied by gossipy whispers, the fun taking on an edge of malice. the music invited dance, but most rhythmic phrases got quickly skewed by melodrama. at one point, the dancers dropped to their knees, hands behind their backs. they mimed taking turns beheading one another, then fell into nurturing embraces. in the end, one lone dancer costumed in green was encircled by the others. to the sound of frogs croaking, he curled on the floor, then slowly crawled forward to arise upright, as if to remind us we've all emerged from the swamp. karen campbell can be reached at karencampbell4@rcn.com dance review beth soll & company at: dance complex, saturday night",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nw_s0gU0bUU9uir2uYWrBpBBxsnjXCT6/view,N/A - not specified,0

"The St. John's Prep hockey team took the ice at Essex Sports Center on Friday afternoon with its fate on the end of its sticks. With a 3-5-2 start, the Eagles were a long shot for Super 8 consideration. But a red-hot second half to the season gave Prep new life. Squaring off with Catholic Conference foe Xaverian in Middleton, the Eagles skated to a hard-fought 3-2 victory, making a final statement that they deserve to be in the conversation when the Division 1A Committee meets Saturday morning in Franklin.
""We knew the importance of this week for us, with Braintree [on Wednesday] and Xaverian,"" coach Kristian Hanson said after the win. ""We felt that we put ourselves in a good situation to get a play-in game."" The Eagles (11-7-2, 2-5-1 Catholic Conference) got out to an early lead with a pair of first-period goals from freshman Brian Carrabes and senior Kyle Hentosh, but Xaverian (10-7-3, 1-5-2 Catholic) came back strong in the second. Sophomore Josh Barton cut into the Prep lead just two minutes into the second, and sophomore Ryan Doo netted a shorthanded goal to tie the score at 8:59 of the period. The Eagles have proven to be nothing if not resilient this season, however, and bounced back with a power-play goal off the stick off senior forward Billy Fairweather late in the period to regain the lead. In the third, Prep killed off two Xaverian power plays and held on, keeping its Super 8 dreams alive. ""The kids just battled the entire game,"" Hanson said. After their slow start, the Eagles won eight of their final 10 games, capped by a six-game winning streak to end the season. Hanson reflected on his team's tough start, as the Eagles dropped four one-goal games to teams ranked in the Globe's top 10. He said he believes his team's late-season push and strength of schedule should be enough to earn a spot in a play-in game. ""It took us some time to develop some chemistry,"" Hanson said. ""We have seven losses on the season, and not one of those is against a team that won't be in the Super 8.""

"the red saab turns sharply around the corner into leonard morse hospital, almost hitting helen moore as she tries to hand the driver a leaflet. for moore, the incident seems fitting. as a veteran nurse at the hospital, she feels as if she is under assault. rumors about layoffs are in the air. and nurses worry that the hospital's plan for a new ""patient care model"" is nothing more than a ploy to replace them with cheaper labor. ""we're the ones who built this hospital,"" moore said as she joined other nurses at an informational picket line last week. ""now they want to let us go.""
like the other players in medicine, nurses are learning that they are not immune from the financial ills of the health care system. just a few years after they were being recruited to a recession-proof career with promises of big pay increases, nurses are encountering a very different world. boston university hospital and the brigham & women's hospital announced nursing layoffs recently, although there is still a chance that the cutbacks might be avoided. beth israel and deaconess hospitals have asked nurses to defer scheduled raises to save costs. at a number of hospitals, contract talks with nurses have dragged on for months, with the the two sides unable to agree on issues of pay and job security. picket lines are cropping up in front of hospitals like spring flowers. and the hard times are hitting just as the clinton administration is talking about expanding the role of nursing. in the reform plan that's due out next month, nurses may be asked to take on primary care duties that once were the domain of doctors. all of that may happen. in the meantime, nurses are nervous about the future. ""it's hard to be objective about change when you think your job may disappear,"" said therese smaha, a specialist in nursing issues for the massachusetts hospital association.  nurses are feeling the squeeze after a period of tremendous gains. in the 1980s and early 1990s, their ranks grew rapidly, and so did their paychecks. the average salary of a registered hospital nurse climbed from $ 26,000 in 1987 to $ 42,000 in 1992, according to the massachusetts hospital association.  in the peak years of 1988 and 1989, nursing salaries rose more than 15 percent a year. a nurse at a major boston teaching hospital can make more than $ 65,000 a year. salaries are lower at smaller hospitals, and considerably lower in nursing homes.  nurses have benefited from the law of supply and demand. a nursing shortage in the middle and late 1980s forced hospitals to bid wages up to attract more nurses. some hospitals offered prizes, like trips to bermuda and vcrs, for tips that led to the hiring of a nurse.  capitalism worked. nursing school enrollment soared, former nurses returned to work and the vacancy rate at hospitals dropped sharply. ""the nursing shortage doesn't exist anymore,"" said thomas lynch, executive vice president at newton-wellesley hospital.  instead, a patient shortage has developed. a combination of improved technology and steady pressure from health insurers has cut both admissions and lengths of stay at most massachusetts hospitals. boston university hospital, for instance, had more than 89,000 patient days in 1991. this year, the hospital expects to have just over 85,000. ""nurses will scoff at that and say they are busier than ever, but the facts don't bear them out,"" said maura mitchell, the hospital's vice president for nursing. the hospital plans to lay off about two dozen nurses, unless the union agrees to give up pay increases.  hospitals looking to cut expenses aren't ignoring nursing. at a typical hospital, nursing salaries and benefits can easily amount to 20 percent of total costs.  so far, most hospitals are trying to avoid layoffs by holding the line on wage increases. both newton-wellesley and faulkner hospital in boston have proposed not giving cost-of-living increases to nurses. instead, they would get a one-time bonus and normal pay increases for seniority. at several hospitals, management is trying to eliminate special weekend programs that were created during the shortage years. thus, nurses willing to work 12 hours on saturday and sunday are paid for a 36-hour week, and the hospitals say the incentive is costly and no longer necessary. the massachusetts nurses association, which represents nurses at many local hospitals, says giving it up would cause a hardship. more contentious than money issues are those of job security. specifically worrisome, nurses say, is the growing use of nurse technicians, another vestige of the shortage era. when nurses were hard to find, some hospitals began hiring lower-paid technicians to perform routine duties - giving baths, taking temperature and blood pressure - that don't require true nursing skills. the technicians take an 8- or 10-week training course at the hospital and are paid about $ 10 an hour; top-scale nurses can make more than $ 30 an hour in boston. ""they aren't there to help us, but to replace us,"" karen higgins said last week as she led a picket line of nurses outside boston university hospital. higgins and her colleagues marched in front of the hospital carrying signs that read: ""nurses are the solution, not the problem,"" and, ""who is caring for you?"" the nurses at bu hospital say it is continuing to hire technicians even as nurses are being laid off. they say further that the use of the technicians, who are unlicensed, compromises the quality of patient care. ""they can't replace us at the bedside with people who have minimal experience,"" higgins said. the hospital denies that care has suffered, or that technicians are replacing nurses. the number of technicians has grown only modestly over the past two years, according to a hospital executive. at other hospitals, administrators say technicians and others who are not nurses will play a bigger role, and that over time, the number of nurses in a given hospital will decline. ""nurses have to identify the tasks that don't require their level of expertise and give up those tasks to others,"" said judy miller, senior vice president for patient-care services at new england deaconess. such a strategy, miller said, will save money and free up nurses to work on the more interesting and satisfying part of nursing.  both metrowest medical center in framingham and winchester hospital are moving to new models of care that use nurses more sparingly. they insist the changes are not a threat to nursing, but they make no bones about the fact that efficiency is one of their goals. ""we have to recognize that our resources are limited,"" said ruth stark, director of public relations at metrowest. nurses are not defense workers or steelworkers. demand for their services is not going to disappear. even as jobs get cut in hospitals, new ones will open up in clinics, home health care and health maintenance organizations. nearly all labor market surveys predict that employment in nursing will continue to grow for the rest of the decade. those who are bullish about nursing's future see nurses moving up, performing more demanding and professional tasks. ""once we go through a transition period, nursing will have a stronger role,"" said judy miller of the deaconess. perhaps. but for now, nurses must cope with rising insecurity. ""i was going to retire at my hospital in 32 years,"" said a young nurse who lost her job recently at a boston teaching hospital. finding a new job is not that easy now, she said. finding one at a comparable salary may be impossible. back at the picket line at leonard morse, helen moore is worried. she hands leaflets to anyone who will take them.  several nurses standing nearby hold up red, white and blue balloons. one carries a sign that says, ""honk for nurses."" the hospital merged with framingham hospital last year to form metrowest medical center. to moore and others, the merger looks more like a takeover. one department, pediatrics, has already moved to framingham. others could follow, she said. moore has worked at leonard morse for 20 years. when she started, nurses were paid $ 4 an hour; top pay today is nearly $ 23 an hour. ""finally we are making not great money, but a fair income,"" she said. ""we don't want to lose that."" her words are drowned out by the honking of a horn from a passing truck. encouraged, moore smiles and goes back to the picket line.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_uGpdiZrY9jYvWw2aK5YNfpwP_68CuL/view,N/A - not specified,0
"A Jeep Wagoneer, believed to be from the 1960s, was pulled from the shed in two pieces. For decades, nature took its course. As the Cape Cod sand dune continued to shift with the rolling ocean tides and high winds, it overwhelmed the wooden shed where the white Jeep Wagoneer had been parked, all but burying it. And there it stayed for roughly 40 years ‚Äî until Friday.
The aged vehicle was plucked this week from its unintended burial plot along Ballston Beach in Truro using a front-end loader and a chain. The Jeep, believed to be a model from the 1960s, was removed so the town can begin work ripping up a portion of an adjacent public parking lot at the popular beach, where the dune has started to encroach. Rather than fight back to preserve parking, the town is going to allow the dune to ""continue to move the way it wants to,"" said Emily Beebe, Truro's assistant health and conservation agent. ""It became important to get rid of this Jeep,"" she said. ""The town is going to be moving sand off of the east side of the Ballston Beach parking lot and, once the pavement is uncovered, removing pavement and restoring the sand."" The town and homeowner had talked about how to best remove the vehicle over the years, officials said. But because a coastal dune is a natural resource area under the Wetlands Protection Act, difficulty kept mounting. With the town ready to move ahead as soon as Monday with its project, removing the Jeep took on a new sense of urgency. ""It's not an easy process. But we walked them through it,"" Beebe said. ""[A Jeep] is not something you want to have in an area where you're going to have the ocean at some point washing in."" Witnessing the Jeep's removal may seem uninteresting, but it somehow captivated a national audience. This week, calls came in to Town Hall about the vehicle from as far away as Oregon, said Town Manager Rae Ann Palmer. Palmer was intrigued herself. She remembers seeing similar Jeeps cruising the streets as a kid. On Friday, as crews from Greg Morris Landscaping arrived at the private property and prepared to unearth it, Palmer stood nearby. Workers first peeled away the sunken shed's front doors, revealing the front-facing Jeep's smiling grille. A chain was attached to the loader and then wrapped around the vehicle's axle. With a groan and a crunch, the old vehicle was wrestled out of the garage. In the end, it arrived in two pieces. ""It was fascinating,"" said Palmer. ""They opened the garage, and it was like watching a time capsule being opened."" She added, ""as they started pulling it, you just see this rising of this Jeep, kind of coming up and out, and [the contractor] pulled it out and dropped it and it was this bucket of rust."" Among the heaps of metal, however, were relics of a bygone era still in decent condition. The steering wheel was intact, the pale-green dashboard was visible, and the hubcaps were still relatively shiny. Morris, the contractor hired to move the Jeep, said the homeowner's family made off with a few trinkets. ""It was a piece of history,"" he said. ""It's all taken away now.""

"kerafast helps research teams find biologic materials they need, like the cell culture at right. chinchilla tissue samples millions of tiny tubes of cells, proteins, antibodies, and other scientific goo sit in freezers at research institutions across the country. these leftovers of past lab experiments can languish for years, frozen and forgotten. now a boston company called kerafast inc. is helping institutions clean out their freezers and reuse biological materials for new research through an online marketplace, a sort of craigslist for biologists. since kerafast began its service in 2010, more than 2,000 researchers around the world have used the company's website to search the freezers of 112 research institutions, buying unique biologic materials created in experiments by other scientists.
annie huhn, a research fellow at dana-farber cancer institute, recently spent $250 for a line of cells on kerafast that helped her with her work studying proteins. ""they have materials that you're definitely not going to find anywhere else,"" huhn said. robert p. bondaryk, a biochemist by training and veteran of the biotech industry, hatched the idea for kerafast six years ago. ""this is gold in freezers that many institutions are sitting on,"" said bondaryk, the company's chief executive. ""let's take what's in their freezers and make money from it."" a year after its launching, kerafast had signed up 10 institutions. this summer, the company hit a milestone when it enrolled its 100th research institution, adding to a list that includes boston children's hospital, massachusetts institute of technology, the university of massachusetts, and harvard university. most of the biologic concoctions kerafast sells look like clear liquids to the naked eye. but scientists see much more: raw materials for research that could lay the groundwork for discoveries of life-changing drugs to treat cancer, alzheimer's, and many other debilitating diseases. the products offered on kerafast's website are divided into different research areas, such as cancer, stem cells, immunology, and neurobiology. click on cancer, and you get a list of dozens of ""featured products"" ‚Äî myriad varieties of cells, antibodies, and more ‚Äîfor sale. each item comes with a short description that includes the name of the scientist who created it. prices range from $65 to more than $6,000 per product. the average order is about $500. kerafast ships the products quickly, packed in dry ice, from one lab to another, sometimes around the world. thomas fazzio, assistant professor of molecular medicine at umass medical school in worcester, needed a certain type of antibody, a protein the immune system produces to fight harmful substances, for his work with stem cells. he contacted a lab in california, but did not hear back for weeks. he did not want to try developing the antibodies on his own, because the process would have taken months and cost thousands of dollars. a google search led fazzio to the kerafast website, where he found the material he needed for about $300. ""we can buy it one day and get it the next day, as opposed to begging somebody else for it,"" fazzio said. kerafast splits its sales revenues with the research institutions that supply its inventory. bondaryk initially established the company as a nonprofit, with a mission to provide a new source of revenue for institutions at a time when federal support for research was waning. but he switched to a for-profit model because it allows kerafast to charge more for products and allow research institutions and the company to earn more. kerafast handles all the administrative work required to sell its products, including the legal agreements, which are necessary because the biologic materials are considered intellectual property. this is helpful especially f or smaller research institutions, such as brandeis university in waltham, where staff do not have the time or resources to seek out new homes for their surplus materials. ""we're a really small tech-transfer office. i don't want to get bogged down in red tape,"" said rebecca menapace, associate provost at brandeis. bondaryk estimates there are as many as 1 billion tubes of bioresearch materials sitting in freezers across the united states. every day, he tries to add a few more of these materials to his website, where scientists can access them. ""our approach is to take any material and try it out,"" bondaryk said.

"fresh off punching their ticket to the ncaa tournament, the boston university basketball team gathered at a restaurant near agganis arena to watch yesterday's selection show, anxious to learn its seeding, opponent, and destination.

"music review sarah brightman at: the td banknorth garden, monday night for a former stage actress who likes to get gussied up like tinkerbell, engage in faux synchronized swimming routines, and pretend bicycle-ride through sinister forests straight out of tolkien, you would think sarah brightman would have more of a sense of humor. or sparkling charisma. or at least some sort of discernible personality.
but monday night at the td banknorth garden, the petite british diva was all business, focused on only two things: singing and costume changes. the former was incredibly impressive, as brightman hit glorious highs, belted out robust lows, and mixed up a variety of styles from light opera to pop over the course of the two act, hour-and-45-minute performance. it was all super-serious, full of portentous - and loud - synthesizers providing orchestral flourishes. but there was little variance in mood. a gauzy read of kansas's '70s hit ""dust in the wind"" received the same furrowed-brow treatment as the churning ""phantom of the opera"" and the soaring ""ave maria,"" an achingly beautiful duet with brawny-voiced tenor fernando lima from brightman's recent album, ""a winter symphony."" it was all perfectly pleasant yet strangely polite, like the pbs pledge-drive entertainment it will surely become. the fashion portion of the show was intermittently entertaining, with brightman burning through ball gowns and tutus and stilettos like a dress-up-happy 8-year-old. (although we wouldn't wish the bizarre antebellum hoop mini-skirt with 100-yard-train and lace-up fuchsia leggings on even the most desperate female impersonator.) apparently there was no room between hitting high c's and negotiating high heels for establishing a rapport with her audience of 4,173 - or with her cadre of backup dancers or the hard-working band hidden behind her whiz-bang stage set. brightman needn't channel cher to curry favor, but a smidge more interaction with the crowd - beyond a very proper thanks - or self-deprecation about her fairy princess persona would have warmed the proceedings considerably. perhaps brightman thought the imposing set - complete with an elaborate mirrored video screen capable of transmitting her picture-book 3-d backdrops - would distract from her own low-wattage stage moves, which consisted mainly of strutting down the extended runway, the occasional twirl in billowing skirts, and fluttering arm gestures. she also excelled at lying still on the floor as eight female dancers surrounded her, backstroking their way through routines that would've brought smiles to the faces of ziegfeld and esther williams.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L9bkTFEcwJ5bN8texmEvcJi8fFRAAlBP/view,N/A - not specified,0
"when vice president al gore's motorcade arrived at the sprawling hsi lai temple complex in southern california for a luncheon last year, his staff members openly described the event as a democratic ""fund-raiser,"" featuring party officials and asian-american contributors.  gore's own words and actions at the buddhist temple, witnessed by a globe reporter and described here for the first time, give credence to the vice president's assertion that while he knew there was a fund-raising component to the event, he viewed it more as a good-will visit with asian-american leaders.  although other party leaders warmed up the audience with political rhetoric, gore's remarks were non-partisan and restrained, markedly different from the biting one-liners he offered at another fund-raiser that evening in northern california.  at the hsi lai temple, gore spoke in personal terms of his acquaintance with hsing yun, the venerable master and leader of the temple and its growing worldwide congregation, and of the us tradition of tolerance for immigrant cultures. gore made no explicit pitch for contributions.
the hsi lai temple lunch will be featured when the senate campaign finance hearings resume today, with three nuns from the temple expected to testify that they served as conduits for tens of thousands of dollars of potentially illegal contributions from the church.  to defuse the controversy, gore's aides have mounted an aggressive defense of their boss - briefing reporters and releasing internal documents about the fund-raiser. after declining several requests during the past 15 months, gore's office agreed this week to release the globe from an off-the-record agreement that allowed this reporter to attend the fund-raiser, but that prohibited publication of details from the gathering. when the democratic fund-raising scandal broke last fall, gore said he thought the lunch had been a ""community outreach"" event. after the globe and other news organizations published the contents of memos from the vice president and his top aides that described the luncheon as a fund-raiser, gore acknowledged that he knew it was a ""finance-related"" event with traditional democratic donors invited.  but gore maintains that his staff did not tell him that the temple visit, which originally was scheduled as a non-political visit, had been transformed by mid-level party officials into a fund-raiser when plans for another southern california fund-raiser fell through. gore also says he did not know that temple members allegedly were pressured by those democratic officials to give tens of thousands of dollars in questionable contributions to the party after the luncheon and were then reimbursed by the taiwanese buddhist church.  the reporter accompanied gore on the marathon trip from washington to california on april 29, 1996, and interviewed the vice president on air force ii for a presidential campaign feature. the trip was packed with a variety of events, most prominently a midmorning speech to cable television executives in los angeles and a late-afternoon stroll with police on the beat in san jose. press secretary peggy wilhide and other members of gore's staff and security detail openly described two events on the day's schedule as ""fund-raisers"" closed to the press: the buddhist temple event in the los angeles suburb of hacienda heights and an evening reception in a private home in los altos hills, near san jose. upon request, gore's staff agreed to allow the globe into each occasion on an off-the-record basis.  after snarling traffic on the southern california freeways, gore's motorcade pulled up to the huge hsi lai complex shortly before 1 p.m. and was greeted by a high school marching band playing sousa tunes.  although the phrase ""buddhist temple"" might bring to mind a simple pagoda, the 15-acre hsi lai compound cost $ 30 million and includes a number of shrines and meditation halls, classrooms and conference rooms, a nunnery, a vip lodge, an auditorium, a museum, a large central courtyard, and two theme gardens with statues of arhats and bodhisattvas - buddhist holy beings.  the complex is the largest buddhist monastery in the western hemisphere. yun has built an international congregation of a million followers from his base in taiwan. gore first visited yun in taiwan in 1989 and then hosted the buddhist leader at the white house in march 1996.  gore's staff was warned to use ""great, great caution"" and to beware of a ""hidden"" taiwanese agenda in yun's dealings with gore, according to an april 19, 1996, memo from robert suettinger, a national security council official. yet the correspondence among the white house staff shows that gore's advisers and democratic finance officials repeatedly characterized the lunch as a prime fund-raising opportunity.  congressional investigators believe that two democratic party operatives, john huang and maria hsia, pushed to bring gore and the prosperous taiwanese buddhists together, arranged the luncheon, presided at the fund-raiser, and returned to the temple in the following days to press for contributions from nuns and monks who were later reimbursed by the church.  under state and federal law, non-profit institutions may not host partisan political events and retain their tax-favored status. individuals are prohibited from making political contributions in their own names only to be reimbursed by another individual or organization.  through statements issued by their attorneys, hsia and huang have denied any wrongdoing. in a statement to senate investigators released last month, yun accepted responsibility for the contributions from members of his temple but said his organization was only trying to honor gore and express its gratitude to the united states. he said the mistakes occurred because of a misunderstanding of us campaign laws. a prime question at the senate hearings will be what gore knew. gore says he knew the lunch guests were members of the democratic party's ""asian pacific american leadership council."" his briefing book that day noted membership in the group ""requires an annual contribution of $ 2,500 per person or $ 5,000 per couple."" his ""role"" at the luncheon was to ""extend appreciation for participant support and inspire political and fund-raising efforts among the asian pacific american community."" although representative robert matsui, a democrat from california, and don fowler, chairman of the democratic national committee, took turns thanking the audience for supporting the administration, gore chose not to use the partisan ""talking points"" from his speechwriters criticizing republican bob dole and house speaker newt gingrich. instead, gore and yun spoke of tolerance and religion. the vice president nibbled at his vegetarian meal, exchanged gifts with yun, posed for photographs with the 70 monks clad in saffron robes, and stood for a moment of reflection before a giant statue of sakyamuni buddha.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/18_eUfG4csMAq2l4heXuc36F-L2tz7JWk/view,Asian,1
"washington - former attorney general john ashcroft cannot be sued for his role in detaining an american muslim, even though the government did not charge the man with a crime or bring him as a witness in a terrorism investigation, the supreme court ruled yesterday.
justice antonin scalia said using the federal ``material witness'' statute to detain abdullah al-kidd as a material witness in a terrorism investigation does not give kidd a right to sue, because no court precedent had found such a use of the statute unlawful. ``qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions,'' scalia wrote. ``when properly applied it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. ashcroft deserves neither label.'' all eight justices hearing the case agreed that kidd's suit against ashcroft could not go forward; justice elena kagan sat out the case because she had worked on ashcroft's behalf as president obama's solicitor general. but there was disagreement about the government's action in the case and the treatment kidd received. kidd maintains that in his more than two weeks of detention, he was strip-searched, shackled, interrogated without an attorney present, and treated as a terrorist. justice ruth bader ginsburg, in a separate opinion joined by justices stephen breyer and sonia sotomayor, said kidd's ordeal ``is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity, constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times.''

"It's expected that virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019.Left: Powerbeats3 from Dr. Dre's Beats. Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

"upset that the big dig tunnel in which a ceiling collapsed had never been inspected, us representative michael e. capuano filed a bill in congress yesterday to mandate detailed inspections of all tunnels at least every two years.
capuano, a democrat from somerville who sits on the house transportation committee, said last night that he filed the bill in reaction to the july 10 ceiling collapse that took the life of milena del valle of jamaica plain. investigators quickly determined that the ceiling came down when a handful of bolts used to suspend it from the roof gave out. if inspectors had gone into the 5-foot-high crawl space above the suspended ceiling after the tunnel opened, they probably would have noticed bolts pulled out, perhaps alerting them to the danger of collapse, investigators have said. ""clearly, more must be done to ensure the safety of the traveling public,"" capuano said. ""apparently, if inspections are not required, they won't be done. this bill would require those inspections."" capuano's bill is modeled on the federal bridge program, which mandates inspections of bridges at least every two years. ""the bridge program means that when you drive over a bridge you know it's been inspected,"" he said. in the absence of a federal inspection program for tunnels, the massachusetts turnpike authority, which oversees the big dig, set its own inspection schedule. in the case of the interstate 90 connector tunnel where the collapse occurred, the turnpike had last inspected the ceiling in 2000, when it was built. the connector opened for traffic in 2003. but while state officials conducted a preopening safety check of the roadway surface and walls, no one got into the crawl space to view the hanger assembly that included the bolts. turnpike authority officials said after the collapse that they had been planning to inspect the connector later that summer, to fulfill legal obligations the authority assumed when selling billions of dollars in bonds to investors. turnpike officials interpreted their agreement with bondholders to mean that no inspection of the connector was required in 2003, its first year of use, when older sections of the big dig were inspected. after the ceiling collapse, investigators found 225 ceiling bolts in the connector that had pulled out of the roof at least a fraction of an inch, in addition to the 20 that had ripped out to cause the collapse. work crews have since abandoned the hanger assembly system that relied on epoxy to hold the bolts in holes drilled into the concrete roof. the new assembly system locks the bolts into place using grooves cut into the roof. also, officials have greatly increased the number of bolts carrying the weight of the concrete ceiling. capuano said he expected little opposition to the bill. he said the chairman of the transportation committee, james l. oberstar of minnesota, a democrat, had assured him of swift action.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dGbjkz4busAVw3W8AdQUAWjJETzlbeJC/view,N/A - not specified,0
"A fifth-grade instructor goes over an equation during math class at Dever Elementary School in Boston. Some kids moan when asked to do math homework; others chatter about what they learned in class that day. A student's feelings toward math ‚Äî and perhaps other subjects ‚Äî can impact his or her classroom achievement over time, according to a long-term study of middle-school students.
Regardless of a student's intelligence or economic background, those who took pride in and enjoyed math had better grades over time during the study, while performance spiraled downward for those experiencing anger, anxiety, or shame about the subject. ""Emotions are a powerful driver of students' learning,"" says study author Reinhard Pekrun, a professor of psychology at the University of Munich in Germany. The findings, published this month in the journal Child Development, should encourage parents, teachers, and administrators to bolster positive emotions and reduce negative emotions when it comes to math, says Pekrun. And that doesn't mean putting on a smile every time you talk about fractions. Clear, enthusiastic instruction ‚Äî during which a student is engaged rather than anxious or bored ‚Äî can promote a self-reinforcing path to academic success. The study relied on data from the Project for the Analysis of Learning and Achievement in Mathematics, or PALMA, which followed 3,425 German students from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds during grades 5 through 9. Researchers tracked students' grades and math test scores, and gave them a survey each year to probe their feelings about the subject. Other studies have examined the link between learning and children's emotions, but most focused on a single moment in time, such as one day or week of learning. The PALMA study, on the other hand, tracked learning and the effect of emotion over years. Overall, the results were as one might expect: Positive emotions were beneficial to learning while negative emotions were detrimental. Yet they do contradict the theory that if you enjoy something, you might not put as much effort into it. During five years of schooling, students with high intelligence had good grades and test scores, but those who also enjoyed and felt proud about their math work had even higher achievement. And students who experienced negative emotions ‚Äî anger, anxiety, shame, boredom, you name it ‚Äî were more likely to have lower achievement. The findings held true no matter a child's economic background, gender, or general intelligence, and the correlations got stronger as the years went on. ""Students who get positive feedback develop positive emotions, learn better, and their enjoyment further increases,"" says Pekrun. ""For those who are bored or anxious, performance deteriorates, they get negative feedback, become even more anxious or hopeless, and continue to spiral downward."" Educators can prevent negative feedback loops, and promote positive ones by being knowledgeable, and not anxious, about their subject or those emotions can pass onto the children, says Pekrun. He also suggests that teachers avoid competitive evaluations, which creates winners and losers, thereby sparking negative emotions in the latter. ""It drives too many students into states of panic, anxiety, hopelessness and, in the end, boredom,"" says Pekrun. ""And boredom is the prime cause for failed education.""

"racing to wrap up business before this year's session ends tomorrow, the house yesterday approved funding to create alternative sanctions programs for non-violent offenders, hire more state social workers and clear a backlog of cases involving special needs children awaiting adoption.  the alternative sanctions program, for which the house voted $ 11 million, would seek to rehabilitate offenders without incarceration - thus helping to relieve prison overcrowding. the vote would create alternative sanctions programs in suffolk, norfolk, hampden, briston and worcester counties.
""we can't build our way out of the problem and we can't punish our way out of the problem,"" said house speaker charles f. flaherty (d-cambridge), who championed the alternative sanctions idea.  rep. emanuel g. serra (d-east boston), who chaired a sentencing study committee appointed by flaherty, said it costs the state $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate, compared to about $ 6,000 a year for alternatives such as house arrest, electronic monitoring, community service or rehabilitation programs.  serra said statistics show that the recidivism rate is more than double among inmates who are released to the community directly from prison, compared to those who attend community corrections programs.  flaherty formed the study in response to a september globe spotlight team report which revealed that big-time drug dealers often bargain their way out of mandatory sentences by forfeiting drug profits, while first-time offenders are often given longer terms.  as part of a prison construction bond bill, the house is expected to vote today on another proposal from serra's committee that would give judges greater leeway to vary so-called mandatory sentences, providing they document why.  in a move to bolster the beleaguered department of social services, the house voted $ 4.9 million to hire additional social workers.  house ways and means chairman thomas m. finneran (d-mattapan) said the money will be earmarked for social workers to reduce caseloads.  gov. weld asked for $ 5.1 million in september to hire more than 100 new case workers, and an additional $ 8.8 million last month to help overburdened foster parents and provide more alternatives to traditional foster care.  yesterday the house voted to approve an additional $ 1 million to speed up the adoptions of special needs children who have languished in state care because of a lack of funding to process their cases.  another house vote would make it easier for the registry of motor vehicles to handle the unexpected costs of the ""sick building"" problems in its boston headquarters.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YOowlJ4aAlKxpOSHUVgig2aZob8UyLmh/view,Asian,1

"President Trump gave a campaign-style speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. WASHINGTON ‚Äî Attempting to put a defining framework on his tumultuous first month in office, President Trump on Friday articulated a new vision for the Republican Party as a populist defender of the working class that will challenge elites at home and abroad. Trump, speaking to hard-line GOP activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, made it clear how much the world has changed for rank-and-file Republicans since his insurgent campaign upended the party.
At times, he promoted positions that could have been ripped from the playbook of liberals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. ""The GOP will be from now on the party also of the American worker,"" Trump declared. ""First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents,"" he added. ""The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first."" In a wide-ranging, campaign-style speech, Trump bashed the media, and reiterated his promises for a massive buildup of the American military, the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, and the renegotiation of trade deals. He pointed to his administration's efforts to cut back regulations as a key way to promote job growth and protect workers. After his speech, Trump signed a new executive order requiring agencies to form regulatory reform task forces to assess additional ways to eliminate regulations. The enthusiastic response to Trump's speech marked a complete turnaround for the nation's premier gathering of conservatives, which had once greeted him with skepticism. At his first appearance at the conference in 2011, Trump walked out to the song ""Money"" and drew laughs and boos from the crowd. Last year, Trump declined an invitation to speak at the event.On Friday, he explainedthat absence by sayinghe worried his ideas would be ""too controversial."" But Friday's remarks represented Trump's attempt to recast the Republican Party ‚Äî and the conservatives who represent its base ‚Äî in his own image. At one point, he said, ""Now you finally have a president, finally,"" and at another point, he said the Middle East is in ""much worse shape than it was 15 years ago"" ‚Äî a timeframe that extends back to the presidency of Republican George W. Bush. The crowd reveled in chants of ""lock her up,"" echoing last year's campaign chants targeting Hillary Clinton, and ""USA! USA!"" underscoring Trump's appeals to nationalism. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's joke earlier in the week that CPAC should be renamed ""TPAC"" in honor of the president seemed more fitting. Trump's appearance Friday was the first by a sitting president since Bush spoke in 2003 and the first by a president in his inaugural year in office since Ronald Reagan in 1981. In all, Reagan spoke at CPAC 13 times. Trump said he plans to make annual visits to the conference. Vice President Mike Pence compared Trump to Reagan in his speech Thursday night. ""I believe President Trump has given voice to aspirations and frustrations to Americans like no leader since Reagan,"" he said. In his own speech, Trump assailed the Affordable Care Act, blamed President Obama for leaving him with ""a mess,"" and promised to halt illegal immigration. But as he gears up to deliver a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, lawmakers are going to be looking for more specifics, including how to fund his proposals. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are still trying to figure out exactly how to replace the federal health care law. They're also dealing with the lingering backlash to Trump's executive order on immigration, which sought to bar immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations before it was halted by the courts. Across the aisle, Democrats have been energized by the Trump administration, vowing to stall and prevent the president's agenda at every chance they get. Trump did not once mention his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in his speech, a surprising omission given the choice was widely heralded by conservatives. He did, however, deliver a blistering critique of the media, attacking ""fake news"" and journalists' use of anonymous sources. ""It doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it,"" Trump said about the media.""Many of these groups are part of large media corporations that have their own agenda."" His attack on the media's use of anonymous sources came less than an hourafter White House officials held a background briefing ‚Äîdemanding anonymity ‚Äî with journalists to dispute a CNN story. CNN had reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked the FBI to push back against media reports about communications between Trump aides and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. The vision Trump outlined Friday was a less extreme version of the worldview expressed by Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, who spoke Thursday about the ""deconstruction of the administrative state."" Bannon, making a rare public appearance, took the stage with Priebus and the two played down any conflict between them. But, a day before Trump's speech, attendees at CPAC on Thursday were still coming to grips with his new party and wrestling with questions of whether he is a true conservative. ""He has evolved and he understands the importance of the values of the conservative moment,"" said Kirk Lippold, who was the commanding officer of the USS Cole when it was bombed in Yemen in 2000. ""I think that while Donald Trump was elected because they believe he is a conservative, they are watching him do things that now support that,"" he said. Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, the group that hosts CPAC, agreed, pointing to Trump's first month in office as evidence of his conservative principles.

"boston university president john silber, a potential candidate for governor in 1994, is striving to explain comments he made at a new york university forum two weeks ago, where he reportedly said he was sick of ""so-called gay people trying to force their sexual lifestyles down everybody's throats."" the forum, titled ""anatomy of hate"" and sponsored by the elie wiesel foundation for humanity, was a two-day conference that began nov. 15 at nyu. silber was on a panel discussing how children learn hatred, when a gay activist stood up and protested the lack of an openly gay person on the panel who could address hate crimes against gay people and homophobia. silber responded to the activist, new york lawyer william dobbs, by suggesting that a discussion of gay issues was inappropriate. although no record of the exchange is readily available, gabriel rotello, a free-lance reporter for new york newsday, asked silber what he had said in a telephone interview nov. 25 that rotello said he recorded.
according to rotello, who published an article on the subject in wednesday's new york newsday, silber recalled that he responded to dobbs by saying that ""most of us consider sexuality a private concern,"" and that he was sick of ""so-called gay people trying to force their sexual lifestyles down everybody's throats, insisting on turning every meeting into a testimonial on sexual preference."" silber said in the interview with rotello that homosexuality ""had no place in a discussion concerning children, for whom homosexual orientation is not an issue . . . decent parents don't even discuss the possibility that there are homosexuals."" the controversial bu president, who was well known for making statements dubbed ""silber shockers"" in his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 1990, added that there was no place for gays in a multicultural curriculum, because ""gayness is not a culture."" ""if you make it a culture you've got to have a culture of hamburger eaters and pastrami eaters, too,"" silber said, according to rotello's transcipt of the conversation. silber declined to talk to the globe. but in a letter that silber wrote to wiesel, a bu professor, silber does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes attributed to him by rotello. instead, he disputes rotello's description of how dobbs interrupted the forum and how silber allegedly ""exploded"" in response. ""dobbs burst into the discussion with a tirade denouncing the conference because of the absence of any gay person on the panel,"" silber wrote to wiesel. ""and my response, far from an explosion, was a calm examination of the issues."" ""i pointed out that dobbs could not possibly know how many 'straight' or 'gay' people were among the panelists because only he had declared himself with regard to his sexual preference. i pointed out that he did not know mine and i did not know the sexual preference of the other people in the room,"" silber wrote. ""i made it clear that i refused to be intimidated by his dobbs' hatred for people who do not endorse his lifestyle,"" silber wrote in the letter, dated dec. 3, which was provided by bu. dobbs could not be reached for comment yesterday. in the letter, silber goes on to defend his record on gay issues in his 22 years at boston university, saying he has ""consistently upheld their legal and constitutional rights"" and employed many ""homosexuals at all levels."" ""the point at which homosexuals and i part company is when they try to make public proclamation of our sexual orientation and demand that everyone endorse their lifestyle as normative,"" silber wrote. ""no one is under any obligation to endorse the homosexual lifestyle although all of us have an obligation to respect the rights of individuals who are homosexual,"" he wrote.

"It's expected that virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019.Left: Powerbeats3 from Dr. Dre's Beats. Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

"racing to wrap up business before this year's session ends tomorrow, the house yesterday approved funding to create alternative sanctions programs for non-violent offenders, hire more state social workers and clear a backlog of cases involving special needs children awaiting adoption.  the alternative sanctions program, for which the house voted $ 11 million, would seek to rehabilitate offenders without incarceration - thus helping to relieve prison overcrowding. the vote would create alternative sanctions programs in suffolk, norfolk, hampden, briston and worcester counties.
""we can't build our way out of the problem and we can't punish our way out of the problem,"" said house speaker charles f. flaherty (d-cambridge), who championed the alternative sanctions idea.  rep. emanuel g. serra (d-east boston), who chaired a sentencing study committee appointed by flaherty, said it costs the state $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate, compared to about $ 6,000 a year for alternatives such as house arrest, electronic monitoring, community service or rehabilitation programs.  serra said statistics show that the recidivism rate is more than double among inmates who are released to the community directly from prison, compared to those who attend community corrections programs.  flaherty formed the study in response to a september globe spotlight team report which revealed that big-time drug dealers often bargain their way out of mandatory sentences by forfeiting drug profits, while first-time offenders are often given longer terms.  as part of a prison construction bond bill, the house is expected to vote today on another proposal from serra's committee that would give judges greater leeway to vary so-called mandatory sentences, providing they document why.  in a move to bolster the beleaguered department of social services, the house voted $ 4.9 million to hire additional social workers.  house ways and means chairman thomas m. finneran (d-mattapan) said the money will be earmarked for social workers to reduce caseloads.  gov. weld asked for $ 5.1 million in september to hire more than 100 new case workers, and an additional $ 8.8 million last month to help overburdened foster parents and provide more alternatives to traditional foster care.  yesterday the house voted to approve an additional $ 1 million to speed up the adoptions of special needs children who have languished in state care because of a lack of funding to process their cases.  another house vote would make it easier for the registry of motor vehicles to handle the unexpected costs of the ""sick building"" problems in its boston headquarters.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YOowlJ4aAlKxpOSHUVgig2aZob8UyLmh&usp=drive_copy,N/A - not specified,0
"a simple silver cross over the front door sets apart the red-brick building at the top of harbor street from others in the point, an immigrant neighborhood on the edge of downtown salem. st. joseph convent the last in a city that once had five has been home to catholic nuns since the first convent was built 112 years ago to serve st. joseph school and church. over time, three orders of nuns lived at the convent, teaching next door at the school. ¬†¬†¬†¬†the convent today is home to four sisters of the assumption of the blessed virgin, which has staffed st. joseph school since 1925. three of them sister fernande richard, sister yvette beauregard, and sister estelle grenier are true daughters of st. joseph. they grew up in the parish and went to the school there. a fourth, sister muriel lemoine, lives at the convent, but works as the campus minister at salem state college.
""it always seemed so special here,"" beauregard, 59, said softly, seated on a chair in the living room. ""when i was a young girl, i saw that the nuns were dedicated to their faith. they were happy. they were living together."" convent life at st. joseph may soon end. the three-story convent is expected to close, along with st. joseph church, some time over the next six months. the 131-year-old, french-canadian parish is among 65 scheduled to close as part of a massive reconfiguration of the archdiocese of boston. st. joseph school won't close, howev er. that will move across town to the old st. james school on federal street. the rev. lawrence rondeau, pastor of st. joseph, has appealed to archbishop sean p. o'malley to keep st. joseph open. in addition to the school, rondeau has cited the parish's thriving hispanic ministry, and a food pantry that serves 3,000 people each month in salem. if the parish closes, the sisters will lose their home. and salem has no other convent for them. other parishes closed or sold their convents amid a wave of catholic school closings in the 1970s. unlike parish priests, nuns do not work for the archdiocese. they work for their religious orders. ""we are not a diocesan community,"" said beauregard, the school's third-grade teacher. ""we belong to our congregation. . . . each parish with a school usually has a convent, but at st. james, there isn't one."" and if the convent closes, where will the sisters live? ""we don't know,"" said richard, 70, the school librarian. ""that's the honest truth."" since the parish closing was announced may 25, the sisters have spent much of their time consoling parishioners and reassuring parents that st. joseph school will stay open. they say they haven't had time to think about their own future. ""people here are upset,"" said richard, who grew up just blocks from the convent. ""we can't add to their burden. . . . i guess when the decision is final, we'll go see what's out there."" ""i know god will always take care of us,"" said grenier, 69, a special education teacher at the school. ""in the past, he always has . . . i cannot say i have lost my peace about this."" but st. joseph parents worry for the nuns' future. at a meeting last week to discuss the school move, a parent asked, ""what about our sisters?"" the sisters were asked to stand. they received a prolonged ovation from more than 100 parents and teachers that packed the school hall. monsignor paul v. garrity, the vicar for salem who ran the school meeting, didn't have an answer. ""it's one of those questions that really has to be looked at,"" he said. in an interview, garrity said the nuns probably will have to find their own housing. nuns involved in social work, health care, and other non-parish ministries often rent their own apartments. ""sisters today do receive a stipend,"" he said, adding he is sympathetic to the nuns. ""many of them come together to determine how they'll live."" the st. joseph nuns would like to stay together. ""this has been a wonderful community to be part of,"" said grenier, who moved to the convent 19 years ago. ""very good women live here."" but it may not be possible for them to stay together. a four-bedroom apartment or house is scarce. they also are expensive, particularly around st. james, which stands in the heart of the mcintire historic district, a neighborhood of stately federalist and georgian homes. ideally, they would like to be close to the school. the sisters, all of whom took a vow of poverty, pool their salaries. although they live rent-free at the convent, they pay for utilities, food, and other household necessities. each lives on a small budget to cover personal expenses, such as clothes and medications. when the school moves to st. james, the parish and school will pay their stipend. their order, too, will give them a stipend. but the sisters are still bracing for higher housing costs. ""it's going to be different,"" said richard, who takes care of convent finances. ""our order will help us some, but how much we're not sure."" although the sisters have quietly started asking around about apartments, they're prepared for the possibility that they may not be able to live together. ""the chances are not all of us will be together,"" said richard, who has lived at st. joseph for 33 years. ""we need space. we're used to having a whole house. . . . apartment living is going to be a big adjustment for us."" still, despite their own needs, the nuns remain focused on parish life. st. joseph serves salem's poorest neighborhood. more than half of its 900 families are hispanic, most of them immigrants from the dominican republic. the church has the only spanish mass in salem. it runs the largest food pantry. despite the many demands, the parish has no debt, parish officials said. the nuns thought st. joseph would survive the parish closings. they were heartened when o'malley said he would give special preference to parishes with schools, and serving new immigrants. ""when i heard that, i thought, 'we're out of the woods,' "" said beauregard. ""that's why this has all been so shocking."" they can't help but question the decision. ""i don't know what his [o'malley's] definition of poor is, if it is not here,"" richard said. ""i think these closings have not had any compassion for people,"" grenier said. ""from the start it has always been about buildings and property. that's where there has been no compassion."" beauregard has a special attachment to the convent. her uncle and father help build it in 1962, when the original convent had to be torn down. the new convent, with a private chapel and communal living space, had private bedrooms for 30 nuns. ""they built this house,"" she said proudly. and their quiet presence in the hardscrabble neighborhood has been a blessing. grenier discovered that on mother's day. as she was returning to the convent in the afternoon, a hispanic man in his 30s ran up to her. she recognized him as the man she waves to every day at the start of her 6 a.m. walk around salem. he gave her a big hug. ""he said to me 'happy mother's day, mom,' "" grenier said, a big smile on her face. ""i was so moved. nobody has ever said that to me. and he is just someone i wave to every day. i said to him, 'oh, my god. thank you. thank you.'

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia ‚Äî For years, North Korea has rattled the world with its nuclear tests and its threats to visit a nuclear holocaust upon the United States. Now, the finding by Malaysian police that Kim Jong Nam was assassinated with VX nerve agent is a stark reminder of the North's lesser-known weapons of mass destruction: a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. Kim, the estranged elder brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was killed Feb. 13 when two women rubbed his face with the nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the police said Friday.
If North Korean nationals were indeed behind the killing, as Malaysian officials suggest, the use of VX raises several questions: Was the North Korean government using the attack to signal to the world its fearsome arsenal of such dangerous weapons? Or was the toxin simply an attempt to avoid detection in carrying out a brazen killing at one of the world's busiest airports? ""By using VX in an international airport in the heart of Asia, North Korea has sent a very clear message to the world that it will strike its enemies anywhere in the world,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on terrorism at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""It also demonstrates the North Korean response in the event of an attack against North Korea,"" Gunaratna said. North Korea's nuclear program has long been the most urgent concern of the United States and its allies, and the now-dormant six-party talks to curb the program did not address chemical and biological weapons. ""The reported use of VX reminds us that not only is the North's nuclear-missile threat serious but so are its asymmetric threats, including biochemical weapons and cyber that are all part of the regime's WMD tool kit,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. South Korea's Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed ""shock"" at the use of a chemical weapon and vowed to work with the international society to deal ""strongly"" with the violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The deadly use of a chemical weapon banned by international conventions could strengthen calls for the United States to put North Korea back on a list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, analysts said. The North was first put on the terrorist list after its bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in 1987, killing all 115 people onboard. But the United States delisted the country in 2008 as part of an agreement aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programs ‚Äî a deal that has since disintegrated. After his announcement that Kim had been killed by VX nerve agent, Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police, said Friday that small amounts of the poison could have been brought into the country without being discovered. Two women have been arrested in the killing, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam. The attackers could have used a safety-enhancing battlefield form of the agent. Known as VX2, it is divided into two compounds that are harmless individually but become lethal when mixed together. If Kim's two assassins had each applied one component of VX, this would explain why two assassins were needed, how they survived the attack, and perhaps why it took 15 minutes or more for Kim to die. ""Use of a binary nerve agent lends itself to this method and allows for a potentially highly targeted hit,"" said Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has two degrees in chemical engineering. Narang said it was clear that North Korea wanted the West to know what it is capable of ‚Äî but without causing mass casualties. ""They wanted everyone, especially the US, to know it was VX and that they can make it or have it,"" he said.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u83cJPHMArk_vpec1GlqPiHS03NtbGXS/view,Asian,1

teams have formed cable stations. you've got the red sox and nesn, the lakers and prime time, and a few other examples. but this is the first time a professional sports team has purchased a ""free"" tv station for the purpose of producing its own telecasts. obviously, messrs. gaston, alan cohen and paul dupee think this is an eminently logical business proposition. it's all heady stuff if, like me, your biggest exposure to the business world was a kool-aid stand in front of your house when you were 10. people keep telling us that the worlds of athletics and entertainment are becoming indistinguishable. who can doubt it now? the players may not know it, but the boys up top already have those aftra applications in the mail. the time is past when celtics players, coaches and management personnel can justify their salaries solely by playing basketball. imagine the look of channel 25 programming a year from now: 7:30 casting with kevin who needs gaddabout gaddis? fishing (and hunting) enthusiasts can tune in for the next 10,000 weeks as kevin mchale takes viewers on a tour of each and every one of his home state's lakes. see lucky contestants vie for prizes by taking jump hooks at special floating backboards. 8:00 mr. rodgers' neighborhood the pilot's a pip. mr. rodgers is a new head coach. a couple of games into his inaugural season, his best player goes down for the year. after the draft, he goes off on a peaceful vacation in the woods with his brother and friends to unwind. no phone. no beeper. totally incommunicado. he comes home after a week to find out that his prize rookie point guard has accepted a million-dollar offer to play in italy. yeah, it is unbelievable, but they figure if you'll buy a 16-year old doctor, you'll buy anything. 8:30 jurisprudence with jan each week, celtics general manager jan volk is presented with a hypothetical sports law case that he must clarify for the masses by using the greatest number of polysyllabic words and compound-complex sentences. 9:00 hello, larry the once-shy hoosier has blossomed sufficiently to host his own talk show. guests on the first program will include moses malone (get ready for the banter on the '81 playoffs) and bill laimbeer. larry bounces one-liners off a guffawing rick robey, who loves to reminisce about his favorite sneakaway dunks and steak dinners. a special feature will be the alumni corner, one of the highlights being garfield smith's animated discussion of his famed 1970 air ball hat trick from the free throw line in phoenix. 10:00 arnie's angst he used to coach the team, and he remembers when it was a simpler world. he also was the general manager, the traveling secretary, team psychiatrist and accountant. he didn't know from assistants, and all he did was win every year. now they've got about 18 people to do what he once did. he goes to the league meetings and all they talk about are luxury boxes, balance sheets and audience shares. he's disoriented.

"The J.C. Penney Co. on Friday said it plans to close between 130 and 140 stores in the next several months, a move that makes it the latest retail stalwart to pull back from the mall amid the rise of online shopping.
The department store giant's latest quarterly results, also released Friday, illustrate its struggle to connect with shoppers: Sales were down 0.7 percent at stores open more than a year. And yet the report also demonstrated that the chain, unlike department store rivals such as Macy's and Sears, has had improving momentum lately. The company managed to deliver a net profit in 2016, the first time it has done so since 2010. J.C. Penney's decision to close stores comes as many industry executives and analysts say that old-school chains are ""overstored,"" meaning they have too many locations for the era of online shopping. Macy's is in the process of closing 100 stores and eliminating some 10,000 jobs. Sears said in January it would close 150 stores, some from its namesake chain, and some from the Kmart chain. Marvin Ellison, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that J.C. Penney is slashing stores because ""we believe we must take aggressive action to better align our retail operations for sustainable growth."" The company is set to disclose in mid-March which locations it is to shut down. J.C. Penney said the affected stores account for less than 5 percent of total sales. It expects the closures will result in $200 million of annual cost savings. It is not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected by the closures.

"bso kurt masur, conductor at: symphony hall, last night (repeats today, tomorrow, and tuesday) so what are your plans for mendelssohn's 200th birthday? the big day is not until feb. 3, but the boston symphony orchestra is already celebrating with an all-mendelssohn program this week in symphony hall. next season the bso will perform the composer's remarkable oratorio ""elijah,"" but for now it's a bread-and-butter program of the third and fourth symphonies along with the ""hebrides overture.""
on the podium this week is the german maestro kurt masur, who is not a bad guy to have around for a mendelssohn birthday party. at 81, he has lived with this music for well over half a century; he has recorded large quantities of it; and he was music director of the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra for more than two decades, a post that the composer held. this year masur is traveling around the world championing mendelssohn, who, while hardly neglected, still sometimes has to argue his way into the very top ranks of 19th-century composers. last night, in warm and spacious performances, masur and the orchestra showed just how silly that argument is. the masterfully drawn, richly atmospheric ""hebrides overture,"" written after a visit in 1829 to the hebrides islands off the coast of scotland, came across with just the right blend of clarity and mystery. the strings had a burnished yet mellow tone, anchored by the cellos. all those rippling figurations in the violins came across, as they should, like wind over water. the ""scottish"" symphony no. 3 owes its inspiration to the same summer travels, yet the work was completed in 1842. last night there was a natural, just-so quality to the unfurling of the lines and the pacing more generally. in the first movement, masur drew a striking pianissimo sound from the orchestra, quiet yet well-supported. the scherzo was duly light and diaphanous, and the adagio cantabile had the gentle singing quality requested by its name. in the fourth movement, masur coaxed some emphatic playing from the orchestra, lending the textures an almost beethovenian heft without sounding forced or false. masur, of course, knows the orchestra well from his guest visits over the years, but last night there was a more elusive quality in that mysterious way an ensemble can sometimes channel a conductor's musical personality for an evening. in that spirit, this was mendelssohn with commitment and integrity. jeremy eichler can be reached at jeichler@globe.com",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBDh1EYPdBr1nQdizsumV7aiG87MFppB/view,N/A - not specified,0

was off balance. Then I just put it up.&quot; While Oni was getting up, Aiken waved at the Crimson
fan section that had come alive as Harvard was putting Yale to sleep. Aiken&#39;s three came in
the middle of a 32-12 second-half storm by the Crimson that helped them put the Bulldogs
away, 77-64, on Friday night at Lavietes Pavillion. The Crimson (17-7, 9-2 Ivy) swept their
series with the Bulldogs (14-10, 6-5) after being swept by Yale a year ago. &quot;I thought it was
a highly competitive game between two teams that are certainly playing for a lot of different
reasons,&quot; said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. &quot;They&#39;re such a tough team to defend,
especially on the backboard. We knew that and how hard they were going to be on the
offensive glass.&quot; Aiken, who torched Yale for 27 points two weeks ago in New Haven, put up
22 more on Friday, knocking down 7 of 14 shots and going 5 of 8 from three. &quot;As we&#39;ve
seen, he can create a lot,&quot; Amaker said. &quot;He&#39;s very crafty and dynamic with the ball and his
shot-making ability changes because of his size. He&#39;s a hard guard in terms of how do you
rush out on him, [he has] ball skills and craftiness to go by you and make a play. He can be a
dynamic offensive player and certainly we&#39;ve seen that throughout the season.&quot; Coming into
the game, Yale had the second-best scoring offense in the Ivy League and led the conference
in rebounding and offensive rebounding, so the points of emphasis were obvious for the
Crimson. That didn&#39;t stop the Bulldogs from grabbing 24 rebounds (seven offensive) in the
first half. &quot;It wasn&#39;t good,&quot; Amaker said. &quot;I thought we did obviously a pretty darn good job
defensive rebounding for the most part, but we gave up 12 offensive rebounds [total]. I was
disappointed in that. That&#39;s what I thought was the difference in the first half for their team,
getting the extra opportunities. They didn&#39;t cash in as many, thank goodness, because I
think that would&#39;ve been the difference in the game.&quot; Between senior big man Zena
Edosomwan (four rebounds, two blocks) and freshmen forwards Chris Lewis (six rebounds)
and Seth Towns (eight rebounds), the Crimson tightened up on the glass in the second half,
neutralizing Yale&#39;s biggest strength. In the meantime, Harvard&#39;s front line did the bulk of the
damage on offense. Towns gave the Crimson 18 points, and Edosomwan added 15 points.
&quot;We take pride in that,&quot; Towns said. &quot;We didn&#39;t do it in the first half. In the second half, we
did.&quot; Even though they&#39;ve already secured a spot in the Ivy League&#39;s first postseason
tournament, the Crimson are still hunting for the regular-season title. They sit two games
behind first-place Princeton, which pummeled Columbia on the road, 64-45. Amaker took
extra time after the game to talk to his team about the importance of the Crimson&#39;s final
home game of the season. &quot;We just talked right away about trying to close out the weekend
the right way,&quot; Amaker said. &quot;And I wanted them to understand what that means, the spirit

of senior day and you can&#39;t just expect or assume things are going to go our way because
this is the way it&#39;s supposed to go. We have to prepare the right way and I just mentioned to
our guys, let&#39;s start that right now.&quot; Julian Benbow can be reached at jbenbow@globe.com

"a health worker took a sample from a woman in her car at a testing station to test for covid-19 in nelson bay, australia, as authorities struggled on monday to contain several clusters of the coronavirus, mostly in urban areas, around the country. early results from a british vaccine study suggest that mixing different brands of vaccines can provoke a protective immune response against covid-19. in the trial, volunteers produced high levels of antibodies and immune cells after getting one dose of the pfizer-biontech vaccine and one dose of the astrazeneca-oxford shot.
administering the vaccines in either order is likely to provide potent protection, matthew snape, a vaccine specialist at the university of oxford, said at a news conference monday. snape and his colleagues began the trial, called com-cov, in february. in the first wave of the study, they gave 830 volunteers one of four combinations of vaccines. some got two doses of either pfizer or astrazeneca, both of which have been shown to be effective against covid. others got a dose of one vaccine, followed by a dose of the other. for the first wave of volunteers, the researchers waited four weeks between doses. studies have found the astrazeneca vaccine provides stronger protection if the second dose is delayed up to 12 weeks, so the researchers are also running a separate 12-week trial which should deliver results next month. the researchers found that volunteers reported more chills, headaches, and muscle pain than people who get two doses of the same vaccine. snape and his colleagues then drew blood to measure the immune response in the volunteers. they found that those who got two doses of pfizer-biontech produced levels of antibodies about 10 times as high as those who got two doses of astrazeneca. volunteers who got pfizer followed by astrazeneca showed antibody levels about five times as high as those with two doses of astrazeneca. and volunteers who got astrazeneca followed by pfizer reached antibody levels about as high as those who got doses of pfizer. he said the differences would most likely narrow in the volunteers who get a second dose after 12 weeks, when the astrazeneca vaccine has had more time to strengthen its effects. the study also found that using different vaccines produced a higher level of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus than did giving two doses of the same vaccine. snape said it wasn't clear yet why mixing had that advantage. new york times 3rd astrazeneca dose boosts immune response a third dose of the vaccine developed by astrazeneca and the university of oxford generated a strong immune response in clinical trial volunteers, oxford researchers said monday. the finding indicates that the astrazeneca vaccine could be an option should third shots end up being needed, for example, to extend immunity. to date, the vaccine has been given as two doses, typically between 4 and 12 weeks apart. the new data, detailed in a preprint manuscript, came from 90 study volunteers in britain who were among the earliest to receive the shots in a clinical trial last year. in march, they were given a third dose, roughly 30 weeks after their second. laboratory analyses showed that the third dose increased levels of antibodies to the virus in the volunteers to a point higher than seen a month after their second dose ‚Äî an encouraging sign that the third shot would be likely to bring greater protection if the effectiveness of two doses waned over time. new york times worried about delta, who urges vaccinated to mask world health organization officials, concerned about the easing of precautions meant to stop the spread of the coronavirus even as the most contagious variant to date has emerged, have urged even fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and to keep taking other measures to prevent infection. the centers for disease control and prevention, on the other hand, told fully vaccinated americans in may that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or to maintain a distance of 6 feet from other people. the agency also eased advice about testing and quarantine after suspected exposure to the virus. asked on monday about the new cautions expressed by the who ‚Äî the world's largest public health organization ‚Äî a cdc spokesperson pointed to the existing guidance and gave no indication it would change. dr. mari√¢ngela sim√£o, the who's assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals, said that even vaccinated people should continue to consistently wear masks, avoid crowds, and maintain social distance from others, make sure they are in well-ventilated spaces, wash their hands frequently, and avoid sneezing or coughing around other people. ""what we're saying is, 'once you've been fully vaccinated, continue to play it safe, because you could end up as part of a transmission chain.""' said dr. bruce aylward, a senior adviser to the who. new york times australia faces 'critical time' with new covid-19 clusters sydney ‚Äî australia is on the verge of a national coronavirus outbreak just as most other developed economies are emerging from restrictions, with the delta virus variant seeding new clusters across the continent. the highly transmissible variant, first detected in india, is confounding authorities' ability to stay ahead of its spread, even with rigorous contact-tracing and domestic border closures that have allowed the country to remain largely open for most of the pandemic. officials said it is a ""critical time"" for the nation. ""we're entering a new phase of this pandemic, with the more contagious delta strain,"" josh frydenberg, the country's top finance official, said on the australian broadcasting corp. by monday, the country's most populous city, sydney, and its smallest capital, darwin, in the northern territory, were in lockdown. mask mandates were introduced in the federal capital, canberra; in queensland; and in perth, capital of western australia state. victoria, home to melbourne, imposed border restrictions on several of the states. washington post europe toughens curbs on uk visitors to stem variant portugal and spain imposed new restrictions on british visitors monday amid concern about the delta variant as germany pushed for a more coordinated european union response to try to limit the virus taking hold in the bloc. the changes are a setback for europe's holiday destinations just as the summer tourism season should be kicking up a gear. the latest decisions add to the patchwork of confusing, and rapidly changing, rules in place for holiday makers. german chancellor angela merkel has suggested the entire eu should coordinate closely and be more cautious about allowing entry to travelers from external countries. the country already has a ban on most travel from the uk. portugal's latest decision, which takes effect monday, imposes a quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals from britain. other countries, including spain, malta, and hong kong, have also recently announced new rules on arrivals from the uk. bloomberg news",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vAjjQpxO_L6eA0vBw8M3CV93v1mhjNLs&usp=drive_copy,White,1

"The J.C. Penney Co. on Friday said it plans to close between 130 and 140 stores in the next several months, a move that makes it the latest retail stalwart to pull back from the mall amid the rise of online shopping.
The department store giant's latest quarterly results, also released Friday, illustrate its struggle to connect with shoppers: Sales were down 0.7 percent at stores open more than a year. And yet the report also demonstrated that the chain, unlike department store rivals such as Macy's and Sears, has had improving momentum lately. The company managed to deliver a net profit in 2016, the first time it has done so since 2010. J.C. Penney's decision to close stores comes as many industry executives and analysts say that old-school chains are ""overstored,"" meaning they have too many locations for the era of online shopping. Macy's is in the process of closing 100 stores and eliminating some 10,000 jobs. Sears said in January it would close 150 stores, some from its namesake chain, and some from the Kmart chain. Marvin Ellison, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that J.C. Penney is slashing stores because ""we believe we must take aggressive action to better align our retail operations for sustainable growth."" The company is set to disclose in mid-March which locations it is to shut down. J.C. Penney said the affected stores account for less than 5 percent of total sales. It expects the closures will result in $200 million of annual cost savings. It is not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected by the closures. The company says it will offer a voluntary early retirement package to 6,000 employees. WasHington Post",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUzHGlGQwzClleH2QNXQl1fh9a0NeWMc/view,N/A - not specified,0

renamed &quot;Phil&quot; by the Animal Rescue League. The shelter said it received thousands of

"Harvard's Bryce Aiken (22 points) finds some room to operate in the first half. Lying stomach down on the hardwood, staring up as Harvard freshman guard Bryce Aiken got his feet together at the 3-point line, Yale freshman guard Miye Oni couldn't have been in a more helpless position. All he could do was look up at Aiken, who glanced down at him, knowing exactly what was coming next.
As soon as Oni fell, losing his footing when Aiken quickly stopped at the 3-point line, Aiken had no choice but to pull the trigger. It's essentially an unwritten rule in basketball: If your defender falls, you have to put a shot up. ""Of course,"" Aiken said. Aiken waited a second, sized up the shot, then fired a 3-pointer that splashed through the nets. ""I guess I got him on the move,"" Aiken said.

"It's expected that virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019.Left: Powerbeats3 from Dr. Dre's Beats. Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones ‚Äî starting with the most recent model 7 ‚Äî would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.
 Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA ‚Äî high-resolution audio ‚Äî is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff ‚Äî and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening ‚Äî¬†or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi ‚Äî the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world ‚Äî¬†has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you ‚Äî¬†including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space ‚Äî¬†augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

"Amanda Abbott (left) and Leonie Little-Lex are among a group of local artists who sold more than $4,000 of watercolors, ceramics, prints, and jewelry to benefit Greater Boston Legal Services and the Refugee & Immigrant Assistance Center. A protest earlier this month on City Hall Plaza (above) was just one of many that have taken place in Boston and across the country. The Davis Museum (left) removed works of art by immigrants in support of protests against President Trump's immigration policies.
Protesters are busy these days. The election has given so many so much to oppose that Stacey Dogan, a Boston University law professor who cofounded a local resistance group, likened keeping up with it all to a ""second job."" ""Every day you could be going to something different,"" she said. In Boston, a hub of political protest since the election, progressives are packing house parties to brainstorm. They are signing up with sites like SwingLeft.org or Flippable.org to learn about and, they hope, to sway political races in nearby or distant states. They're raising money for groups they see as threatened by President Trump's agenda, and are going to training sessions to learn how to organize. They're getting ""daily action alerts"" on their phones. In Dorchester, a group of newly minted activists eager to help their Vietnamese and Cape Verdean neighbors located volunteers to translate the ACLU's instructions on what to do if immigration agents show up at their door. ""The directions were only in English and Spanish,"" said Erin Carey, a veterinarian who organized a ""huddle"" in Dorchester. Her group is one of 222 huddles statewide, and one of nearly 5,000 across the country that formed in the wake of the Women's March, according to Yordanos Eyoel, a spokeswoman for the Sister March Network. The huddles can be as small as eight people, she said, or as large as one in Orlando, which has more than 350 members. On Commonwealth Avenue, two artists who've been friends since middle school organized 50 fellow artists for a group sale at an all-female tattoo parlor. ""We got this together in two weeks,"" said Amanda Abbott, a tattoo artist at Brilliance Tattoo. ""People are so riled up they want to do something."" The artists sold more than $4,000 of watercolors, ceramics, prints, and jewelry to benefit Greater Boston Legal Services and the Refugee & Immigrant Assistance Center. Abbott wants to hold similar events throughout Trump's presidency. A Brookline huddle is planning to use the Boston Marathon to publicize an anti-Trump message. They're selling T-shirts, hoodies, and hats that read #PERSIST and PERSISTER. Profits will go to The Sister March Network as well as a Marathon charity, said group member Sarah Pagliaccio. The goal is to create a ""wall"" of resistance from Hopkinton to Boston. Although it's been nearly half a century since the country has seen such widespread activism, Ellen Fitzpatrick, a history professor at the University of New Hampshire, says that radical movements are an ""American tradition."" ""Whether it was the suffragists marches in the early 20th century or the huge antiwar marches of the '60s and early '70s, we've seen this before,"" she said. ""Look at the populist movement in the late 19th century, when American farmers started a grassroots movement attempting to challenge the power of big corporate interests and banks,"" she said. ""There were marches of unemployed people who came to Washington during the Depression in the 1890s to protest their situation, and the civil rights movement."" But, Fitzpatrick said, there is a difference this time: The administration's alleged connections to a foreign power that for much of the Cold War was considered an enemy. ""We're in entirely new territory."" Indeed, Tiziana C. Dearing, a Boston College professor and co-director of the school's Center for Social Innovation, says many people have been spurred to action because they feel that Trump poses an ""existential threat."" ""There aren't a lot of formal levers to counter that threat,"" Dearing said. ""And if you don't have formal levers, people take to the streets."" And many of those people include children, as parents fit protest actions into the family schedule, working in resistance in between cello lessons, sports, and homework. Protesting has become such a part of Cambridge writer Katherine Wolff's family routine that when one of her 12-year-old twins heard mom sigh after reading an ""alarming"" story, she knew what to say: ""I guess we might as well leave our [protest] signs by the front door."" The most visible action takes place on the streets, of course. But behind the scenes, people are connecting via social media, through Facebook groups like B Together, a Boston-based Trump resistance group that aims to advance causes that advocate for equality, racial justice, women's rights and more. Despite being private, it has attracted nearly 16,000 members since the election, said spokeswoman Robyn Parets. Members create their own events ‚Äî a group recently made ""pussy hats"" at a ""knit together"" ‚Äî and they also partner with nonprofits that have been advocating for rights even before Trump was elected. While many protestors focus on a single issue ‚Äî the environment, say, or press freedom or reproductive rights ‚Äî others say they are driven by a fear that's larger than any one cause. ""I am the third generation after the Holocaust and we were raised with this great awareness of our history,"" said Anne-Carina Kelly, a German native working to complete a master's degree in political science at Northeastern University. She is frightened by parallels she sees in the rise of Hitler and Trump she said, explaining her volunteer efforts. ""As a German, I can't look away and do nothing.""
