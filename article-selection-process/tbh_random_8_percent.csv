30,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Suspect in killing of two in Peabody caught in S.C. Murder suspect arrested in S.C.,"Accused of panhandling, he leads police to stolen car",,"Wes Doughty could be back in the state within a week. The North Shore man who is wanted in connection with a Peabody double murder and a Middleton carjacking made it 900 miles to South Carolina, where an arrest for panhandling at a busy intersection Friday afternoon led local deputies to discover his identity, law enforcement officials said. Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office investigators spotted 39-year-old Wes Doughty at 3:25 p.m. near a McDonald's and a Waffle House along Highway 9 in Boiling Springs, S.C., and arrested him for soliciting. When they ran his name through a national crime database, they learned he was wanted in the murders and carjacking and contacted Massachusetts authorities, according to the sheriff's office. Doughty will be arraigned Monday in South Carolina on a fugitive-from-justice charge. If he waives rendition, he will be returned to Massachusetts within the week, said Carrie Kimball-Monahan, a spokeswoman for the Essex district attorney's office.","BODY Ken Metz, the 64-year-old grandfather whom Doughty allegedly abducted at knifepoint in Metz's 2006 Honda Accord outside a Middleton restaurant Wednesday evening, said he was reassured to know Doughty was in custody. ""It's kind of a relief,"" Metz said by phone, minutes after the Middleton police visited him in person to inform him of Doughty's capture. Massachusetts officials initially released few details, but Peabody's police chief and mayor said they were ""anxious to assure the public that Mr. Doughty is in custody,"" in a joint statement issued Friday afternoon through the Essex district attorney's office. Doughty allegedly tied Metz up with a seat belt Wednesday and took him on a meandering course from the parking lot of Hailey's Restaurant and Pub to Boston. When Doughty stopped at a Tremont Street liquor store, Metz made his escape. During that three-hour ordeal, Metz said, Doughty confessed the killings to him and said he had been angry at the victims for giving heroin to his godfather. Metz said he tried to persuade Doughty not to harm him and to seek counseling. After he was arrested, Doughty led Spartanburg deputies to the stolen Honda in a nearby lot. Metz said he did not know when he would be reunited with his car or what condition it was in but was glad to know police had found it. The investigation began last Saturday night, after a woman alerted State Police about the bodies of 39-year-old Jennifer O'Connor and 37-year-old Mark Greenlaw in a home on Farm Avenue, in an isolated pocket of Peabody framed by an industrial area, marshy woodlands, and the split between Interstate 95 and Route 128. Police arrested one suspect in the killings, 45-year-old Michael Hebb, on Monday and announced their search for Doughty the next day, releasing his photo in a wanted bulletin. He surfaced briefly Wednesday night, when he allegedly carjacked Metz, and authorities quickly released a be-on-the-lookout alert for Doughty and the stolen Accord. One of Doughty's longtime neighbors said Friday that she was relieved that no one was hurt — officers, bystanders, and the suspect himself — in his capture. ""I'm just so glad that everybody's safe and sound,"" said the woman, who asked that only her first name, Winnie, be used. A day before, she had sat in the kitchen of her Belleview Avenue home in Middleton, beside the home where Doughty grew up and where his sister still lives, and issued this tearful appeal: ""Wessy, give yourself up. Don't keep running. It's not worth it. You can only get hurt."" Though she had not seen him for many years, she had fond memories of Doughty as a child, helping him with his homework and watching him assist her late husband in building a deck. ""He was just a good kid,"" Winnie said. ""Nobody in the neighborhood could believe this."" On Friday, Metz said his faith in God carried him through that experience, but his nerves were beginning to fray — until he learned that authorities had captured Doughty and found his car. ""The reality starts to set in after the shock wears off,"" said Metz, who raises money and coordinates faith-based social service projects in Peru for a living. ""I was starting to feel a little bit shaky today."" The owner of the pizza place where Metz fled after he escaped the car Wednesday night said Friday that he was happy to hear that Doughty had been caught and surprised he made it all the way to South Carolina. ""No kidding,"" said Taso Anastasiadis, owner of Good Eats, near the Roxbury-South End line. ""I'm glad. Justice will be served."" A lifelong friend of one of the murder victims, Greenlaw, said Friday that his friend's life had been rough and he had been in and out of trouble, but that nothing could have justified his violent death. ""I'm very happy [about the capture] because now his family can mourn their loss and get on. We'll never recover from what these sickos did to them, and there's nothing that will bring them back,"" said Joseph Gardner. Reached at home Friday evening, Mayor Junie White of Spartanburg said he had just learned of the arrest from watching television news. He said he was thrilled to learn police had apprehended Doughty. ""I'm happy they were able to capture him,"" said White. ""I don't know how our people knew, but I'm glad we got him off the streets. We got some outstanding policemen in our community. They're always on the ball."" Also on Friday, investigators returned to the area near the Peabody crime scene to search for more evidence. State Police detectives and agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were combing ""a swampy wooded area,"" said State Police spokesman David Procopio. The State Police Marine Unit and officers from the Peabody and Danvers police departments assisted with the search, while the state Department of Transportation was on scene to close a highway lane, said Stephen O'Connell, a spokesman for the Essex district attorney's office. An aerial photograph taken from Channel 7's helicopter and tweeted by the station appeared to show an agent removing what looked like a rifle or shotgun from an area of thick brush. Procopio and O'Connell said they could not discuss what authorities were looking for or what they found. Nestor Ramos and Mike Bello of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

0,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,Judge allows 2nd woman to testify at Cosby trial,Prosecutors wanted 13 accusers to take stand in assault case,,"Bill Cosby, 79, is to go on trial later this year. A judge ruled Friday that one additional woman who says Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her will be permitted to testify at his trial later this year on charges that he sexually assaulted a former Temple University staff member in 2004. Legal experts have said that the account of a second woman describing what she said was an act of sexual assault could strengthen the case against Cosby, 79, who has denied misconduct.","BODY But the judge's decision was far from a full victory for prosecutors in Montgomery County, Pa., who had sought to introduce testimony from 13 women who have accused Cosby of assaulting them. The prosecutors had told Judge Steven T. O'Neill of the Court of Common Pleas that the testimony of the group of women was important in showing a pattern of conduct by Cosby that bolstered the account of Andrea Constand, the former Temple employee. O'Neill agreed to allow the testimony of the one woman, identified only as ""Prior Alleged Victim Six,"" in a one-page decision that briefly discussed his legal reasoning. The judge said that he had considered the evidence, the legal arguments and aimed for ""a careful balancing of the probative value of the other acts evidence and the prejudice to the Defendant."" While the judge's decision was too brief to completely understand his reasoning, the account given by the woman is similar to that given by Constand, who says she was drugged and sexually assaulted at the entertainer's home near Philadelphia. Two years ago, the new witness appeared at a news conference, alongside her lawyer, Gloria Allred, where she was identified only as Kacey and described working as an assistant to Cosby's agent at the William Morris Agency in the 1990s. She and Cosby were friendly, she said, and once had dinner at his home where they both read from a script, their scene ending in a passionate kiss that made her uncomfortable. Then, she said, she went to lunch at his California hotel bungalow in 1996 where, she said, she passed out after he gave her a ""large white pill,"" and woke up in bed next to Cosby, who was naked beneath an open robe. The woman said at the news conference that she never pressed charges because she feared retaliation. Cosby has denied all the allegations of sexual assault and has described his encounter with Constand as consensual. His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, declined to comment on the ruling. Cosby's legal team is expected to challenge Constand's credibility. Legal experts said the judge's ruling made that job more difficult, but that the admittance of testimony from multiple women would have been significantly more damaging. ""He has two people to challenge rather than just one; in that sense, it's a defeat,"" said Dennis McAndrews, a Pennsylvania lawyer and former prosecutor. But, he added: ""If five or more had been admitted, it would have been devastating for his case. It is easier to attack the testimony of two."" Cosby's lawyers had fought to block the women's accounts, which had not been the subject of criminal complaints or adjudicated at trial, and which they disparaged as vague. ""There has never been a shred of physical evidence to support such claims, they have never been reported to any authority and today their stories of 'that night spent partying with a famous celebrity' are based solely on the tainted, unreliable memories of women, now in their senior years, recalling alleged events from a single encounter from the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s,"" his lawyers Brian J. McMonagle and Angela C. Agrusa said in court papers in October. For many of the women, testifying represented a final opportunity to confront Cosby legally. Most never came forward decades ago, when they say the episodes occurred, and have been unable to bring civil cases against Cosby because the statutes of limitation have expired. On Friday, Allred congratulated the 13, seven of whom were at least once her clients, saying, ""Even though they will not be able to testify in this case, they have been very important in the effort to seek justice."" In December, in another crucial decision, O'Neill ruled that deposition testimony, given by Cosby in a separate 2005 lawsuit filed by Constand, could be admitted as evidence in the coming criminal trial. In the deposition, Cosby admitted to affairs and acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his efforts to have sex with women.",['ENGLISH'],774,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-0092735c-fad8-11e6-a9de-2d222ca112fd,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000984', 'className': 'JUDGES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001555', 'className': 'SEX OFFENSES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000659', 'className': 'EVIDENCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001883', 'className': 'DECISIONS & RULINGS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001552', 'className': 'SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001712', 'className': 'TESTIMONY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009P0G', 'className': 'EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001849', 'className': 'WITNESSES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001149', 'className': 'MISCONDUCT'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000450', 'className': 'DATE RAPE DRUGS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'N711410KM', 'className': 'TALENT AGENTS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0009SFT', 'className': 'SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'N721110GM', 'className': 'HOTELS & MOTELS'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'ST0009QT8', 'className': 'CRIMINAL ASSAULT & BATTERY'}], 'company': [{'score': '53', 'classCode': 'CC0006E7H', 'className': 'WILLIAM MORRIS AGENCY INC'}], 'organization': [{'score': '91', 'className': 'TEMPLE UNIVERSITY'}], 'city': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX602', 'className': 'PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '53', 'className': 'SIC7922 THEATRICAL PRODUCERS (EXCEPT MOTION PICTURE) & MISCELLANEOUS THEATRICAL SERVICES'}], 'state': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GS154', 'className': 'PENNSYLVANIA, USA'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'person': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'PE000DHF1', 'className': 'BILL COSBY'}]}"

31,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,"1 lemonade, with a side of pot, delivered for $55",,,"HighSpeed Technology insists that its door-to-door juice and marijuana deliveries are legal under Massachusetts law.HighSpeed, which calls itself a technology startup, sells juice for $55. The accompanying marijuana is ""a very special gift,"" it says. A dark Toyota sedan rolls up to Globe headquarters in Dorchester at 6:15 p.m. Thursday. I'm awaiting a Jalapeno Lemonade delivery, which sounds refreshing on such an unseasonably warm winter day.","BODY The driver gets out, checks my ID to verify I'm 21 or older, and pops his trunk. He hands me a Tazo black tea lemonade. Then he gives me a small black bag of marijuana. The door-to-door service comes courtesy of HighSpeed, an online-only company that just started making deliveries in Boston and Cambridge, getting marijuana into the hands of consumers more than a year before sales are expected to be legal in the state. On Friday, the state's public safety agency urged district attorneys to investigate such transactions. Massachusetts' voter-passed pot law made growing, purchasing, possessing, and using limited amounts of marijuana legal as of Dec. 15. Sales remain forbidden until a marketplace regulated by the state begins in 2018. But giving away or transferring ""without remuneration"" up to 1 ounce of marijuana is legal as long asthe exchange is not advertised or promoted. So HighSpeed sells its Jalapeno Lemonade for $55, and, the company says in a press release, the marijuana is ""a very special gift"" with each purchase of its ""locally sourced"" and ""fresh-pressed"" juice. David Umeh, founder and chief executive of HighSpeed Technology Inc., which has been operating in Washington, D.C., for more than a year, insists his enterprise is on solid ground under theMassachusetts statute. ""The thing about HighSpeed: We're not a marijuana company. We're a technology startup. We're a delivery company. And we deliver juice,"" he said. ""In D.C., you can't sell it. In Boston, in Massachusetts, you can't sell it. But you can give cannabis as a gift, and that's what we do,"" he explained in a telephone interview. But the local authorities don't share that interpretation. Hours after I asked the state's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security about the legality of HighSpeed's sale, an official dispatched a letter to the office of every district attorney in Massachusetts. ""It has come to our attention that there are a number of individuals and businesses that are attempting to evade the Commonwealth's prohibition on the unlicensed sale of marijuana by engaging in organized sham transactions,"" wrote David M. Solet, chief legal counsel. He said that HighSpeed appears to be engaging in a ""sleight-of-hand"" with its juice delivery efforts. ""Obviously this is a thinly concealed scheme to obscure the illegal sale of marijuana by an unlicensed seller."" Asked about HighSpeed's delivery, Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, who prosecutes crime in Boston, said distributing marijuana without a license is unlawful. He said doing so could subject businesses to fines and expose their employees to the risk of arrest ""or, worse, armed robbery."" Purchasing and possessing limited quantities are legal. Asked generally about companies selling a product and offering consumers a ""gift"" of marijuana, Adam Fine, a lawyer who helped draft the legalization ballot measure, said that provision is intended to allow for a pot social scene. For example: People can bring and share a joint or two at a party without getting any compensation — just like they can bring and share a six-pack of beer. Without touching on specifics, Fine offered one reasonable test for the legality of giving away a gift of marijuana with another product: Is the cost of the item being sold in line with its normal price, its fair market value? The Tazo tea lemonade I paid for: $55. Tazo tea lemonade online: $1.27 plus shipping. (For reference, the marijuana gifted to me was an eighth of an ounce. A top recreational retailer in Colorado, where sales have been legal since 2014, sells that amount of its least expensive strain of marijuana for $15 on special and $20 at its ""everyday low price,"" according to the company's president. That, of course, does not include delivery.) Asked generally about officials who find his business illegal under Massachusetts law, Umeh said of the law: ""I think it's up for interpretation."" And, Umeh added, HighSpeed is not just about dollars and cents, but also about rebranding cannabis and helping to get rid of the negative stigma that surrounds the drug. HighSpeed is one of several efforts in Massachusetts to sell a product or service and then ""gift"" marijuana. In Springfield, one spotcharges a ""cover"" to get in and then offers people inside marijuana, according to a local news report. And there was that well-publicized Craigslist ad for empty plastic bags for sale with a ""gift"" of marijuana inside. Wherever such transfers fall under Massachusetts law — the state's judicial branch may end up being the ultimate arbiter — all such transactions are illegal under federal law. Possession and sale of any amount of marijuana is forbidden. Given the federal government's limited resources, personal possession of pot tends not to be a priority. But the Trump administration on Thursday raised the specter of a federal crackdown on recreational marijuana. Now to the important stuff: What happened to the HighSpeed pot I bought? To be reimbursed by the Globe for my purchase, I may have to hand over the black baggy for disposal. And that would be no gift at all.

28,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,North Korea's chemical arsenal in spotlight,Alleged use of nerve agent in killing is viewed as warning to world,,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — For years, North Korea has rattled the world with its nuclear tests and its threats to visit a nuclear holocaust upon the United States. Now, the finding by Malaysian police that Kim Jong Nam was assassinated with VX nerve agent is a stark reminder of the North's lesser-known weapons of mass destruction: a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. Kim, the estranged elder brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was killed Feb. 13 when two women rubbed his face with the nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the police said Friday.","BODY If North Korean nationals were indeed behind the killing, as Malaysian officials suggest, the use of VX raises several questions: Was the North Korean government using the attack to signal to the world its fearsome arsenal of such dangerous weapons? Or was the toxin simply an attempt to avoid detection in carrying out a brazen killing at one of the world's busiest airports? ""By using VX in an international airport in the heart of Asia, North Korea has sent a very clear message to the world that it will strike its enemies anywhere in the world,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on terrorism at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""It also demonstrates the North Korean response in the event of an attack against North Korea,"" Gunaratna said. North Korea's nuclear program has long been the most urgent concern of the United States and its allies, and the now-dormant six-party talks to curb the program did not address chemical and biological weapons. ""The reported use of VX reminds us that not only is the North's nuclear-missile threat serious but so are its asymmetric threats, including biochemical weapons and cyber that are all part of the regime's WMD tool kit,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. South Korea's Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed ""shock"" at the use of a chemical weapon and vowed to work with the international society to deal ""strongly"" with the violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The deadly use of a chemical weapon banned by international conventions could strengthen calls for the United States to put North Korea back on a list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, analysts said. The North was first put on the terrorist list after its bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in 1987, killing all 115 people onboard. But the United States delisted the country in 2008 as part of an agreement aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programs — a deal that has since disintegrated. After his announcement that Kim had been killed by VX nerve agent, Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police, said Friday that small amounts of the poison could have been brought into the country without being discovered. Two women have been arrested in the killing, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam. The attackers could have used a safety-enhancing battlefield form of the agent. Known as VX2, it is divided into two compounds that are harmless individually but become lethal when mixed together. If Kim's two assassins had each applied one component of VX, this would explain why two assassins were needed, how they survived the attack, and perhaps why it took 15 minutes or more for Kim to die.

4,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Harvard in the hunt,Crimson sweep Yale to maintain hopes of Ivy title,,"Harvard's Bryce Aiken (22 points) finds some room to operate in the first half. Lying stomach down on the hardwood, staring up as Harvard freshman guard Bryce Aiken got his feet together at the 3-point line, Yale freshman guard Miye Oni couldn't have been in a more helpless position. All he could do was look up at Aiken, who glanced down at him, knowing exactly what was coming next.","BODY As soon as Oni fell, losing his footing when Aiken quickly stopped at the 3-point line, Aiken had no choice but to pull the trigger. It's essentially an unwritten rule in basketball: If your defender falls, you have to put a shot up. ""Of course,"" Aiken said. Aiken waited a second, sized up the shot, then fired a 3-pointer that splashed through the nets. ""I guess I got him on the move,"" Aiken said. ""Actually, I was going to try to get it to the basket, but he fell. Then I was off balance. Then I just put it up."" While Oni was getting up, Aiken waved at the Crimson fan section that had come alive as Harvard was putting Yale to sleep. Aiken's three came in the middle of a 32-12 second-half storm by the Crimson that helped them put the Bulldogs away, 77-64, on Friday night at Lavietes Pavillion. The Crimson (17-7, 9-2 Ivy) swept their series with the Bulldogs (14-10, 6-5) after being swept by Yale a year ago. ""I thought it was a highly competitive game between two teams that are certainly playing for a lot of different reasons,"" said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. ""They're such a tough team to defend, especially on the backboard. We knew that and how hard they were going to be on the offensive glass."" Aiken, who torched Yale for 27 points two weeks ago in New Haven, put up 22 more on Friday, knocking down 7 of 14 shots and going 5 of 8 from three. ""As we've seen, he can create a lot,"" Amaker said. ""He's very crafty and dynamic with the ball and his shot-making ability changes because of his size. He's a hard guard in terms of how do you rush out on him, [he has] ball skills and craftiness to go by you and make a play. He can be a dynamic offensive player and certainly we've seen that throughout the season."" Coming into the game, Yale had the second-best scoring offense in the Ivy League and led the conference in rebounding and offensive rebounding, so the points of emphasis were obvious for the Crimson. That didn't stop the Bulldogs from grabbing 24 rebounds (seven offensive) in the first half. ""It wasn't good,"" Amaker said. ""I thought we did obviously a pretty darn good job defensive rebounding for the most part, but we gave up 12 offensive rebounds [total]. I was disappointed in that. That's what I thought was the difference in the first half for their team, getting the extra opportunities. They didn't cash in as many, thank goodness, because I think that would've been the difference in the game."" Between senior big man Zena Edosomwan (four rebounds, two blocks) and freshmen forwards Chris Lewis (six rebounds) and Seth Towns (eight rebounds), the Crimson tightened up on the glass in the second half, neutralizing Yale's biggest strength. In the meantime, Harvard's front line did the bulk of the damage on offense. Towns gave the Crimson 18 points, and Edosomwan added 15 points. ""We take pride in that,"" Towns said. ""We didn't do it in the first half. In the second half, we did."" Even though they've already secured a spot in the Ivy League's first postseason tournament, the Crimson are still hunting for the regular-season title. They sit two games behind first-place Princeton, which pummeled Columbia on the road, 64-45. Amaker took extra time after the game to talk to his team about the importance of the Crimson's final home game of the season. ""We just talked right away about trying to close out the weekend the right way,"" Amaker said. ""And I wanted them to understand what that means, the spirit of senior day and you can't just expect or assume things are going to go our way because this is the way it's supposed to go. We have to prepare the right way and I just mentioned to our guys, let's start that right now.""

President Jacob Zuma appealed for calm and condemned the latest wave of anti-foreigner violence to grip South Africa in recent years. ""Many citizens of other countries living in South Africa are law-abiding and contribute to the economy of the country positively,"" Zuma said. ""It is wrong to brand all nonnationals as drug dealers or human traffickers,"" he said. ""Let us isolate those who commit such crimes and work with government to have them arrested, without stereotyping and causing harm to innocent people."" Africans coming legally and illegally to South Africa, which has the continent's most advanced economy, have been the focus of criticism and resentment and sometimes of violent attacks in recent years. South Africans accuse migrants of stealing jobs or exploiting locals by running small businesses in poor, black townships. Others blame foreigners for the country's high crime rates. The accusations, which are not backed up by official statistics, resonate in a country with a jobless rate of 27 percent and yawning income inequalities. The latest anti-immigrant violence began in a neighborhood south of Johannesburg called Rosettenville, where residents burned down a dozen houses that they said were being used by Nigerians as drug dens and brothels. The attacks spread to other areas, including in Pretoria, where immigrant areas and businesses were targeted.

49,"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,Kids who feel positive about math do better,,,"A fifth-grade instructor goes over an equation during math class at Dever Elementary School in Boston. Some kids moan when asked to do math homework; others chatter about what they learned in class that day. A student's feelings toward math — and perhaps other subjects — can impact his or her classroom achievement over time, according to a long-term study of middle-school students.","BODY Regardless of a student's intelligence or economic background, those who took pride in and enjoyed math had better grades over time during the study, while performance spiraled downward for those experiencing anger, anxiety, or shame about the subject. ""Emotions are a powerful driver of students' learning,"" says study author Reinhard Pekrun, a professor of psychology at the University of Munich in Germany. The findings, published this month in the journal Child Development, should encourage parents, teachers, and administrators to bolster positive emotions and reduce negative emotions when it comes to math, says Pekrun. And that doesn't mean putting on a smile every time you talk about fractions. Clear, enthusiastic instruction — during which a student is engaged rather than anxious or bored — can promote a self-reinforcing path to academic success. The study relied on data from the Project for the Analysis of Learning and Achievement in Mathematics, or PALMA, which followed 3,425 German students from a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds during grades 5 through 9. Researchers tracked students' grades and math test scores, and gave them a survey each year to probe their feelings about the subject. Other studies have examined the link between learning and children's emotions, but most focused on a single moment in time, such as one day or week of learning. The PALMA study, on the other hand, tracked learning and the effect of emotion over years. Overall, the results were as one might expect: Positive emotions were beneficial to learning while negative emotions were detrimental. Yet they do contradict the theory that if you enjoy something, you might not put as much effort into it. During five years of schooling, students with high intelligence had good grades and test scores, but those who also enjoyed and felt proud about their math work had even higher achievement. And students who experienced negative emotions — anger, anxiety, shame, boredom, you name it — were more likely to have lower achievement. The findings held true no matter a child's economic background, gender, or general intelligence, and the correlations got stronger as the years went on. ""Students who get positive feedback develop positive emotions, learn better, and their enjoyment further increases,"" says Pekrun. ""For those who are bored or anxious, performance deteriorates, they get negative feedback, become even more anxious or hopeless, and continue to spiral downward."" Educators can prevent negative feedback loops, and promote positive ones by being knowledgeable, and not anxious, about their subject or those emotions can pass onto the children, says Pekrun. He also suggests that teachers avoid competitive evaluations, which creates winners and losers, thereby sparking negative emotions in the latter. ""It drives too many students into states of panic, anxiety, hopelessness and, in the end, boredom,"" says Pekrun. ""And boredom is the prime cause for failed education.""

""Look at the populist movement in the late 19th century, when American farmers started a grassroots movement attempting to challenge the power of big corporate interests and banks,"" she said. ""There were marches of unemployed people who came to Washington during the Depression in the 1890s to protest their situation, and the civil rights movement."" But, Fitzpatrick said, there is a difference this time: The administration's alleged connections to a foreign power that for much of the Cold War was considered an enemy. ""We're in entirely new territory."" Indeed, Tiziana C. Dearing, a Boston College professor and co-director of the school's Center for Social Innovation, says many people have been spurred to action because they feel that Trump poses an ""existential threat."" ""There aren't a lot of formal levers to counter that threat,"" Dearing said. ""And if you don't have formal levers, people take to the streets."" And many of those people include children, as parents fit protest actions into the family schedule, working in resistance in between cello lessons, sports, and homework. Protesting has become such a part of Cambridge writer Katherine Wolff's family routine that when one of her 12-year-old twins heard mom sigh after reading an ""alarming"" story, she knew what to say: ""I guess we might as well leave our [protest] signs by the front door."" The most visible action takes place on the streets, of course. But behind the scenes, people are connecting via social media, through Facebook groups like B Together, a Boston-based Trump resistance group that aims to advance causes that advocate for equality, racial justice, women's rights and more. Despite being private, it has attracted nearly 16,000 members since the election, said spokeswoman Robyn Parets. Members create their own events — a group recently made ""pussy hats"" at a ""knit together"" — and they also partner with nonprofits that have been advocating for rights even before Trump was elected. While many protestors focus on a single issue — the environment, say, or press freedom or reproductive rights — others say they are driven by a fear that's larger than any one cause. ""I am the third generation after the Holocaust and we were raised with this great awareness of our history,"" said Anne-Carina Kelly, a German native working to complete a master's degree in political science at Northeastern University. She is frightened by parallels she sees in the rise of Hitler and Trump she said, explaining her volunteer efforts. ""As a German, I can't look away and do nothing.""

45,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Bruins' Sweeney: No deal for rentals,,,"LOS ANGELES — Don Sweeney's shopping list ahead of Wednesday's NHL trade deadline does not have the Boston general manager looking to acquire end-of-season rentals. His Bruins are still not in the Eastern Conference playoff picture, so he'd like to add players — ideally a left-shooting defenseman and a goal-scoring winger — but is adamant about holding on to the bunch of talented teenagers he believes can be in Boston one day soon. But how soon? The NHL regular season ends April 8 (43 days and counting) and the fight to get in the playoffs could be lost before a kid from college or junior hockey — take BU blueliner Charlie McAvoy, for instance — walks through that door with a ""ready-to-play"" label dangling from his elbow.","BODY ""It's a long way away from Craig Janney and Bob Joyce coming in as a little bit older players,"" said Sweeney, recalling when those two forwards reported to the Causeway Street varsity straight from their 1988 Olympic squads. ""But again, you never know. Chris Kreider did leave school (at age 21), went into the playoffs for the Rangers and played well."" The trade market began to shift Thursday when the Penguins, injury-depleted along the back line, picked up veteran defenseman Ron Hainsey (read: pure rental at age 35) from the Hurricanes. The defending Stanley Cup champs gave up a 26-year-old forward prospect, Danny Kristo, and a second-round pick for Hainsey, the former Canadiens' first-round pick from Connecticut. ""It didn't surprise me that Pittsburgh would be aggressive,"" said Sweeney, ""given the injuries (including Trevor Daley) that they've had."" The Pens are positioned much differently than the Bruins. They are fresh from their Cup win last June, and still have some of the most dynamic, prolific scorers in the game in the likes of Sidney Crosby, Evgeny Malkin, and ex-Bruin Phil Kessel. Hainsey could be the dollop of epoxy general manager Jim Rutherford needed to allow Daley time to return for a long Cup run. Sweeney's Black-and-Gold squad, meanwhile, isn't on anyone's list of '17 Cup threats. Hainsey, a left-handed shot could have helped, but probably would not be the difference between a playoff spot and a third consecutive DNQ. Ideally, said Sweeney, if there's a deal to be made, one to tempt him to give up picks and/or a prospect, it would be for a player he could see fitting into the lineup for 2-3 years. As painful as it can be at times, particularly with young players close to making it, but not quite there, he is in build mode and not in the strike-while-the-Cup-is-there-to-clinch mode. Just a year ago, he refused to part with Loui Eriksson, believing in late February that he had a club that could contend for a Cup. Then came the post-deadline collapse, a second spring with no playoffs at the Garden, and then watching Eriksson (11-11—22 this season) bolt as a free agent to the Canucks. ""We were in a good position at least to get in and see where we were going to go,"" recalled Sweeney. ""People speculated as to what Loui Eriksson might have garnered for us, from a total tear-down. To me, the team was in a position to reserve the right to try to get in and see if they could play. Loui was a big part of that, clearly . . . again, you learn, you definitely have to look in the mirror and realize you didn't execute at the level you wanted."" Which isn't to say, in hindsight, said Sweeney, that he would have flipped Eriksson. ""I don't regret not making the move,"" he added, ""because I know what was being offered if I was going to go down that road, and to me it wasn't worth losing the opportunity of getting in and what the players had worked for. It wasn't anywhere near close, to be perfectly honest."" Instead, Sweeney picked up a pair of veterans in defenseman John-Michael Liles and forward Lee Stempniak. Their impact was minimal, not nearly enough to make up for a fatigued, threadbare goalie in Tuukka Rask and a forward corps (even with Eriksson aboard) lacking in meaningful secondary scoring. At the moment, Rask looks rested and poised for a six-week push. Backup Anton Khudobin turned in a second straight win Thursday, a fine 27-stop effort vs the Kings. At this time of year, that's a gift-wrapped six-pack of 5-Hour Energy for Rask, who'll be back in net Sunday vs. the Stars after 72 hours rest. The tight-lipped Sweeney, as expected, would not offer any specific names on his potential target list. But when he identifies a scoring winger as a priority, it's an easy leap to figure 35-year-old Czech Radim Vrbata would be a prime target. Vrbata is on an expiring deal with the bad Coyotes, and is also their top scorer, albeit with a humble line of 13-29—42. Vrabata would fit in with fellow Czechs David Krejci and David Pastrnak, and Slovaks Zdeno Chara and Peter Cehlarik. ""I won't comment on any players,"" said Sweeney, when asked specifically about Vrbata. ""Without getting myself in trouble . . . from a depth perspective and a scoring perspective, those are the types of players that would fit in up and down the lineup to be able to offer depth and scoring for sure."" The Bruins had the day off Friday in Dallas. They'll practice Saturday morning, report to work early for Sunday's matinee (12:30 p.m. on NBC) and return to the Hub of Hockey to face the Coyotes Tuesday night on Causeway Street. Upon leaving the Garden that night, the Bruins will have but 19 games remaining on the schedule, perhaps on the season. No matter what happens, Sweeney plans to stick to his patient, build-first model. ""I am not going to be short-sighted,"" he said.

55,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Obits,"Larry Coryell, 73; master guitar player flitted among genres",,,"Mr. Coryell's late 1960s albums ""Coryell"" and ""Spaces"" were regarded as milestones in jazz fusion. WASHINGTON — Larry Coryell, a guitarist of stunning technique who defied and redefined musical boundaries as a leader of the movement fusing jazz and rock in the late 1960s and 1970s, died Sunday at a hotel in Manhattan. He was 73. Mr. Coryell, who lived in Orlando, was performing at the Iridium jazz club on the weekend of his death. The cause was complications from arteriosclerosis, said his wife, singer-songwriter Tracey Piergross.","BODY For a half-century, Mr. Coryell was a much-in-demand sideman and leader. He was heralded on the cover of Downbeat magazine at 24 and had attracted a following ever since in a career marked by jaw-dropping range, including opera compositions. He forged his reputation on the musical vanguard in the late 1960s with a run of albums such as ""Coryell"" and ""Spaces,"" which were regarded as milestones in jazz fusion. They embraced the psychedelic rock experimentation popularized by the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix and helped set the groundwork for Miles Davis's popular jazz-fusion album ""Bitches Brew"" (1970) and such bands as Weather Report and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. One of Mr. Coryell's groups was called the Free Spirits, a testament to the energetic abandon and tasteful distortion he brought to jazz. He helped usher in a revolution in the musical form, which had not undergone such a jolt since the beboppers of the 1940s made the big bands seem passe. In 1969, New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett proclaimed him ""without question the most inventive and original guitarist to appear since Charlie Christian,"" the improvisational electric guitarist of the 1940s. Guitarist Al Di Meola, one of Mr. Coryell's admirers, dubbed him ""the godfather of fusion,"" a movement that helped make jazz more commercial after the British rock invasion. As much as he helped bring fusion into the mainstream, Mr. Coryell's prolific recording career encompassed a far wider cut of the musical pie. He initially drew attention for his jagged, amped-up electric guitar experiments, but he was deeply schooled in the work of Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel, and Johnny Smith, straight-ahead jazz guitarists of exquisite, understated skill. Mr. Coryell also spent years following in their melodic acoustic footsteps, a world away from his work with fusion. He toured in the mid-1980s with fellow guitarists Farlow, John Abercrombie, Larry Carlton, and John Scofield for the popular Jazzvisions concert series. Over the years, he teamed with musicians including jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, saxophonist Sonny Rollins, Belgian jazz guitarist Philip Catherine, and Brazilian composer and singer Dorival Caymmi. He also recorded demanding works by Igor Stravinsky, including ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""The Firebird,"" as well as classical Indian music. Lorenz Albert Van Delinder III was born in Galveston, Texas, and was deaf in his right ear. His father, whom he later described as ""a musician who chased a lot of women,"" abandoned the family. He grew up in Richland, Wash., with his mother and stepfather, a chemical engineer who adopted him and gave him the surname Coryell. He sang in the local Presbyterian Church choir, picked up ukulele at 12, and became enamored of rock guitar in his teens, mimicking Chuck Berry and Chet Atkins. He told People magazine that he was the ""black sheep"" of his family, running away at 16 to join a rock band and getting a girlfriend named Georgia pregnant; she gave the baby up for adoption. He enrolled at the University of Washington, studying journalism in case his musical prospects cratered. He wound up playing backup to such stars as Roy Orbison and Bobby Vee and decided to quit college in 1965. He moved across the country to make his name in New York City nightclubs. His confidence was rewarded. Within months, he was a playing and recording as a member of Chico Hamilton's chamber jazz band. He was also showcased on several albums with vibraphonist Gary Burton, notably the early fusion LP ""Duster"" (1967), and on jazz flutist Herbie Mann's album ""Memphis Underground"" (1968), another bold riposte to jazz purism with its use of a Southern R&B section. Mr. Coryell, who also played dates with Davis and fellow jazz giant Thelonious Monk, formed a succession of jazz-rock bands, including Foreplay and Eleventh House, that were popular attractions. But he said his ""chameleonlike"" tastes for music, from electric to unplugged, from the avant-garde to the traditional, undermined his commercial prospects in a marketplace that valued consistency. Meanwhile, his finances plummeted because of his decadent lifestyle, an indulgence in the drug- and sex-experimentation counterculture that he once called his ""orgy stage."" He had ready access to heroin, LSD, cocaine, and alcohol. ""I was a hurtin' buckaroo,"" he told the publication Canadian Christianity. He completed rehab in 1981 and became a disciple of Nichiren Buddhism, which involves chanting. Mr. Coryell's eclectic career continued apace even in his most desperate years, working variously with jazz-rock guitarist John McLaughlin, flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía, bassist Charles Mingus, and pianist Cedar Walton. His marriages to Julie Nathanson, an author and singer who once managed his career, and Molly Schueler ended in divorce. Besides Piergross, Mr. Coryell leaves two sons from his first marriage, Murali of Boiceville, N.Y., and Julian of Los Angeles; a daughter from his second marriage, Allegra of Brooklyn; a daughter from a relationship, Annie White of Arvada, Colo.; a half brother and a half sister; and six grandsons. He remained creatively restless over the past three decades, reinventing himself through periods immersed in bebop and smooth jazz. He wrote operas based on works by Leo Tolstoy and James Joyce.

9,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,J.C. Penney to close over 100 stores this year,,,"The J.C. Penney Co. on Friday said it plans to close between 130 and 140 stores in the next several months, a move that makes it the latest retail stalwart to pull back from the mall amid the rise of online shopping.","BODY The department store giant's latest quarterly results, also released Friday, illustrate its struggle to connect with shoppers: Sales were down 0.7 percent at stores open more than a year. And yet the report also demonstrated that the chain, unlike department store rivals such as Macy's and Sears, has had improving momentum lately. The company managed to deliver a net profit in 2016, the first time it has done so since 2010. J.C. Penney's decision to close stores comes as many industry executives and analysts say that old-school chains are ""overstored,"" meaning they have too many locations for the era of online shopping. Macy's is in the process of closing 100 stores and eliminating some 10,000 jobs. Sears said in January it would close 150 stores, some from its namesake chain, and some from the Kmart chain. Marvin Ellison, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that J.C. Penney is slashing stores because ""we believe we must take aggressive action to better align our retail operations for sustainable growth."" The company is set to disclose in mid-March which locations it is to shut down. J.C. Penney said the affected stores account for less than 5 percent of total sales. It expects the closures will result in $200 million of annual cost savings. It is not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected by the closures. The company says it will offer a voluntary early retirement package to 6,000 employees.

5,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,'Walden' video game encourages change of pace,,,"It's certainly a long way from ""Grand Theft Auto."" Henry David Thoreau's classic ""Walden"" is the inspiration for what Smithsonian magazine is calling ""the world's most improbable video game"": ""Walden, a Game."" Instead of offering the thrills of stealing, violence, and copious cussing, the new video game, based on Thoreau's 19th-century retreat in Massachusetts, will urge players to collect arrowheads, cast their fishing poles into a tranquil pond, buy penny candies, and perhaps even jot notes in a journal — all while listening to music, nature sounds, and excerpts from the author's meditations.","BODY While the game is all about simplicity, it has been in development for nearly a decade. The lead designer, Tracy J. Fullerton, director of the Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, came up with the idea as a way to reinforce our connection to the natural world and to challenge our hurried culture. ""Games are kinds of rehearsals,"" Fullerton said in an interview. ""It might give you pause in your real life: Maybe instead of sitting on my cellphone, rapidly switching between screens, I should just go for a walk."" The game — which Fullerton said is likely to cost $19.99 — takes six hours to play. It starts in the summer and ends one year later — offering players tasks such as building a cabin, planting beans, or chatting, virtually of course, with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Should you not leave sufficient time for contemplation, or work too hard, the game cautions: ""Your inspiration has become low, but can be regained by reading, attending to sounds of life in the distance, enjoying solitude, and interacting with visitors, animal and human."" Failure to heed the warning will result in a dimming of color and thinning of music. ""You can choose how to spend your time, what to emphasize, the ways the game can play out,"" Fullerton said. ""You might spend all your time in the woods, you might focus on bean farming, you could become a famous author — sending off articles to your editor, Horace Greeley — or you could become an activist, working on the Underground Railroad."" At a time when the most popular video games include the active participation of the player — slay that knight and you can enter the castle — the ""Walden"" game seems passive by contrast. But Fullerton said it's no simple stroll in the park. Players who fail to forage for food, for example, will start to faint in the game. The goal is not to win in any competitive sense, but to achieve work-life balance. ""You're not only trying to survive, you're seeking inspiration in the woods,"" Fullerton said, ""If you spend all of your time grinding away on survival tasks, the environment will become less lush. The winning is based on whether you meet your own goals."" The project has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Guardians of Thoreau's legacy say it could introduce ""Walden"" to a whole new audience. ""These are people who are interested in interactive games,"" said Kathi Anderson, executive director of the Walden Woods Project in Massachusetts. ""Maybe they're not the same as the people who would sit down and read Thoreau's book.""",['ENGLISH'],546,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-0f5fa7b2-faf9-11e6-9753-29652d23228d,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000351', 'className': 'COMPUTER GAMES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DL3M', 'className': 'MOBILE GAMES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N712110MM', 'className': 'MUSEUMS & GALLERIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009JXS', 'className': 'ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000A5KE', 'className': 'FILM SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'N111100CC', 'className': 'GRAIN & OILSEED FARMING'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001859', 'className': 'WORK-LIFE BALANCE'}, {'score': '51', 'classCode': 'ST000A0Z7', 'className': 'MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES'}], 'organization': [{'score': '56', 'className': 'UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}]}"
47,"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,Detangling the world of wireless earbuds,,,"It's expected that virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019.Left: Powerbeats3 from Dr. Dre's Beats. Below: SkyBuds If you were one of the many who moaned over news that iPhones — starting with the most recent model 7 — would no longer sport an old-school headphone jack, and would instead force you into the untested wild of wireless earbuds, I feel you. Even though I hated untangling those damn earphones, I loved the jack. I'm an analog guy at heart, with no problems with wires or cables, and plenty of skepticism toward the integrity of an audio signal scattered into bits and cast through the air.","BODY Trends in technology render me an outlier on this front. For one thing, HRA — high-resolution audio — is experiencing a boom right now in mobile devices and home listening systems. And wireless is playing an essential part; the consulting firm Futuresource predicts that ""virtually all home audio devices will be wireless by 2019."" For now, Apple is pushing its sizeable base of devoted users off the wireless cliff — and its recent joining of the Wireless Power Consortium hints at a forthcoming form of cord-cutting. This kind of suddenly open market has inspired a veritable hailstorm of wireless earbuds vying to knock Apple's proprietary Airpods out of your ears, which, honestly, isn't that difficult to do. Airpods, by the way, are actually pretty good. They boast crisp, clear, full sound; their connectivity with linked devices is solid and seamless; and the tap-based interface (to power on or off, or launch Siri) takes a familiar Appley approach to defining gestural standards for the rest of the field. As for battery life, they're good for 5 hours of listening — or 24 if you've got the charging case handy. (We know how these battery life love stories tend to end, however.) Despite a fair amount of teasing across the memescape, Airpods caught on big. But a whole gang of other buds are showing up, each with its own special something. Dr. Dre's Beats audio line, now a subset of Apple, came out with its own Bluetooth-enabled wirelesss headphones, the Powerbeats3. Designed for exercise and active use, the earbuds hook over the ears and tether behind the head. True to the Beats brand, they boast a broad, booty-friendly dynamic range, perfect for overpowering whatever garbage your spin instructor is blasting. Bose's similarly designed SoundSport headphones are also made specifically for distraction-free use during exercise. Coming from a company that made half my family look like air traffic controllers, the SoundSports feel like a step in the light direction. And while big brands like Sony, Sennheiser, and LG are all getting in on the action, some of the more intriguing entries into the bud-verse come from lesser known companies or ground-up crowdsourcing campaigns. Skybuds, for example, originally launched as a Kickstarter project that imagined a case for your phone that could also charge and store your earbuds. The final product features a more practical slim case design, and puts emphasis on clear sound and a snug fit. Bragi — the German startup whose identity-challenged The Dash headphones (another Kickstarter alum) made a big impact on the wireless world — has returned with its more focused sophomore effort, The Headphone. Notable for their sound quality and their easy (and smooshy) on-bud playlist and volume controls, The Headphone also sports a cool ""audio transparency"" feature, which doesn't so much quiet your music as diffuse it, allowing in a little bit of the world around you — including the cashier, who appreciates that. The Headphone hints at one of the more exciting opportunities to explore in the expanding wireless earbud space — augmented reality. The freshly released Here One system from Doppler Labs, for instance, doesn't just deliver high-quality streaming audio and phone calls through its Here Buds, it employs a connected app to let users filter and adjust the sound around them. That could mean using EQ controls to further dampen a noisy baby on a plane, or smooth down the squeal of the Green Line. It could also mean using one of a suite of ""smart audio filters"" that can tamp down a jet engine or boost a friend's voice at a noisy cafe. Early reviews suggest the Here One is still working out some kinks in connectivity quality (and it should be noted that all of these products, this whole wide wireless world, is still working out kinks), but the promise of this technology is more profound than just sunglasses for your ears. The next time your kids pop in their earbuds while you're talking to them, you can reasonably conclude they're listening more closely than ever.

The 28-year-old is out of minor league options, so if Brentz is not on the final roster, the Sox will have to designate him for assignment. That means he will be traded, claimed off waivers or released. ""I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it,"" Brentz said. ""I get what the process is but it really doesn't bother me. I've been blessed to play this game longer than I ever thought. Baseball was supposed to be an avenue to a free education. I never thought it would turn into this."" It could take days before Brentz learns where he will play baseball this season. If he clears waivers, the Sox could even retain him and send him back to Triple A Pawtucket. But manager John Farrell doesn't believe that will happen. Brentz is a righthanded hitter with power, a commodity many teams lack. Scouts will watch him closely this spring. ""He's got major league power. I think he's made some tangible adjustments with his two-strike approach, where he cut his swing down a little bit,"" Farrell said. ""Because of his ability, because of what he's done in shorter stints at the big-league level, I would assume that there's going to be interest if [he's] not here by Opening Day."" Brentz was a supplemental first-round pick in 2010. He had 42 home runs in his final two seasons at Middle Tennessee State and has since hit 97 for the Sox, all but one in the minors.  Brentz played in 25 games for the Sox last season, starting 18. He contributed to some victories and took satisfaction in the Sox returning to the playoffs. He is a career .287 hitter with the Sox over 34 games and has a .690 OPS. ""I stay positive. There's so much failure in the game that I always try and stay positive,"" Brentz said. ""There's a lot of frustration in baseball. It's a tough game mentally. My thing has always been to help the team when my number is called."" Brentz believes his best baseball is still to come. He has worked with a private coach, former minor league player Josh Renick, on trusting his hands to get the bat to the ball. His swing feels more natural now and less mechanical. ""I had a leg kick at the beginning of last year and that didn't work. I just had to trust my hands. Every hitting coach I've even had has said that. But I always felt there had to be some better way,"" Brentz said. ""I finally got tired of thinking so much."" Brentz hopes there's a way he somehow stays with the Sox. He has long-standing relationships with several of the coaches and many of the players. Work any job for seven years and it feels like home. For a baseball player, it's even more so given the shared travel and emotional ups and downs. ""Boston has been good to me. It's all I've known,"" Brentz said. ""I've had injuries and that's part of life. I've dealt with it. I've tried to play hard and play the game right and if I do that I go home and sleep well at night. ""It would be tough to say goodbye. But I just want to be on a team I know I can help. I'd love it to be here but if it's somewhere else, that's fine, too. It's a business.  When he met with Brentz earlier this month, Farrell detected a player with a better sense of who he was. ""He came up with a better understanding of what his abilities are and how they best perform, particularly at the plate,"" the manager said. ""Players go through phases and at the end of this camp there's kind of a 'Y' in the road for him. Is it remaining here or is it elsewhere? They realize the only thing that can be affected is what they do between the lines."" Brent got married a few years ago and is eager to start a family. But for the next few weeks, he'll wonder what comes next and where home will be this summer. ""We'll see what happens. I hope somebody wants me,"" he said. ""I do know that I played this game longer than a lot of people. I don't take that for granted.""

54,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Foreign,US air controllers move closer to combat in Mosul,Allows for faster airstrike launches,,"With the grinding battle for east Mosul all but over, Iraqi troops in recent days have begun their advance into the Islamic State-held western portion of the city, crossing the Tigris river and driving up from the south toward Mosul's airport.","BODY Backed by the US-led coalition's airstrikes, artillery, Special Operations forces, and hundreds of advisers, Iraqi troops are expected to encounter heavy resistance as they enter western Mosul's labyrinth of alleyways, tight side streets, and multistory buildings. This dense urban terrain, compounded with the presence of thousands of civilians, has forced US forces to adjust their tactics to better aid Iraqi troops. One of the key strategies that the US military has changed in recent weeks is the protocol for calling in airstrikes. This means that the troops responsible for talking to US and coalition aircraft have moved closer to the front lines. Friday, the Associated Press reported that this change occurred toward the end of December as Iraqi forces were nearing the end of their operation to take eastern Mosul. While the move puts US forces in greater danger, it will likely make Iraqi operations more effective and ultimately reduce their casualties. In the past, as US forces helped take other parts of Iraq from the Islamic State, the method for calling in airstrikes was a lengthier process that involved the Iraqi forces calling back to a joint command center, or strike cell, with their request. Within that strike cell were US service members certified to talk and direct US and Western aircraft to the Iraqis' target. Those US service members are known as joint terminal attack controllers, or JTACs. After looking at drone and surveillance feeds of the Iraqi forces and their intended target, the JTACs would direct the aircraft to the area. Once it was confirmed that the Iraqis, the JTACs — through their drone feeds — and the aircraft were all looking at the same thing, US officers and Iraqi officers would approve the strike. The Pentagon has previously argued that this method was effective for helping Iraqi troops, but as the battle for eastern Mosul has dragged on against entrenched Islamic State fighters, the advancing Iraqi forces required a faster way for calling in airstrikes. In turn, the JTACs have been pushed closer to the front, in positions close enough where they can observe both the targets the Iraqis are attacking and the coalition aircraft as they release their weapons. Lieutenant Colonel John Dorrian, the spokesman for the US-led coalition, said that this means the role for the JTACs is now more traditional, and similar to what was seen during the height of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the approval for the strikes has been pushed to lower levels, meaning that the decision to drop the bombs — once made by senior officers at locations removed from the fighting — is now being made by US and Iraqi officers near the front lines, Dorrian said. It is unclear if the change will help reduce civilian casualties in the fight to retake Mosul.",['ENGLISH'],509,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-bf4bdb20-faca-11e6-a9de-2d222ca112fd,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'N928110MM', 'className': 'ARMED FORCES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001814', 'className': 'WAR & CONFLICT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000301', 'className': 'CIVIL AVIATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DFND', 'className': 'ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ & THE LEVANT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D170', 'className': 'BOMBINGS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N488100CC', 'className': 'AIRPORTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000342', 'className': 'COMPANY STRATEGY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DGXY', 'className': 'ARTILLERY & ORDNANCE'}], 'country': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'GC358', 'className': 'IRAQ'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC508', 'className': 'AFGHANISTAN'}]}"
16,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Walsh affirms Boston's role as sanctuary city,"Says at mosque, 'We're doing the right thing'",,"Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh offered a passionate defense of immigration and religious diversity at the city's largest mosque Friday night during a forum to hear the fears and concerns raised by the Trump administration's executive orders regarding immigration and refugees. The mayor struck a defiant stance in discussing Boston's status as a sanctuary city, even though the Trump administration has warned that communities that offer sanctuary protections for undocumented immigrants could endanger their federal funding.","BODY ""I'm not afraid of losing money, first of all because we have the Constitution on our side, and secondly, we're doing the right thing here in the city of Boston,"" he said at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center. He added later: ""If people want to criticize me for this . . . there's an election in November."" The event was the first in a series of forums the Mayor's Office for Immigrant Advancement plans to hold to address immigrant and refugee needs. The mayor brought with him officials from a number of departments to answer questions and heard stories from people who attended. One young woman, Nour Tabidi, the American-born daughter of Sudanese refugees, told the mayor about how she and her new husband, a Sudanese national, were temporarily prevented from traveling back to the United States because of a Trump administration travel ban affecting seven Muslim-majority countries. ""I was so scared that we'd have to start the visa process all over again, the idea that I would be separated from my dad and my siblings in the US or separated from my husband in Sudan,"" she said. Rahmatullah Aka, an Afghan man who helps resettle refugees, spoke about the anxiety and distress within families who remain separated from their relatives. ""We are trying to help them to focus so they can become part of the society but they have this stress and these questions with them"" about how long they will be separated from their families, Aka said. Some people spoke about larger problems with the immigration system. Khalid Alsobhi, who has been living alone in his Belmont home for two months, said his wife and three children traveled to Saudi Arabia in December to visit relatives and renew their F-1 visas, which had expired. All four of their new visa applications were rejected. Alsobhi's children, ages 13, 11, and 5, attend Belmont public schools and have now missed several weeks of class. His wife, a community health student, is undergoing cancer treatment and just missed an appointment last week. ""I do cry, really, because I'm a human being, but I show myself strong,"" he said in an interview later. ""I'm not giving up until my kids are here."" Walsh expressed concern about children feeling fear in the Boston schools and about people being afraid to confide in police officers. He spoke about his own parents, who emigrated from Ireland in the 1950s, and he urged those gathered to get to know their neighbors to dispel stereotypes and foster understanding. The mayor also asked everyone to contact their senators and representatives in Congress to demand comprehensive immigration reform. ""They need to hear these stories,"" he said. ""The correction of immigration should not be a Democratic or Republican issue."" The mayor is heading into a reelection campaign this fall; politically, his stance on immigration has allowed him to consolidate support from liberal voters as he fends off a challenge from City Councilor Tito Jackson, who had planned to attack Walsh from the left. The city's Muslim community is on edge as it awaits a new executive order on immigration and refugees expected to be issued by the White House next week. A federal appeals court earlier this month suspended most of the president's Jan. 27 order temporarily barring refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and indefinitely halting the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States. That order was a blow to many affiliated with the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, which is among the city's most diverse religious communities. The mosque attracts worshipers of every age, color, and walk of life; immigrants at the leading edge of medical and scientific research pray next to newly arrived refugees with little formal education. Midday Friday prayers typically draw some 1,500 people who speak about five dozen languages. Another executive order issued Monday toughening deportation rules has also terrified people living in the Boston area without legal permission. Previous protocols prioritized the deportation of violent criminals, but the new rules widen the criteria substantially and speed up the process dramatically for some categories of people. The Roxbury mosque has developed strong relationships with city and state political figures and with the interfaith community. It is familiar ground to the mayor, who addressed the community several times in the last few years. Walsh also appeared at a large rally in support of Muslims in Copley Square on Jan. 29 after the president's travel ban was issued, and he joined protesters at Logan Airport. Shaykh Yasir Fahmy spoke warmly of seeing the mayor at the airport protest, describing, to applause, how the mayor waited until all the detainees had been released ""to make sure the last person walked out . . . he texted me and said I have the last person with me.""

39,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,"New faces, flagrant foul fuel comeback win by Raptors DeRozan, Raptors topple Celtics",,,"TORONTO — About two hours before the Celtics and Raptors were to meet in a highly anticipated matchup Friday, Toronto coach Dwane Casey revealed that Kyle Lowry, his All-Star point guard, would miss the game with a wrist injury. Suddenly, the Celtics' task appeared considerably less treacherous. By the time starting lineups were introduced, however, the mood already had shifted.","BODY Serge Ibaka, the talented forward the Raptors acquired from the Magic last week, was greeted with a thunderous ovation prior to his first game with his new team, and then he thrived. Their other new piece, gritty reserve P.J. Tucker, did not enter the game until later, but his impact was sizable, too. And for the Celtics, who stood pat as the trade deadline came and went Thursday, their 107-97 loss could serve as a warning that Toronto's reinforcements could prove devastating when the playoffs arrive. Ibaka, who had completed just two practices with his new team, had 16 points, 7 rebounds, and a block. Tucker, the former Sun, arrived in Toronto on Friday morning, took a physical exam, and then joined his new teammates just hours after meeting some of them. He had 9 points and 10 rebounds. They were the game's two leading rebounders. ""Defensively we knew they were going to play physical,"" Celtics forward Jae Crowder said of Tucker and Ibaka. ""They controlled the glass the whole game. Ibaka was in the paint the whole game and had his way."" And, of course, even though the Raptors did not have Lowry, they did have their other All-Star, DeMar DeRozan, who has been a nuisance against the Celtics this season. DeRozan poured in 43 points, many coming from an elegant array of midrange jump shots. The Celtics are still in second place in the East, but their lead over Toronto has been cut to three games. And, with Friday's win, the Raptors won the season series, 3-1, meaning they will hold the playoff tiebreaker if the teams finish with the same record. Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas struggled through one of his worst offensive games of the season. He made 6 of 17 shots and had 20 points. He has been the league's most dominant fourth-quarter scorer this season, but in this game he was mostly subdued, going just 1 for 6 from the floor and even erring on one of his two free throws. ""Every time I came off a pick they had two or three guys on me, so their point of emphasis was probably to stop me in the fourth quarter,"" Thomas said. ""And they did a good job of that. They played harder than us in the second half. They got the loose balls."" Afterward, the Celtics all lamented their uncharacteristically self-centered play. Al Horford said the ball was not moving around the perimeter like it does when the team is clicking. Marcus Smart said that the Celtics cannot simply depend on Thomas to save them. ""He needs help,"" Smart said. ""Other guys have to step up and relieve Isaiah, so when he gets that shot he's open. We can't just all put it on his shoulders. Sometimes we get caught doing that, instead of helping Isaiah."" Horford, who has been one of the Celtics' lead facilitators this year, attempted just five shots. After the game he acknowledged that he needs to shoot more than that, and Thomas concurred. ""And that's my job,"" Thomas said. ""So I'll do a better job of getting him the ball Sunday [against Detroit] and making sure he's in the flow of the game, not just defensively but offensively as well."" Late in the second quarter with the Celtics leading, 48-37, Thomas broke free on a fast break and was shoved to the ground by DeMarre Carroll before he could reach the basket. Thomas immediately sprang to his feet, rushed toward Carroll, and pointed at him. Crowder came to Thomas's aid as well. After a lengthy review, Carroll received a flagrant-1 foul and a technical foul, and Crowder and Thomas both were called for technicals. After the free throws, Jaylen Brown scored on a smooth pull-up inside and then hit a 3, giving Boston its largest lead, 55-38. Then with 1:19 left, Thomas received a flagrant-1 foul after shoving DeRozan. He hit both free throws and then Tucker hit a 3, helping Toronto close the half with a 7-0 burst to slice the deficit to 55-45. That sequence may have energized the Raptors, who continued their run in the third period. ""Yeah they turned it up,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""I thought they just from maybe from that point on or maybe just toward the end of the half, they went to a different level and we didn't match it."" Ibaka scored 7 points over the first six minutes. His 3-pointer with 5:58 left gave the Raptors a 65-63 lead, their first since the opening quarter. In all, Toronto went on a 30-8 run after Thomas's flagrant foul late in the second quarter. In the fourth period, with the scored tied at 88, Crowder banked a 3-pointer off the glass with the shot clock running down. But the Raptors answered quickly with a 7-0 run that was capped by a DeRozan 20-footer. With 1:46 left, Crowder hit a long 2-pointer just inside the 3-point line that made it 97-94. Carroll then missed a 3-pointer from the corner, but the Celtics were unable to corral the rebound. DeRozan then made them pay by drilling another 20-footer, stretching the lead to 5 with one minute left.

50,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Indians' Brantley back in the swing,,,"Indians outfielder Michael Brantley participated in regular batting practice for the first time in training camp this year, a significant step in his latest comeback from a shoulder injury. Brantley took 120 swings in an outdoor batting cage Friday in Goodyear, Ariz., as several Cleveland coaches and medical director Lonnie Soloff watched intently. Brantley had been limited to soft-toss workouts, but he was able to take full cuts against normal pitches. ""He looks real good,"" batting coach Ty Van Burkleo said. ""If you didn't know he was rehabbing, you'd think he was just getting ready for the day. His volume is up. He looks really good. The ball's coming off his bat nicely.""","BODY The 29-year-old Brantley played in just 11 games last season as he was unable to make a full recovery following offseason surgery on his right shoulder. He had another operation in August to relieve tendinitis in his biceps. Brantley has been pleased with his progress, and the AL champion Indians are taking a cautious approach after so many setbacks last season. ""I don't think he could do anything differently, the way he went through it,"" Van Burkleo said. ""He's worked his butt off from the beginning to get where he is now. We just hope there's no setbacks. Right now, he's feeling real good and there's not any issues. Hopefully, it stays that way."" An All-Star in 2014, Brantley initially injured his shoulder diving for a ball on Sept. 22, 2015. Strop, Cubs go bigger The Cubs and reliever Pedro Strop agreed to a contract adding $6.35 million in guaranteed money through 2018, a deal that includes a club option for 2019. Strop agreed earlier this month to a $5.5 million, one-year contract. The new deal calls for a $5.85 million salary in 2018 and a $6.25 million club option for 2019 with a $500,000 buyout. If the option is exercised, he could make $750,000 in performance bonuses in 2019: $250,000 each for 45, 50 and 55 games finished. Strop went 2-2 with a 2.85 ERA in 54 appearances last year, helping Chicago win the World Series for the first time since 1908. Strop, known for wearing his hat off to the side, and ace righthander Jake Arrieta were acquired in the same July 2013 trade with Baltimore. Strop, 31, is 15-20 with a 3.23 ERA in eight seasons with the Rangers, Orioles, and Cubs. He will make $5.5 million this season and $5.85 million next year. Switching sports Former NFL defensive back Sanders Commings, 26, agreed to a minor league deal with the Braves. Commings, an outfielder who hasn't played baseball since high school in Augusta, Ga., was drafted by the Diamondbacks but chose to play college football at the University of Georgia. Commings was a fifth-round pick by Kansas City in the 2013 NFL Draft, but was released after two injury-plagued seasons. Reds' Herrera ailing Dilson Herrera has inflammation in his right shoulder and will not throw for a couple days, taking the Colombian infielder out of the World Baseball Classic and hurting his chances for making the Reds. Herrera, who turns 23 next Friday, also experienced shoulder soreness for parts of last season, including during spring training. He said it started bothering him again about a week ago. The Reds acquired Herrera when they traded Jay Bruce to the Mets last summer. ""I'm OK. Sometimes we've got to be strong, get the mind right so we're ready for everything, so I feel normal,"" Herrera said. Reds manager Bryan Price said Herrera probably won't throw again until Monday or Tuesday. Herrera spent last season in the minors, hitting .274 with 15 homers and 64 RBIs in 110 games with Triple A Las Vegas and Louisville. He is a .215 hitter in 49 career major league games, all with the Mets. Wieters joins Nationals Matt Wieters took batting practice and ran conditioning sprints with the Nationals after his signing was announced. Wieters's contract is worth $10.5 million in 2017, and the 6-foot-5-inch catcher has a player option for another $10.5 million in 2018 . . . The Cardinals signed Cuban outfielder Jose Adolis Garcia to a minor league contract and invited him to their big league camp. Garcia, the younger brother of Braves third baseman Adonis Garcia, was the MVP of Cuba's top professional league last year and was declared a free agent by Major League Baseball in December. Adolis Garcia, who turns 24 next week, led Tigres de Ciego de Avila to consecutive Serie Nacional championships in 2015 and 2016. A righthanded hitter, he batted .315 with a .395 on-base percentage and .517 slugging percentage during his MVP campaign in Cuba. He also played briefly for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan last season . . . The Hanwha Eagles in South Korea agreed to a $1.5 million, one-year contract with pitcher Carlos Villanueva, whom they plan to use as a starter. The 33-year-old righthander was 2-2 with a 5.96 ERA last year in 51 relief appearances for San Diego. Villanueva, an 11-year veteran, was 51-55 with a 4.31 ERA in 76 starts and 400 relief appearances for the Brewers (2006-10), Blue Jays (2011-12), Cubs (2013-14), Cardinals (2015), and Padres.

53,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Bradley sits out again Celtics' Bradley still out,,,"TORONTO — As the trade deadline came and went Thursday without the Celtics making a move, president of basketball operations Danny Ainge stressed that he wanted to see what this team was capable of when completely healthy. Despite a seemingly endless string of short-term but persistent injuries, the Celtics nudged into second place in the Eastern Conference. And now they are just waiting for one of their primary pieces to return. Boston had been hopeful guard Avery Bradley, who has missed 21 of the past 22 games, would return from a strained Achilles' tendon to face the Raptors Friday. Prior to the team's morning shootaround, Bradley said he believed he was 100 percent healthy. But the team's training staff remained reluctant to fully clear him as he works through a medical checklist.","BODY ""They wrote down where they wanted me to be and they want me to follow it and I don't know,"" Bradley said. ""I guess we're trying to meet in the middle somewhere. I'll see what they let me do."" After starting Thursday's practice, Bradley was informed he would take part in only about one-third of it. He said he was hopeful he could play a few minutes against Toronto, but coach Brad Stevens later made it clear that was not really an option. Stevens said Bradley completed a ""great"" one-on-one workout at the conclusion of Friday's shootaround and that he would do something similar Sunday in Detroit. The belief is that he will return soon. ""I think one of the things we want to really be careful with is coming off this All-Star break, only practicing once, is making sure that when he gets back we don't have a situation where he reinjures himself,"" Stevens said, ""so he's just able to go full throttle at the right pace and the right progression from there."" Jaylen Brown, who missed the last three games because of a strained hip flexor, returned to the starting lineup and contributed 13 points in 28 minutes of action in the 107-97 loss. Forward Gerald Green did not travel to Toronto as he continues to nurse a heel injury. Lowry sidelined Less than two hours before tipoff, Raptors coach Dwane Casey revealed that All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry would miss the game because of a right wrist injury. Casey said Lowry was injured Feb. 15 against Charlotte. He received medical treatment last weekend and played in the All-Star Game, but then he had a setback. ""He woke up this morning and it wasn't any better,"" Casey said, ""so it is what it is."" It is unclear how long Lowry will remain sidelined. With the win, the Raptors trail the Celtics by three games in the East. Changing sides The Lakers' hiring of Rob Pelinka as their general manager directly affected Bradley, who had been represented by Pelinka and Landmark Sport Group for the past year. Bradley said he plans to stay with Landmark but has yet to select a representative. ""There's a few different people that are in the office and we're going to sit down and discuss,"" Bradley said. ""But Landmark, obviously Rob is one of the reasons why I chose Landmark, but the agency, what they represent is the real reason why I chose. I'm definitely staying."" Bradley said Pelinka called him this week to let him know of his decision to enter the Lakers' front office. ""We had a relationship and I was aware of certain opportunities that could have came his way,"" Bradley said. ""When he had that opportunity, I knew it was one he was going to take. I'm happy for him. They got a hell of a GM, that's all I can say."" Sullinger cut loose Although it was a quiet trade deadline for the Celtics, former Boston forward Jared Sullinger was traded by the Raptors to the Suns Thursday. According to multiple reports, Phoenix intends to complete a buyout agreement with Sullinger, who signed a one-year deal with Toronto this season after spending his first four pro seasons with the Celtics. He was sidelined by offseason foot surgery and had struggled since his return, averaging just 3.4 points and 2.5 rebounds in 11 games with the Raptors. Bradley, for one, is hopeful his former teammate gets a new chance this year. ""It's unfortunate, but I feel like maybe it's a blessing in disguise,"" he said. ""Maybe he gets another opportunity to go out and work hard and get an opportunity so he can show his talent."" Gary Washburn of the Globe staff contributed.

19,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Gronk says he will be ready in '17,,,Ron Gronkowski missed the Patriots' playoff run because of back surgery. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski said Friday he's certain he'll be ready for the start of the 2017 NFL season.,"BODY ""Yes for sure,"" he said in an ESPN interview. ""No doubt."" The Patriots, as Super Bowl champions, will host the season-opening game in 2017. It likely will be Thursday, Sept. 7. Gronkowski missed the Patriots' final five games of the regular season and all of the playoffs, including Super Bowl LI, because of a back injury. He had surgery Dec. 2, and the Patriots placed him on injured reserve Dec. 3. Gronkowski also discussed how long he expects to play in the NFL. ""I'm not really sure. I mean, I still love playing the game, and as of right now I want to play as long as I possibly could play,"" he said. ""My mind-set is to keep on going."" Gronkowski, 27, has missed 22 career games because of injuries, which have included a torn ACL, a broken forearm that required four surgeries, and two surgeries on his back. Gronkowski also missed his final season of college football in 2009 because of surgery to repair a herniated disk. Gronkowski also missed two games, and most of two others, to start the 2016 season because of a pulled hamstring. One thing that made Gronkowski's recovery a bit easier was the outcome of the Super Bowl and watching commissioner Roger Goodell hand Tom Brady the MVP trophy the next day. ""It was great to see him hand over that trophy for sure. I was super-happy for Tom,"" Gronkowski said. And what about if Goodell wants to come to Foxborugh for a Patriots game next season? ""I really don't think so. The fans are nuts, they're wild, and they have the Patriots' back no matter what, they have Tom's back. I'm telling you, [Goodell] won't get through the highway if fans saw him,"" Gronkowski said. ""I don't even think he can land in the airport in Boston because Patriots fans are the best fans, they're the most loyal fans, I'm telling you they might just carry out Roger themselves."" Compensatory picks awarded The Patriots gained compensatory draft picks in the third and fifth rounds of the 2017 draft — Nos. 103 and 185 overall. The fifth-round pick came by virtue of losing more free agents than they gained last offseason. The Patriots lost Akiem Hicks and Tavon Wilson and added Shea McClellin. They also picked up the Cleveland Browns' third-round compensatory pick as part of the Jamie Collins trade. That trade gave the Patriots Cleveland's fourth-round pick, unless the Browns were awarded a third-round compensatory pick, which they were on Friday. The Patriots will have the 32nd pick in the first round, plus one pick in the second, fourth and seventh rounds, and two picks in both the third and fifth rounds. The draft is April 27-29 in Philadelphia.

If that mandate were repealed, many workers would be unable to afford replacement insurance.","BODY The pain, suffering, and unnecessary deaths implicit in a large increase of uninsured Americans is hard to imagine. But there is a way to avoid that result while leveling the entrepreneurial playing field: universal, single-payer insurance. With this approach, public and private options would be available to provide care, and everyone could obtain care. Many countries have proved the efficacy of government insurance for everyone.

44,"Newspaper, Newspapers",LIVING ARTS,,The Honda Civic is back as a hatchback,,,"Most people who remember the original Civic that Honda brought to America in 1973 remember it as a hatchback. The less popular ""sedan"" looked exactly the same — it just had a tiny rear door instead of the liftgate. That runt of a car went on to do big things for Honda. The car's CVCC engine, which ran on both regular and unleaded gasoline (without a catalytic converter), showed Detroit and consumers that Honda had engineering chops to spare. Yes, there once were two kinds of gasoline. And I grew up with only four television stations. But that's a different story.","BODY The once stubby Civic grew into sleek coupes and sedans. By 2005, automotive trends had changed so much that the very body style that set up Honda for success vanished from its US lineup. But everything old is new again. The Civic hatch is back. With 4.4 inches taken off the rear overhang, the aggressive sheet metal creases don't play out as smoothly as on the sedans. But even with less length, the hatchback remains more useful than the sedan or coupe because its yawning opening swallows 10-speed bikes whole (another thing popular back in the '70s). I drove the Sport model that retails for $22,175, plus those pesky taxes and such. The Sport, most easily spotted by its center-mounted exhaust, is a basic car. The only major option available is an $800 continuously variable automatic transmission. You want a better sound system? That's what the aftermarket is for. Or, move up to the Sport Touring, which throws in creature comforts plus Honda Sensing, a bundling of safety technology that includes automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Sadly, that means you give up the excellent 6-speed manual gearbox I drove and adds about $7,000 to the price (which would have bought three 1973 Civics). The Sport is not the sportiest Civic — Si and Type R models are on their way — but it's tough to get more fun and practicality for your $22,000. It's the kind of car that, after a couple of miles, gets under your skin and pushes a smile onto your cheeks. Throw it into a corner and it happily obliges, then suggests you do it again. It is also a refined runner, displaying the kind of polished dynamics found on small luxury offerings a decade ago. There are baby bottoms less smooth than the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. It puts out 180 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque when fed premium fuel. That's six more ponies than the standard Civic hatch models (which lack the Sport's more sophisticated knock sensor). And in another blast from the past, the engine is started with a key. The kind you insert and turn. Fuel economy will not disappoint. Uncle Sam rates the Sport with a manual gearbox at 30 mpg in the city, 39 on the highway. I saw high 20s in mostly urban (and spirited) driving. Going with the automatic drops the highway figure down to 36. You'll commute comfortably until Sport's low-profile tires hit a sharp bump. Those go right on through the chassis to your backside with little filtering. Moderately bolstered seats can hold a wide range of drivers in place during spirited maneuvers. Without the Touring's sunroof, the cabin is dark and monochromatic. At least it's made with good-quality plastics. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels as if it was destined for a car a full segment higher. Many cars these days have some sort of touch-screen interface. The base Sport goes the nostalgia route with a rudimentary monochromatic LCD screen reminiscent of an '80s Texas Instruments calculator. But it is super simple to operate with an honest-to-goodness volume knob and radio station buttons. Honda's old slogan, ""We Make It Simple,"" applies here. Don't worry, there's Bluetooth for pairing phones. With belts for three, the back seat has generous room for two average adults. And that's about it. There are no power ports, seat pockets, or folding armrest in the back. Putting a cup of hot coffee in the door pocket is awkward and could result in spills or burned fingers. Ask me how I know. Again, it's a $22,000 car. Remind friends they didn't pay for an Uber. Unless the dual spoilers and faux front and rear venting are too severe for your retinas, the Civic Hatchback should be on the test drive list. That list includes the Chevy Cruze Hatchback, Ford Focus, Mazda3, Toyota Corolla iM and the Volkswagen Golf. Practical, affordable, and offering a decent romp on a curvy road, the Civic has returned to its roots. Now, if only Led Zeppelin could reunite.",['ENGLISH'],790,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-9b2b82f8-f954-11e6-bd76-c58c62468900,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00093OM', 'className': 'SEDANS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CP5X', 'className': 'AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000137', 'className': 'AUTOMOTIVE FUELS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009GK4', 'className': 'GASOLINE'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DJQC', 'className': 'CONSUMERS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000622', 'className': 'ENGINEERING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000D15W', 'className': 'THIS DAY IN HISTORY'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'N515120CC', 'className': 'TELEVISION INDUSTRY'}], 'company': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'CC0002JSV', 'className': 'HONDA MOTOR CO LTD'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '93', 'className': 'NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE & PARTS MANUFACTURING'}, {'score': '93', 'className': 'NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK & UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING'}, {'score': '93', 'className': 'NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING'}], 'ticker': [{'score': '93', 'className': 'HMC (NYSE)'}, {'score': '93', 'className': '7267 (TSE)'}]}"

76,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Pulled from the sands of time,Jeep nearly buried in shed along Ballston Beach is moved to make way for migrating dune,,"A Jeep Wagoneer, believed to be from the 1960s, was pulled from the shed in two pieces. For decades, nature took its course. As the Cape Cod sand dune continued to shift with the rolling ocean tides and high winds, it overwhelmed the wooden shed where the white Jeep Wagoneer had been parked, all but burying it. And there it stayed for roughly 40 years — until Friday.","BODY The aged vehicle was plucked this week from its unintended burial plot along Ballston Beach in Truro using a front-end loader and a chain. The Jeep, believed to be a model from the 1960s, was removed so the town can begin work ripping up a portion of an adjacent public parking lot at the popular beach, where the dune has started to encroach. Rather than fight back to preserve parking, the town is going to allow the dune to ""continue to move the way it wants to,"" said Emily Beebe, Truro's assistant health and conservation agent. ""It became important to get rid of this Jeep,"" she said. ""The town is going to be moving sand off of the east side of the Ballston Beach parking lot and, once the pavement is uncovered, removing pavement and restoring the sand."" The town and homeowner had talked about how to best remove the vehicle over the years, officials said. But because a coastal dune is a natural resource area under the Wetlands Protection Act, difficulty kept mounting. With the town ready to move ahead as soon as Monday with its project, removing the Jeep took on a new sense of urgency. ""It's not an easy process. But we walked them through it,"" Beebe said. ""[A Jeep] is not something you want to have in an area where you're going to have the ocean at some point washing in."" Witnessing the Jeep's removal may seem uninteresting, but it somehow captivated a national audience. This week, calls came in to Town Hall about the vehicle from as far away as Oregon, said Town Manager Rae Ann Palmer. Palmer was intrigued herself. She remembers seeing similar Jeeps cruising the streets as a kid. On Friday, as crews from Greg Morris Landscaping arrived at the private property and prepared to unearth it, Palmer stood nearby. Workers first peeled away the sunken shed's front doors, revealing the front-facing Jeep's smiling grille. A chain was attached to the loader and then wrapped around the vehicle's axle. With a groan and a crunch, the old vehicle was wrestled out of the garage. In the end, it arrived in two pieces. ""It was fascinating,"" said Palmer. ""They opened the garage, and it was like watching a time capsule being opened."" She added, ""as they started pulling it, you just see this rising of this Jeep, kind of coming up and out, and [the contractor] pulled it out and dropped it and it was this bucket of rust."" Among the heaps of metal, however, were relics of a bygone era still in decent condition. The steering wheel was intact, the pale-green dashboard was visible, and the hubcaps were still relatively shiny. Morris, the contractor hired to move the Jeep, said the homeowner's family made off with a few trinkets. ""It was a piece of history,"" he said. ""It's all taken away now.""

In September, Cambridge biotech Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. won Food and Drug Administration approval for its drug that treats the genetic cause of the disease in a subset of patients. Observers were surprised by the decision, which overruled the agency's expert advisory panel. Sarepta's trial had only 12 patients and didn't include a control group taking a placebo, which is a widely used standard of quality in medical trials.

Music Review BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA At Symphony Hall, Feb. 23 (repeats Feb. 25). www.bso.org When Sofia Gubaidulina was a student at Moscow Conservatory, the administration would sometimes raid the student dormitories in search of forbidden music by such composers as Stravinsky, Ives, and Cage. ""Almost all Western music of the 20th century was prohibited,"" the composer said in a 1995 interview. ""Of course, we found ways . . . pulling it, so to say, 'through the back door.' "" Western music wasn't the only facet of her life of which the authorities disapproved. Since her childhood, she had been deeply religious, and her convictions frequently manifest in her music to this day.","BODY Preparing for her final examinations, she met with Russia's most prominent composer of the time, Dmitri Shostakovich. ""Don't be afraid to be yourself,"" he encouraged her. ""My wish for you is that you should continue on your own incorrect path."" Like Shostakovich, she wrote film scores to pay the bills and continued following more personal musical interests on the side. Also like Shostakovich, she was blacklisted and denounced for composing music not in line with the Soviet spirit, and nevertheless, she persisted in following her own road. Under the baton of Andris Nelsons on Thursday night, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performed the world premiere of Gubaidulina's latest landmark on her ""incorrect path,"" the Triple Concerto for violin, cello, and bayan, which is a Russian chromatic button accordion. Enamored with the accordion's ability to ""breathe,"" and dedicating the score to bayan soloist Elsbeth Moser, Gubaidulina here imbued the element of breath into every instrument. The sound of the bayan appeared with a dark major seventh dyad, and low swells of sound rolled from the basses and tuba, introducing ascending intervals in the solo cello and violin and subtle dynamic arcs in the strings. Baiba Skride drew whistling harmonics out of her violin, and in dialogue with it, Harriet Krijgh's cello line fluttered upward. It seemed a new universe was being born onstage, a cosmic egg crisscrossed with intervallic paths. Set against passages of chromatic haze, consonances and triads resounded with extra luminosity. I momentarily looked around for what I thought was a collective sigh from the crowd only to find that the cellos had slid downward en masse, and later I mistook a trombone's high keen for a yawn or a cry. The music created the illusion of human voices, the purest representation of breath, and time seemed to expand and contract with the spectrum of sounds. Near the end, the music seemed to wind back toward the muted primordial frequencies from which it came, but it was not to be. The full force of the orchestra rushed in with a blazing ascent to the heavens, Jacob's ladder in terrifying brightness. The performance of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7, ""Leningrad,"" stood as a powerful musical monument to resilience in the face of totalitarian violence. Dedicated to the city itself, its first 1942 performance in the city was by an ensemble of malnourished musicians, some of whom could barely produce sound from their instruments after a year of starvation-level rations under siege. The ""invasion theme"" of the first movement was both seductively catchy and jaw-droppingly sinister as it accreted power and volume to the beat of a snare drum. Through the first variations, Nelsons stood still with only his baton twitching, like the metronome that broadcast over Leningrad's radio stations to assure the residents that the Nazis had not seized the city. As the volume of instruments and sound increased, Nelsons became more forceful. The happy tune was laced with fury and razor-edged accents, and the strings and brass shrieked like raid sirens. (For the first time at a symphony concert, I wished I'd brought earplugs.) The simple ditty had become all-encompassing, flooding the consciousness until naught else could be sensed. After the turmoil died down, Richard Svoboda contributed a forlorn bassoon solo, evoking a lone soul wandering the streets after the all-clear siren. It was hard to relax into the sweeter second movement after such a heart-pounding ride, even with a sweet oboe solo to buoy it along. The music remained on edge, anticipating the dark burlesque waltz that interjects into the second movement and the minor-key agitation that interrupted the contemplative Adagio. The symphony is about 75 minutes long, and around the border of the third and fourth movements, energy flagged, but as the finale approached, the ensemble found more fuel. The final march to resolution was weary but resolute, with a survivor's righteous triumph.

65,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Opinion on Hernandez gets likely juror excused,,,"A woman was excused Friday from jury service in the double murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez after admitting that she wrote she ""can't believe he killed those people"" on her jury questionnaire. ""I can't believe he would do something like that,"" the woman said Friday in a soft voice in Suffolk Superior Court, while Hernandez sat just a few feet away at the same conference table.","BODY The woman also said she lives near the scene of the double murder Hernandez is accused of committing in Boston's South End. When Judge Jeffrey Locke asked the woman if she felt her proximity to the crime scene might affect her judgment, she said that it would. Locke quickly excused her, but two other people were chosen for the jury Friday, bringing the number of jurors to 14. Sixteen jurors will be selected, with four designated as alternates before deliberations begin. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in the drive-by shootings of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu in the early-morning hours of July 16, 2012. He is already serving a life sentence for the June, 2013 fatal shooting of Odin Lloyd, 27, of Dorchester. The state's highest court will review his first-degree murder conviction in that case at a later date. The Lloyd trial loomed all week over jury selection, with a number of prospective jurors saying they were aware of the prior case. Locke excused many of them, but some were chosen for the jury after assuring that they could disregard the previous conviction and judge the pending indictment solely on the evidence admitted at trial. Defense attorney Jose Baez, a flashy litigator whose prior clients include Casey Anthony, the Florida woman acquitted of murdering her toddler, used rhetorical flourishes throughout the week as he pressed jurors on whether they could judge Hernandez fairly. Speaking with his hand raised above his head, Baez leaned forward and told juror after juror that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is ""the highest standard [of proof] in American jurisprudence."" ""As he sits here, Mr. Hernandez is presumed innocent,"" Baez said repeatedly. ""He's cloaked in that. Can you sit here today and look at us and say that you will grant him that presumption of innocence?"" The jurors who were selected all answered in the affirmative. But the most dramatic response came Thursday from a juror who was ultimately excused. He locked eyes with Hernandez when Baez asked if he could afford him the presumption of innocence, and a heavy silence hung in the room as lawyers on both sides awaited his response. ""Yes,"" the man said finally. ""Is there some hesitation?"" Baez asked. ""I just like to think of everything,"" the man said. ""Why would I presume him guilty? I'm looking right at him, straight in his face. . . . I don't know the man."" Prosecutors later excused the juror with one of their peremptory challenges, after citing his criminal record, which included decades-old arrests for attempted murder and armed robbery. One of the jurors selected Friday is a native of Uzbekistan who said during questioning that he roots for the New York Giants. ""You're very brave to say that,"" Locke told the man, prompting laughter from Hernandez and his attorneys. The Giants defeated the Patriots in two Super Bowls, and Hernandez scored a touchdown in one of the losing efforts. The second juror selected Friday said she was previously arrested for shoplifting in Suffolk County and served six months probation. She said she had just arrived in the United States at the time of the incident. Prosecutor Mark Lee asked if she felt she was treated fairly in court, and she said, ""Sure."" She then exited the room so lawyers on both sides could deliberate, and a prosecutor informed Locke that the woman had a male relative with an open warrant for unarmed robbery. After some discussion, she was seated on the jury. Hernandez maintained an affable bearing throughout the week of jury selection, laughing and joking with his lawyers and the court officers during breaks. His demeanor did not go unnoticed by prosecutors, who kidded defense attorney George Leontire on Friday about Hernandez's penchant for hugging his lawyers when he entered the courtroom.

6,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,City schools open website to provide aid to immigrants,,,"Boston Public Schools launched a website Friday to inform its immigrant students and their families of their rights in an ""effort to reaffirm support for immigrants and embrace students of all cultural backgrounds.""","BODY The launch of the website comes as immigrants across the state have expressed fear that they could be targeted under President Trump's promised crackdown on unauthorized immigrants and those in violation of immigration law, an emotion that school officials say they have noticed among students and families. The school system says that nearly half of its 57,000 students speak a language other than English at home, and that they represent 139 countries. The website, ""BPS: We Dream Together,"" bpswedreamtogether.org, aims to provide information for students and their families, as well as their educators. ""The city of Boston and the Boston Public Schools will never turn their backs on families who are seeking a better life,"" Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement. ""We are committed to making sure students and families of all cultural backgrounds succeed, and feel safe and welcome in their schools and neighborhoods."" The website offers information in 15 languages on a range of immigration issues. Students and families can learn of their rights and find scholarship information for unauthorized immigrant students, a hate-crime hot line, support for Muslim families, and educational tools for teachers on how to engage in civics conversations in the classroom. The materials on the website include the texts of ""Know Your Rights"" fliers, and cultural-sensitivity materials such as an educator's guide to Islamic practices, from the Council on American-Islamic Practices, and articles on the effects of immigration on children from the American Psychological Association. The site also includes a Boston Public Health Commission flier for immigrant parents on how to handle their children's fears after the 2016 presidential election. According to school officials, the school Office of English Language Learners worked with the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Advancement to compile the resources and information. The website also lists the district's protocols for immigrant students, which states that the schools will not require families to provide information pertaining to their immigration status during enrollment. ""We will continue to stand up for all of our students and families, regardless of their immigration statuses,"" school Superintendent Tommy Chang said. ""We will welcome and teach every single student who enters our classrooms."" ""Diversity and inclusion are at the core of our values as a school system and as a city,"" he added.

72,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,Arts leaders voice their concern,Issue joint letter seeking discussions on possible federal funding cuts,,"""Do we want a nation that supports culture and the arts, or do we want one that doesn't?"" asked Paul Ha, director of MIT List Visual Arts Center.A visitor looked at works of art at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The heads of Boston's largest art museums have joined a wave of local arts leaders arguing for the importance of federal funding after recent reports that the White House could be seeking to ax the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.","BODY On Friday, the directors of five major local art museums issued a joint open letter signaling their alarm. ""During this moment of heightened national discord, the elimination of the NEA and NEH is not a cut our country can afford,"" they wrote. The letter, signed by directors of the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Institute of Contemporary Art, the Harvard Art Museums, and MIT List Visual Arts Center, called federal support ""a critical piece of the puzzle for museums."" ""Art is, at its best, a dialogue,"" they wrote. ""We hope that you'll participate in the conversation about the importance of federal funding for the arts and join us as stewards of the public good."" The letter is part of a broader effort by area arts leaders. The arts advocacy group MASSCreative is marshaling support for two arts advocacy days next month. Meanwhile the New England Foundation for the Arts is lobbying on Capitol Hill and enlisting board members to speak with people close to the Trump administration. ""There is too much at stake here,"" said Cathy Edwards, executive director of the New England Foundation for the Arts. ""The cultural sector is a major employer. Arts jobs are real jobs, and to pull back on this sector of the economy now just makes no sense."" Although the NEA's $147.9 million budget is relatively minuscule (representing just 0.004 percent of the federal budget), arts leaders say those funds have an outsize impact, generating roughly $500 million in matching support. Edwards said that every NEA dollar is matched by an additional $9 in public and private funds. Citing a 2011 NEFA study that found the New England cultural sector generates roughly $8 billion in revenue, she said, ""This really small federal investment in the arts leverages a tremendous amount in terms of employment and business assets in our region."" In Massachusetts, the NEA provided nearly $920,000 in fiscal year 2016 to the Massachusetts Cultural Council for grants and services. That's in addition to the roughly $2.7 million the endowment made in direct grants to arts groups, and the roughly $1 million it provided the New England Foundation for the Arts. Anita Walker, executive director of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, said NEA grants are essential to many of the estimated 62,000 Bay Staters who work in the arts for another reason, as well. ""When the NEA makes a grant to an artist or an organization in Massachusetts, that gives confidence to other donors or investors,"" said Walker. ""When they know that an artist or an organization has been funded by the MCC or the NEA they are much more likely to make a contribution."" Matthew Wilson, executive director of MASSCreative, said the group was coordinating with the national arts advocacy group Americans for the Arts, about an advocacy day in Washington, D.C., on March 21 and is coordinating a similar effort locally on March 28. ""The entire community is working together to figure out what a coordinated plan will be on this,"" said Wilson, adding that the group may also initiate a petition or letter-writing campaign. ""We're looking for direction from our colleagues in D.C. about timing and the extent of what the president's proposal will be. We want to make sure that we're focused and thoughtful in our response."" Several arts groups, including ArtsEmerson, World Music/CRASHarts, said they planned to participate in the upcoming advocacy days, which will include marches and lobbying politicians about the importance of arts funding. Members of the New England congressional delegation have expressed sympathy to the cause. Earlier this month New England senators Bernie Sanders, Maggie Hassan, Jack Reed, and Patrick Leahy joined other senators in a joint-letter to President Trump voicing their support for the NEA and NEH. NEFA's Edwards said she was in Washington recently, where she met with aides to Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, Senator Leahy of Vermont, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island, all of whom sit on appropriations subcommittees that handle the NEA budget. ""They are all very supportive of the arts, and we can count on them being advocates,"" said Edwards. ""But it's important that they hear and understand from their constituents what the impact of federal support is in New England."" Several arts leaders noted that a few people in or near the Trump administration appear sympathetic to the arts. They include Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, whose son created Michigan's ArtPrize; Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, who previously sat on the board of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and second lady Karen Pence, a watercolorist who has expressed interest in art therapy. ""Our board is reaching out to individuals they know who we think can provide meaningful advice to the Trump team,"" said Edwards, who declined to specify whom they were contacting. ""We're trying to engage some important behind-the-scenes conversations."" The best-case scenario, she said, would be to persuade the Trump administration to preserve the agencies in the upcoming budget. ""Everybody's hope is that the president's first budget will not zero out the arts,"" she said. ""It's not all over if the NEA is not in the president's first budget draft, but it will make things a lot harder. List director Paul Ha put the matter more starkly. ""Do we want a nation that supports culture and the arts, or do we want one that doesn't?"" he said by phone on Friday. ""When you think about what lasts in a society, it's art, culture, and architecture, and the thought of being a part of generation that doesn't want to support that — it would be a huge loss.""

""We felt that we put ourselves in a good situation to get a play-in game.""

Sophomore Josh Barton cut into the Prep lead just two minutes into the second, and sophomore Ryan Doo netted a shorthanded goal to tie the score at 8:59 of the period.

Hanson reflected on his team's tough start, as the Eagles dropped four one-goal games to teams ranked in the Globe's top 10. He said he believes his team's late-season push and strength of schedule should be enough to earn a spot in a play-in game. ""It took us some time to develop some chemistry,"" Hanson said.

78,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,Trump asserts new vision for GOP,"Will defend workers, he tells conservatives",,"President Trump gave a campaign-style speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. WASHINGTON — Attempting to put a defining framework on his tumultuous first month in office, President Trump on Friday articulated a new vision for the Republican Party as a populist defender of the working class that will challenge elites at home and abroad. Trump, speaking to hard-line GOP activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, made it clear how much the world has changed for rank-and-file Republicans since his insurgent campaign upended the party.","BODY At times, he promoted positions that could have been ripped from the playbook of liberals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. ""The GOP will be from now on the party also of the American worker,"" Trump declared. ""First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents,"" he added. ""The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first."" In a wide-ranging, campaign-style speech, Trump bashed the media, and reiterated his promises for a massive buildup of the American military, the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, and the renegotiation of trade deals. He pointed to his administration's efforts to cut back regulations as a key way to promote job growth and protect workers. After his speech, Trump signed a new executive order requiring agencies to form regulatory reform task forces to assess additional ways to eliminate regulations. The enthusiastic response to Trump's speech marked a complete turnaround for the nation's premier gathering of conservatives, which had once greeted him with skepticism. At his first appearance at the conference in 2011, Trump walked out to the song ""Money"" and drew laughs and boos from the crowd. Last year, Trump declined an invitation to speak at the event.On Friday, he explainedthat absence by sayinghe worried his ideas would be ""too controversial."" But Friday's remarks represented Trump's attempt to recast the Republican Party — and the conservatives who represent its base — in his own image. At one point, he said, ""Now you finally have a president, finally,"" and at another point, he said the Middle East is in ""much worse shape than it was 15 years ago"" — a timeframe that extends back to the presidency of Republican George W. Bush. The crowd reveled in chants of ""lock her up,"" echoing last year's campaign chants targeting Hillary Clinton, and ""USA! USA!"" underscoring Trump's appeals to nationalism. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's joke earlier in the week that CPAC should be renamed ""TPAC"" in honor of the president seemed more fitting. Trump's appearance Friday was the first by a sitting president since Bush spoke in 2003 and the first by a president in his inaugural year in office since Ronald Reagan in 1981. In all, Reagan spoke at CPAC 13 times. Trump said he plans to make annual visits to the conference. Vice President Mike Pence compared Trump to Reagan in his speech Thursday night. ""I believe President Trump has given voice to aspirations and frustrations to Americans like no leader since Reagan,"" he said. In his own speech, Trump assailed the Affordable Care Act, blamed President Obama for leaving him with ""a mess,"" and promised to halt illegal immigration. But as he gears up to deliver a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, lawmakers are going to be looking for more specifics, including how to fund his proposals. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are still trying to figure out exactly how to replace the federal health care law. They're also dealing with the lingering backlash to Trump's executive order on immigration, which sought to bar immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations before it was halted by the courts. Across the aisle, Democrats have been energized by the Trump administration, vowing to stall and prevent the president's agenda at every chance they get. Trump did not once mention his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in his speech, a surprising omission given the choice was widely heralded by conservatives. He did, however, deliver a blistering critique of the media, attacking ""fake news"" and journalists' use of anonymous sources. ""It doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it,"" Trump said about the media.""Many of these groups are part of large media corporations that have their own agenda."" His attack on the media's use of anonymous sources came less than an hourafter White House officials held a background briefing —demanding anonymity — with journalists to dispute a CNN story. CNN had reported that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asked the FBI to push back against media reports about communications between Trump aides and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. The vision Trump outlined Friday was a less extreme version of the worldview expressed by Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, who spoke Thursday about the ""deconstruction of the administrative state."" Bannon, making a rare public appearance, took the stage with Priebus and the two played down any conflict between them. But, a day before Trump's speech, attendees at CPAC on Thursday were still coming to grips with his new party and wrestling with questions of whether he is a true conservative.

15,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Metro,case without closure,A grieving mother fears that charges haven't been filed in her baby's death because of recent court reversals in child-abuse situations,,"""I'm worried that politics comes before the needs of our family,"" Lindsey Keane said.Lindsey Keane keeps a pillow with Noah Larson's face in the crib of his twin sister. Noah died of traumatic head injuries. WOBURN — Lindsey Keane takes some comfort in knowing that her baby boy's death has, in very real ways, helped others. His transplanted heart helped revive a critically ill infant boy, and his liver went to another infant who has been thriving.","BODY Still, overwhelming feelings of grief and anger dominate Keane's day-to-day life six months after her 1-year-old son, Noah Larson, died of traumatic head injuries while he and his twin sister, Emelia, were being cared for by a baby sitter. No charges have been filed, even as a state document shows that doctors also detected old skull fractures on both children and a judge has preliminarily found that the twins' injuries likely occurred at the baby sitter's home. Keane fears her son's case — and perhaps other infant murder investigations in Massachusetts — are languishing because prosecutors and assistant medical examiners may be hesitant to pursue child-abuse cases after recent courtroom setbacks. ""I'm worried that politics comes before the needs of our family,"" said Keane, 24, while in her living room in Woburn. ""Six months is a long time to have zero information."" In recent years, defense attorneys in a number of criminal cases have successfully challenged medical evidence used by law enforcement officials to prove infants died of assaults or violent shaking. The state's highest court last year vacated guilty verdicts, and ordered new trials, in two shaken-baby cases involving severe injuries to children from Haverhill and Woburn. Also, in the past few years, Middlesex County prosecutors dropped two infant murder cases — involving the deaths of a Cambridge girl and a Malden boy — after the state medical examiner's office changed the manner of the deaths from homicide to ""undetermined."" In most of these cases, defense attorneys argued that the child's fatal bleeding or fractures resulted from relatively rare medical disorders, or may have been due to accidents such as short falls from a couch. A spokeswoman for Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan declined to comment on the probe into the death of Keane's baby, other than to say the medical examiner's office has yet to release a manner of death and that ""the investigation is active and ongoing."" To Keane, the evidence indicates that someone in the baby sitter's home was responsible for Noah's tragic death on Aug. 15, 2016. She provided the Globe with a document from the state's child-protection agency that says in part, ""the current facts point to Noah's fatal injury having been sustained while in the home of his babysitter."" That same document from the Department of Children and Families noted another disturbing aspect of the case: It said doctors found that both twins had old skull fractures on the back of their heads, likely a week or so old, suggesting abuse occurred prior to Noah's fatal injuries. The twin sister also had some healing fractures near her ribs and limbs, Keane said. Keane acknowledged that someone, other than the baby sitter, could have had access to her twins while they were at the baby sitter's one-bedroom apartment. For about a year, the sitter primarily received the twins when they came, but sometimes the sitter's husband was there, as well as some other relatives. The sitter also cared for her own toddler while watching the twins, Keane said. Keane said she had a good relationship with the sitter — a former friend of Keane's — and paid her $65 a day to care for the twins while she worked part time in office jobs and sales and the twins' father, Paul Larson, 26, worked as a solar energy surveyor. The Globe attempted to reach the baby sitter for her account, but was unsuccessful. When the old injuries were discovered, Keane said, state investigators also felt the need to check out whether she or Paul could be responsible. Social workers temporarily removed Emelia and Keane's 7-year-old daughter, from a different relationship, from the Woburn apartment that she and Paul shared. The two children were placed with grandparents. Keane said she understood the need for those precautions, and sought to be open with investigators, including about all the ups and downs that she and Paul have experienced as young, sometimes struggling, parents. She said they were reunited with the children three weeks later. Records show state investigators began focusing on what happened in the baby sitter's home, and a judge concluded it was also highly unlikely multiple people assaulted the twins. A spokeswoman for the DCF declined to say if the baby sitter's child remains in her custody. Child-protection advocates say it's too early to say whether prosecutors have become timid in the wake of recent courtroom challenges. They say many infant homicide cases that rely primarily on medical evidence are known to take months, if not years, to develop, and some never go forward because of a lack of solid evidence to convict an individual. In a different county, the cause of another baby's death is also pending. A spokeswoman for the Plymouth County district attorney's office said that ""the investigation is ongoing"" into the death last December of a 2-year-old Brockton child, who apparently suffered head injuries while in the care of the mother's boyfriend. These days, Keane said she does everything in her power to draw public attention to Noah's death, hoping prosecutors don't forget her brown-haired, mild-mannered son who had a smile for everyone. Through tears, she said she often revisits that moment when she got the call from the sitter saying Noah was unresponsive, and then paramedics were called. She said she has to live with the belief that she made a child-care decision that proved deadly, even though the setup once seemed quite ideal. ""She was someone we trusted,"" Keane said.

Having firsthand knowledge of running a business, I have certain insights about the value of employees that Jeff Jacoby may not have (""ACA's burden on small business,"" Opinion, Feb. 15).","BODY Jacoby wrote about a debate between Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders regarding the Affordable Care Act. An audience member said that she was concerned because the ACA would force her to provide health insurance to her employees if she grew her Fort Worth hair salon business to more than 50 people. She claimed that she could not afford to do this. Jacoby used it as an example of one of the ACA's worst defects. I am well aware of the expense of providing medical insurance to employees. We have done it for years and have experienced significant cost increases almost every year. My question to the woman from Texas and Jacoby is this: What about her employees? If they are like our employees, they are the essential component of success. Do they have health insurance now? If not, what happens when they need health care? Does the owner have health insurance? Nowhere in his column was the basic problem addressed. All people need and deserve basic health care. It is a right, not just reserved for a privileged few. Too many people have to choose between food, rent, and health care. Complaining about the ACA won't fix a thing. Where is the column offering solutions instead of complaints? Should the government pay for health insurance for all? Should all businesses be mandated to supply it? Should employees go without insurance and either stay sick or go broke paying to get medical help? The hairdressers in Texas are real people with real, life-changing concerns.

24,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,,Central Mass. firm agrees to use union labor,Will sign contract with carpenters guild,,"A Lunenburg construction company that last year said it would pay $2.4 million to settle wage and hour violations brought by the US Department of Labor has agreed to become a union contractor, after being under pressure for years to follow labor laws.","BODY Force Corp. owner Claudio da Silva said in a statement that the company decided to sign an agreement with the New England Regional Council of Carpenters ""because we understand the challenges of the open shop [non union] sector and the opportunities in the union construction world."" He said Force will ""look forward to bidding in a level playing field environment"" by using union labor, and providing union benefits and training to its employees. Force and an executive who has long been a manager there, Juliano Teles Fernandes, were part of a Globe report last year on construction contractors that subject workers — particularly undocumented immigrants — to low pay and unsafe work conditions. Fernandes and companies he had owned or managed had been cited by federal safety regulators for more than 100 violations between 2007 and 2016, including some that endangered workers' lives, according to public records. In one case, Luis Mayancela broke his leg after falling through the roof of a house he was working on in Portland, Maine, in 2013. Mayancela was 15 years old at the time of the incident. Over his career, Fernandes has racked up fees and fines of $1.5 million with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which remain unpaid. Federal prosecutors have sued to collect that money. The company has so far paid $388,000 in the settlement over unpaid wages, according to the Labor Department, and another payment is due in April. That case involves back wages for 478 workers. Fernandes has complained in the past that the carpenters union was destroying his business by reporting alleged violations to the government. Mark Erlich, executive secretary-treasurer of the powerful carpenters union, said the agreement with Force is a fitting final act before he retires at the end of the month. ""I spent my career trying to eliminate the underground economy in construction. This is one more block in accomplishing that,"" Erlich said. He said the timing of the deal was unrelated to the Trump administration's new crackdown on undocumented workers. Contractors in New England often rely on immigrant workers, including those who are undocumented, to fill jobs. Many undocumented workers cannot join a union, with its higher pay and benefits, because they lack working papers. Force is moving its offices to Leominster next week, a union representative said.

77,"Newspaper, Newspapers",EDITORIAL OPINION,Editorial,About those tax returns . . .,,,"Over the next few years, states will play a critical role in pushing back against Trumpism. But they will have to wage a smart resistance, lest it backfire. Case in point: Massachusetts is one of several states considering legislation that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they want to qualify for the ballot in those states.","BODY Done right, this kind of measure could force candidates for the highest office in the land to disclose important information to the electorate. Done wrong, it could limit voter choice and prove an embarrassment to democracy. The proposals in Massachusetts and other states like New York, California, and Maine are a response to Donald Trump's refusal to disclose his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking with decades of tradition and leaving a trail of questions about his business acumen, foreign entanglements, and other possible conflicts of interest. Congress could move to require disclosure. But that seems unlikely, at least as long as Republicans hold majorities in one or both houses. State lawmakers are right, then, to take the lead. But it's not too difficult to imagine a worst-case scenario: P Massachusetts and perhaps one or two other blue states pass laws requiring the release of tax returns; P Trump nonetheless refuses to disclose, figuring he has little chance of winning in those states; P Massachusetts looks antidemocratic and hopelessly partisan; and voters are left with no way to cast a ballot for the president of the United States, save through the indignity of a write-in. There is a way around this conundrum, though. It's known as a triggering mechanism. And it would mean the law takes effect only once a critical mass of states has passed similar measures. That way, Massachusetts would not stand alone. And with enough electoral votes at stake, presidential candidates would be forced to disclose their tax returns if they want a chance to win. There are many ways to set the trigger. Massachusetts could hold the law at bay, for instance, until states representing 270 electoral votes — enough to win the election — have passed similar measures. Perhaps a lower, but still significant threshold, would be appropriate. State Senator Michael Barrett, the Lexington Democrat behind the legislation, said he would be open to a triggering mechanism, as long as it isn't so onerous as to effectively kill the bill. And he says he'd be open to other amendments, too, including one not likely to get all that far in the Legislature: requiring state-level candidates to release their own tax returns. Now that's an interesting idea, isn't it?",['ENGLISH'],467,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-f6550b4a-fab2-11e6-a9de-2d222ca112fd,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCQ', 'className': 'US ELECTORAL COLLEGE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001342', 'className': 'POLITICAL CANDIDATES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X84', 'className': 'US STATE GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000367', 'className': 'CONFLICTS OF INTEREST'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DL87', 'className': 'DEMOCRACIES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000160', 'className': 'BALLOTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000563', 'className': 'ELECTION LAW'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N921110MM', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTS'}], 'country': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}]}"
57,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,,Patrick sets sights on Daytona splash Patrick hopes to make early statement at Daytona,,,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Danica Patrick is not a fan of average. Never was. The problem for Patrick is that in her fourth full season on NASCAR's top circuit, that is just what she became most weeks: an also-ran. Patrick had no top-10 finishes last season, and has only six in 154 career starts. In a series that typically runs 40-car fields, Patrick's average starting position last year was 25th. Her average finish was 22nd.","BODY Any way you slice it, that is average. And Patrick is the first to admit that is not good enough. ""I'm not OK with trying,"" she said Wednesday as she continued preparations for Sunday's season-opening Daytona 500. ""I don't come to participate. That's awful. I come to kill it. I come to show what I can do as a driver, because I believe in myself."" The pressing question is how long sponsors and racing fans will continue to believe in Patrick, 35 next month. More than a few NASCAR followers believe this is Patrick's make-or-break season. They include Ricky Craven, the former driver and current ­ESPN analyst, who concedes that Patrick's once wide window of opportunity may be closing. ""I feel like she's stalled in terms of progress,"" he said. Patrick, however, says she sees progress. She switched cars this season — from a Chevrolet SS to a Ford Fusion — and engines. The change in cars allows her more direct contact with a manufacturer for changes and adjustments, but it is the other switch, to Roush Yates Engines, that may make more of a difference. Last year, Patrick got her engines from Hendrick Motorsports. The problem was not one of quality, she said, but of competition: Hendrick oversaw a team in competition with Patrick's team, Stewart-Haas Racing, an arrangement akin to a golfer's having to use a rival's clubs. ""Hendrick runs a professional operation,"" Patrick said. ""But still, how can you ever be sure that you're getting the best stuff? There is more potential now. ""Roush Yates provides engines for other teams, but they don't have their own team,"" she said. ""I went to the engine shop last week, and it was just cool to hear how, if we want to work on the bottom end more, or the top end, or certain elements of the performance of the engine, we can just ask."" It might not seem like much, but in a sport often decided by inches and fractions of seconds, it can be the difference between top-tier finishes and average ones. ""We are splitting hairs out there all the time,"" Patrick said. ""You think to yourself, 'Man, if my engine performed one-10th faster on the lap, if my car was one-10th better, where would two-10ths put me?' Everything makes a difference, and there is not that much difference between everyone."" It's possible the Roush Yates engine was the difference in Sunday's 75-lap Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race, in which Patrick finished fourth. Though the result didn't earn her any points, it was the highest finish for a woman in a NASCAR-sanctioned event at Daytona International Speedway. It was also the highest finish for Patrick's SHR team. Now she wants more. To be fair, it's not as if Patrick doesn't have some significant credits on her résumé already. A former IndyCar series rookie of the year, Patrick posted her sole victory in that series in the 2008 Indy Japan 300. Should she win a NASCAR race, she would join a short list of drivers who have won races in the IndyCar series and in NASCAR. Having more control of her engine should help Patrick achieve that goal. At the same time, she knows that there will always be things beyond her control, obstacles that have held her back or, more recently, moved her toward the back of the pack. She still struggles because of her gender, she said, lamenting that lapped drivers sometimes still block her but then allow male drivers to pass. ""I don't like getting passed by a girl, so I'm sure they don't, either,"" Patrick said. ""I get that. But I've witnessed with my own eyes when somebody I'm trying to get by, somebody in lap traffic, that they're making my life a living hell. Then I watch them move over for someone else. And I'm thinking, 'Oh, my God.' This is what I deal with every single weekend."" She sighed. ""The only thing I can do is tell myself that what doesn't kill me makes me stronger,"" she said. ""It makes me better in all situations. That over time, they must get used to it. They will get used to it. And it will get easier.""",['ENGLISH'],743,Copyright 2017 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLOBE-c4d218b4-fadb-11e6-bd76-c58c62468900,,,,The Boston Globe,"{'day': '25', 'month': '02', 'year': '2017'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST0008Z79', 'className': 'AUTO RACING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X5I', 'className': 'NASCAR RACING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CFE3', 'className': 'SPORTS FANS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000800', 'className': 'GOLF'}], 'city': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000D1O3', 'className': 'DAYTONA BEACH, FL, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE0009UTK', 'className': 'DANICA PATRICK'}]}"

75,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,National,Officials enlisted to challenge reports,Asked to push back on Russia,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has enlisted senior members of the intelligence community and Congress in efforts to counter news stories about Trump associates' ties to Russia, a politically charged issue that has been under investigation by the FBI as well as lawmakers now defending the White House.","BODY Acting at the behest of the White House, the officials called news organizations last week to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trump's campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives, US officials said. The calls were orchestrated by the White House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories about contacts with Russia. The White House on Friday acknowledged those interactions with the FBI but did not disclose that it then turned to other officials who agreed to do what the FBI would not: participate in White House-arranged calls with news organizations, including The Washington Post. The White House insisted the officials speak on the condition of anonymity — a practice President Trump has condemned. The officials broadly dismissed Trump associates' contacts with Russia as infrequent and inconsequential. But the officials would not answer substantive questions about the issue, and their comments were not published by The Post and do not appear to have been reported elsewhere. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The decision to involve those officials could be perceived as threatening the independence of US spy agencies that are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues, as well as undercutting the credibility of ongoing congressional probes. Those officials saw their involvement as an attempt to correct coverage they believed to be erroneous. The effort also involved senior lawmakers with access to classified intelligence about Russia, including Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina and Representative Devin Nunes of California, the GOP chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees.
