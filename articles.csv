One,"In any given year, 98% of criminal cases in the federal courts end with a plea bargain — a practice that prizes efficiency over fairness and innocence, according to a new report from the American Bar Association.

A task force that includes prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys and academics cited ""substantial evidence"" that innocent people are coerced into guilty pleas because of the power prosecutors hold over them, including the prospect of decades-long mandatory minimum sentences.

""Trials have become rare legal artifacts in most U.S. jurisdictions, and even nonexistent in others,"" the ABA Plea Bargain Task Force wrote in a report released Wednesday.

Aside from the paltry number of trials in the federal system, states including Pennsylvania, Texas and New York have trial rates of less than three percent. In Santa Cruz County, Ariz., there were no trials from 2010 to 2012, the report said.

The prevalence of plea bargaining exploded in the last several decades as a way to save money and time and to promote more certainty in outcomes. But the practice comes with ""a very high cost,"" said Lucian Dervan, a professor at Belmont University College of Law in Nashville.

Pleas can allow police and government misconduct to go unchecked, because mistakes and misbehavior often only emerge after defense attorneys gain access to witness interviews and other materials, with which they can test the strength of a government case before trial.

The deals also exacerbate racial inequality, with Black defendants more often subject to prosecutors' stacking of multiple charges in drug and gun cases. Altogether, defendants face stiffer punishments for going to trial — known as a trial penalty — that can add seven to nine years or more to their sentence.

But most stark in the report is research that cites innocent defendants who agree to falsely plead guilty, sometimes on the advice of their own lawyers. An Innocence Project database of exonerations includes dozens of people who falsely pleaded guilty.

""This isn't just having an effect on those individuals,"" said Dervan, who co-chaired the task force. ""It's having an effect on the entire community and the safety of the entire community.""

Overhauling the justice system will be no easy task — since it could require changes to laws and ethics rules in many U.S. states. ""It's past time to start that work,"" said Dervan, who recently created the Plea Bargaining Institute to generate and share research.

The ABA task force makes 14 recommendations, including the need to collect and analyze data on plea bargains; the need to give defendants access to discovery materials before they enter a plea; and the need to eliminate bail requirements or pretrial detention when they're used to coerce someone into pleading guilty.

The report also presses prosecutors and judges not to demand or accept plea deals where defendants waive essential legal rights, such as the right to appeal and receive exculpatory information; and the right to make future claims for release for reasons of terminal illness. "
Two,"SEATTLE — The Seattle City Council on Tuesday added caste to the city's anti-discrimination laws, becoming the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination and the first in the world to pass such a law outside South Asia.

Calls to outlaw discrimination based on caste, a division of people based on birth or descent, have grown louder among South Asian diaspora communities in the United States. But the movement has been getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.

Tensions within the community were visible at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday as a noisy hearing culminated with a 6-1 vote with a majority of the council agreeing that caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.

The packed room, which overflowed with activists from both sides bearing banners, chanting slogans, challenging speakers and city officials as they made their comments, laid bare stark divisions over this issue within the South Asian diaspora. A majority of those present in council chambers were supporters of the ordinance and those opposed were a vocal minority. As council members voted in favor of the ordinance, the chamber erupted into cheers of ""Jai Bhim,"" which means ""victory for Bhim"" a rallying cry adopted by followers of B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian Dalit rights icon whose given name was Bhimrao. Dalit groups and their supporters say caste discrimination is prevalent in U.S. diaspora communities, manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.

Yogesh Mane, a Seattle resident who grew up as an untouchable in India, broke into tears as he heard the council's decision.

""I'm emotional because this is the first time such an ordinance has been passed anywhere in the world outside of South Asia,"" he said. ""It's a historic moment.""

Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, whose advocacy work along with community partners continues to push caste discrimination laws forward, called the council vote ""a culture war that has been won.""

""We got the support of over 200 organizations from Seattle and around the country,"" she said. ""It's a powerful message that Dalit people are not alone. The South Asian community has united to say we want to heal from the trauma of caste.""

Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. Sawant said the council received over 4,000 emails in support of the ordinance.

""We've heard hundreds of gut-wrenching stories over the last few weeks showing us that caste discrimination is very real in Seattle,"" she said.

Council Member Sara Nelson who cast the lone dissenting vote agreed with opponents calling the ordinance ""a reckless, harmful solution to a problem for which we have no data or research.""

""This could generate more anti-Hindu discrimination and could dissuade employers from hiring South Asians,"" she said. ""The community that is being impacted is deeply divided on this issue.""

Nelson also said the ordinance would also get the city entangled in legal battles to which Sawant responded: ""Bring it on."" Sawant said being fearful of lawsuits is not the way to effect progress or change.

Council Member Lisa Herbold questioned opponents' logic that the law singles out Hindus and people of Indian descent.

""That's like saying gender discrimination laws single out all men,"" she said. ""And just because we have a small population that is experiencing (caste discrimination) that doesn't make it any less important.""

Shobha Swamy, a representative of the Coalition of Hindus of North America said she was disappointed by the council deliberations and line of questioning. The group said they received a show of support from over 100 organizations.

""Due diligence wasn't done,"" said Swami, who flew in from Atlanta.

C.H. Srikrishna, a San Francisco Bay Area-based tech worker, said he is worried about the ramifications this ordinance might have for the South Asian community.

""I too want discrimination to end,"" he said. ""But we need to first determine that widespread discrimination exists.""

Srikrishna, who is Hindu, believes the ordinance does target his religion.

""When you say it originated 2,000 years ago, that is implicitly blaming Hinduism,"" he said. ""That bothers me. I feel betrayed.""

Sanjay Patel, a tech company owner from the Seattle area, said he never felt discriminated against in the U.S. as a member of a lower caste and that the ordinance pained him because it reminded him of a caste identity, which he thought had become obsolete.

""I fear with this law, businesses will be afraid to hire South Asians,"" he said.

Earlier Tuesday morning, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting where more than 300 people had requested to speak virtually and in person. They heard about half of the comments before moving on to deliberations and the vote.

The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one's occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid — known as Dalits — has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation's independence from British rule.

The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination.

In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union."
Three,"A word to those working hard to make sure that Black history is erased: It’s going to be harder than you think. Sure, you’ve banned books by Black people writing about America’s fraught racial history, and passed legislation censoring classroom discussions about the breadth and depth of African-Americans’ contributions to our nation. The opening narration for “The 1619 Project,” the new Hulu series based on the New York Time series of the same name, puts it plainly: “Almost nothing in our country has been left untouched by the legacy and the contributions of Black Americans.”

As any informed person knows, history is inescapable — because today is rooted in the past. Even banned and censored history finds its way into the center of the public conversation of the moment. As I was recently reminded when the Super Bowl teams were announced — say what? I know some of you who know me are asking. How is it that I — an avowed couldn’t-care-less sports person — was paying attention to football’s most important game? Easy — I sat up and took notice the minute the sports analysts pointed out that for the first time ever in the 56-year history of the Super Bowl, both competing teams had Black quarterbacks. Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Philadelphia Eagles Jalen Hurts made history — Black History. The news transcended viral with endless discussions on every media platform. There was no getting away from the profiles of both young men, the multiple interviews asking each of them to reflect on the importance, and the particular pride of Black fans.

My Dad would have had the story on a loop. I remember Daddy told me the Black players were shut out from playing quarterback because the decision-makers assumed they didn’t have the intellect needed to strategize for the team. How you like me now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis? You, who are focused on ripping African American history from books and classrooms? You can’t stop the kids from witnessing talent and triumph overcoming racial bias. You might want to brush up on the words to “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Negro National Anthem.

Even sweeter, Mahomes and Hurts were not the only recent Black firsts breaking down restricted classroom walls. Here at home, Mount Holyoke College named Danielle Ren Holley as the first Black president in the college’s 186-year history. She’ll be the fourth Black woman to helm one of the original Seven Sisters colleges. Two others based in Massachusetts, Wellesley and Smith, are also led by Black women.

I’ll close out this short list of living Black history makers with another sports highlight: Basketball superstar LeBron James toppling the awe-inspiring record of retired Kareem Abul Jabbar, taking the number one spot on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. Both men never fail to put their achievements within the larger context of Black history. In this last week of Black History Month, I’m heartened that even if some don’t like it, Americans are still learning Black history through these current stories — stories that are now forever etched into the stone of American history."
Four,"The creator of the Dilbert comic strip faced a backlash of cancellations Saturday while defending remarks describing people who are Black as members of ""a hate group"" from which white people should ""get away.""

Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments by Dilbert creator Scott Adams as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.

Andrews McMeel Syndication, which distributes Dilbert, did not immediately respond Saturday to requests for comment. But Adams defended himself on social media against those whom he said ""hate me and are canceling me.""

Dilbert is a long-running comic that pokes fun at office-place culture.

The backlash began following an episode this past week of the YouTube show, ""Real Coffee with Scott Adams."" Among other topics, Adams referenced a Rasmussen Reports survey that had asked whether people agreed with the statement ""It's OK to be white.""

Most agreed, but Adams noted that 26% of Black respondents disagreed and others weren't sure.

The Anti-Defamation League says the phrase was popularized in 2017 as a trolling campaign by members of the discussion forum 4chan but then began being used by some white supremacists.

Adams, who is white, repeatedly referred to people who are Black as members of a ""hate group"" or a ""racist hate group"" and said he would no longer ""help Black Americans.""

""Based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people,"" Adams said on his Wednesday show.

In another episode of his online show Saturday, Adams said he had been making a point that ""everyone should be treated as an individual"" without discrimination.

""But you should also avoid any group that doesn't respect you, even if there are people within the group who are fine,"" Adams said.

The Los Angeles Times cited Adams' ""racist comments"" while announcing Saturday that Dilbert will be discontinued Monday in most editions and that its final run in the Sunday comics — which are printed in advance — will be March 12.

The San Antonio Express-News, which is part of Hearst Newspapers, said Saturday that it will drop the Dilbert comic strip, effective Monday, ""because of hateful and discriminatory public comments by its creator.""

The USA Today Network tweeted Friday that it also will stop publishing Dilbert ""due to recent discriminatory comments by its creator.""

The Plain Dealer in Cleveland and other publications that are part of Advance Local media also announced that they are dropping Dilbert.

""This is a decision based on the principles of this news organization and the community we serve,"" wrote Chris Quinn, editor of The Plain Dealer. ""We are not a home for those who espouse racism. We certainly do not want to provide them with financial support.""

Christopher Kelly, vice president of content for NJ Advance Media, wrote that the news organization believes in ""the free and fair exchange of ideas.""

""But when those ideas cross into hate speech, a line must be drawn,"" Kelly wrote."
Five,"Throughout the African American and African diaspora, food takes on as many different forms and traditions as the people who make it up.

Enslaved Africans brought their cooking and farming traditions to the Americas, and those were then transformed by the conditions they faced. The heritage of many recipes considered today to be soul food were founded in the crops and techniques first developed by enslaved communities.

Today, Black chefs and restaurant owners are bringing traditional elements into their recipes and adding their own creativity, as well as sharing recipes from all corners of the globe.

But through all the different flavors is the same heart: community.

Kwasi Kwaa, chef and partner of Comfort Kitchen in Dorchester, is one person bringing these foods to the forefront in Boston. He whipped up jackfruit sliders with jerk seasoning on the set of Basic Black.

Kwaa, who is from Ghana, said tastes are changing as people become more adventurous with food. He started his career making lots of French and Italian food, despite wanting to explore African cuisine, which he described as a sad period of his career. But now, there's a paradigm shift.

""I think in past years, and with the help of television ... and food shows and things like that, people have broadened their horizons in terms of what they can try, and folks have become more adventurous eaters, if you would,"" Kwaa said.

As people branch out to try new foods, they also love the classics, such as what is served up at Coast Café in Cambridge, where Anthony ""Tony"" Brooks is the chef and owner.

His fried chicken and mac and cheese is pure home cooking. Brooks made his signature mac and cheese on Basic Black, which he said is his most popular side dish.

That home cooking is what customers are looking for. Brooks said, ""We're cooking from our heart and people are looking for that artist ... I look at it as art to me, not just cooking.""

Paula Austin, assistant professor of history and African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, described Black food as diverse, and a ""cultural explosion"" that varies from region to region. Mac and cheese in one state might not be the same recipe in another state, or another part of the world even.

""Black foodways is not monolithic, but there are so many different things that come together to make the particular dishes or to make those particular preparations that are, you know, West African, Indigenous,"" Austin said.

The guests closed out the segment sharing some of the favorite foods that are always making it onto their plate. Austin loves fried plantains, Brooks eats steak and potatoes and Kwaa loves chicken stock more than he loves a whole roast chicken."
